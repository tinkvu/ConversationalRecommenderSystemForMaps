            "Context: Place Name: 14 Henrietta Street, Reviews: The museum is very good. I highly recommend it to know more about georgian houses and Dublins life. The experience was overall really good. However, the tour was with a group of 20 people, and the rooms are not big enough to appreciate all with big groups. The museum should consider this. The guide was ok, good information but with no group management at all. He started to talk before the group was inside the room. Ive lost half of the tour because of this. This museum tells an important story about perseverance, community building, social class, and the spirit struggle for social justice in Ireland with lessons all societies. 14 Henrietta invites visitors to look inside this Irish history with empathy and build capacity to confront disparities in any way one can. Excellent tour narrative and engaging use of technology. A must visit for locals and tourists. A real look into tenement life in Dublin and the history on how it started. Lloyd was our guide and was brilliant. He is a local who was born and bread close by which added to the experience hearing the history and stories with a local accent and colloquialisms. We learned so much about the history of Dublin on this guided tour, as it related to the people who lived at this location. It is a gorgeous block, used for many film shoots. You would never believe that thousands of people lived in poverty and squalor in these houses that were once grand but then turned into tenements. The last tenant moving out in 1979!! Great place to visit.  Go back in time to the 1700s  through to the 1970s as your guided through the house.  Great guide, and the buildings rooms help transport you to the lives of people as they lived there.  Go to this place if you have any interest in the history of dublin. This is a great historic overview of Georgian house and it s transformation from a mansion of one wealthy family in the 1700 s to tenement housing for 26 families through to the 1970 s. Gus was our tour guide and he was very knowledgeable and was happy to take questions. This is a must see tour to understand the history of Dublin. Give yourself and hour and a half for the tour. 14 Henrietta Street is a must-see in Dublin! It gives you a look into the reality of the tenement life. Our guide was knowledgeable and passionate. The tour was about 75 minutes. myself and my wife brought her parents who are from around that area , we really enjoyed the tour, Gillian was fantastic with her knowledge and strong Dublin accent which made you feel right at home, 100% recommend Booked the tour online. The tour was fantastic. I really enjoyed it. Its lasted well over an hour and a half. For  10 its well worth the visit. Our guide was full of stories. Would highly recommend coming. Wonderful guided tour of an important part of Dublins history, tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and had a deep passion for the stories she told us as we made our way around the building, those involved in preserving the building have done a great job. Great Experience absolutely Worth while. Learned alot about live and the Change from very rich to poor from 18th to 20th century. Multimedia Infos about the families in the actual rooms they lived in. Presented to small groups with room for Personal questions. I got a voucher for this just before covid. I honestly thought it would be gone out of date but the amazing staff at 14 Henrietta Street emailed to say it was still valid and would we like to book. I was honestly blown away by their kindness. We went on Sunday and from the moment we opened that very large door (!) we were met with such a welcome and warmth. Gus was our guide and he was so informative and funny. He can answer any questions so tap into his knowledge. I loved every minute Very impressive and I really stepped back in time to the Dublin tenement days! Great guide and knowledge. Well worth a visit and only sorry I never visited sooner. A very interesting museum in Dublin. Building was constructed for a wealthy family. Eventually it was subdivided into small apartments. Toward the end it was a tenement building. it was a wonderful experience learning about how housing policy in dublin changed throughout the years and the sharp contrast between the rich and the poor. highly recommend! Brilliant 1.5 hour tour of tenement life in Dublin. Jill the tour guide (I think that was her name) was amazing; so informative and passionate. She had family connections to the buildings as well as being from Dublin, therefore her accounts of the ordinary people of Dublin really brought things to life and into perspective. A real eye opener and so thought provoking. A must do for anyone visiting Dublin. You do need to book a few days before attending. For anyone interested in the social history of Dublin, this muses is an absolute must. The tour is exceptionally well organised and the guides(we had Pat, he was brilliant) are so knowledgeable and approachable. They make the awful story of Dublins tenements come to life. Absolutely brilliant museum very interesting. Well worth the 1.30 hr tour. Our guide gave us a great experience going back in time when they were first built and all the different time periods and what they were used for and how people lived. A great bit of Irish history. Id recommend this museum to anyone who is thinking of a visit. Great tour, and museum. Our guide Declan was excellent. There is a guided tour and several informative videos. An absolutely fascinating experience. Gillian was so passionate throughout the tour & you could really tell she cares about what shes talking about. She was a fountain of knowledge & could answer any and all questions about the building. A fantastic experience & I recommend it to anyone, especially Dublin locals, its surprising what you might not know about your own city! Fantastic immersive tour and cheap as chips too! Great way to spend an hour and 30 minutes. Tour guides are very knowledgeable, funny and entertaining in general. You get a great sense of what city living was like in Dublin from the late 1700s through to the Mid 1900s.  Fascinating that some people who lived in the residence are still alive and donated their experience and family memorabilia to the museum. Definitely a tour to take in Dublin. I enjoyed a hugely positive experience at 14 Henrietta Street. Its a wonderful place to visit. Our guide, Gillian, was fabulous and hugely knowledgeable, answering every question and expanding on them with extra information. I went with a work group, all of whom enjoyed it. I plan to return again and share the experience with friends and family. Would highly recommend 14 Henrietta street. Our tour guide Pat was brilliant. The tour take around 75-90 minutes. You walk through a house of history that takes you back 300 years. There s a tour every hour on the hour. If you re in Dublin,I would definitely recommend booking this experience. The tour moves through the history of the house from Georgian mansion housing one family to a tenement building housing up to 17 families. The stark contrast of these two periods is wonderfully bought together on the tour.  Our guide Declan had a passion for the house and its history which shone through in his descriptions.  The tour provided a great social history of Dublin.  Would highly recommend. Very interesting to see the history of this house in the original Georgian street in Dublin, from its origin as a residence of one of the most affluent families of the ascendancy to its later phase as a miserable tenement housing 17 families in squalor. It would be even more impressive if the acquired some typical 18th century furniture for at least one of the upper rooms. Strongly recommended. Fantastic tour for anyone interested in the social history of Dublin during the tenement housing situation. Our tour guide Frank was informative and you watch several short films throughout the tour too. There are seats in different rooms, which is good for those who need a rest in between as its a 75 minute tour through different floors. An incredible historical journey through a very interesting and, for me, unknown part of Dublins history. The tour includes very useful audio-visual aids. The guide was kind, clear and really knowledgeable. Not to be missed Captivating tour, you learn a lot of interesting facts about the history of the building (and Dublin also) from the time that was built in 1740 until the last tenants moved out, in the late 1970s. Really enjoyed the tour. Informative guides, really interesting facts about the street and Dublin in general We spent a pleasurable hour and a half on Tour with Gus!! A fountain of knowledge and enthusiasm. Bitter sweet history, brought so many familiar feelings, sights, recognition of my past familys  history and good fortune to have had jobs and careers.  Dublin has a  mixed history of fortunes won and lost.  14 Henrietta Street is a super museum and a must see, especially for the Irish, not just Dubliners!! This is a hidden gem in Dublin. The guided tour takes you around this house doing a wonderful job to portray how a bourgeois-made house was transformed to housing appartements for the poor living in squalor. Its one of the best museums i have ever visited (and i have visited a lot). Dont miss it, it will worth your time. One of the best tours Ive been in Dublin!!! Impressive work is done here to preserve history, the good and beautiful but also the bad and ugly. Very important. The stuff is great. The tour guide is very very good, he spoke in a very passionate way, you can feel he is involved in the preservation work and that he cares about what he is talking! Pat provided an excellent tour filled with insightful information on the history and daily lives of the residents in this area. It was especially meaningful for me as my grandparents were raised in this community, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of their past experiences. 10/10 Such a wonderful insight into the world of one building. From opulent beginning to over crowded tenement. We had a passionate guide, Jillian, that kept us enthralled & entertained. Very emotive too, well worth a visit. I had visited Dublin before but had never visited this museum / building. From the 3 days sight seeing in the city this was the highlight of the trip. Our guide was amazing, she had a wealth of experience and a passion for the place. This was more than a job to her ( sadly I have forgotten her name but I think it began with a G), many stories (good and bad), the group were captivated, I felt myself fighting back the tears on numerous occasions. This is an amazing experience. A must-do. Very well explained and portrayed. Gillian, our guide, was informed and engaging. Would highly recommend this visit, its another world wonder This is one of the most brilliant historical tours Ive ever done.  Our guide could not have done more to bring history to life. She was amazing.  Be warned,  its a very moving experience - I was moved to tears more than once.   Fantastic. Fabulous. Absolutely wonderful tour of an incredible building. Funny, emotional, entertaining and absolutely fascinating. Pat is a lovely man and an excellent guide. We ll be sure to always recommend a visit to people on our own walking tours! Youll never understand poverty until you see it displayed in front of you like you can experience in this very special museum. Brilliant tour of a building that s both been built and lived in by a General & Marquis in the 1700 d and then latterly a literal Victorian slum and then survived all the way through into the 1970s as a packed tenement building. Highlight of our trip to Dublin. Great guide and very well done films in each room.\n",

              "'Place Name: 14 Henrietta Street, Reviews: The museum is very good. I highly recommend it to know more about georgian houses and Dublins life. The experience was overall really good. However, the tour was with a group of 20 people, and the rooms are not big enough to appreciate all with big groups. The museum should consider this. The guide was ok, good information but with no group management at all. He started to talk before the group was inside the room. Ive lost half of the tour because of this. This museum tells an important story about perseverance, community building, social class, and the spirit struggle for social justice in Ireland with lessons all societies. 14 Henrietta invites visitors to look inside this Irish history with empathy and build capacity to confront disparities in any way one can. Excellent tour narrative and engaging use of technology. A must visit for locals and tourists. A real look into tenement life in Dublin and the history on how it started. Lloyd was our guide and was brilliant. He is a local who was born and bread close by which added to the experience hearing the history and stories with a local accent and colloquialisms. We learned so much about the history of Dublin on this guided tour, as it related to the people who lived at this location. It is a gorgeous block, used for many film shoots. You would never believe that thousands of people lived in poverty and squalor in these houses that were once grand but then turned into tenements. The last tenant moving out in 1979!! Great place to visit.  Go back in time to the 1700s  through to the 1970s as your guided through the house.  Great guide, and the buildings rooms help transport you to the lives of people as they lived there.  Go to this place if you have any interest in the history of dublin. This is a great historic overview of Georgian house and it s transformation from a mansion of one wealthy family in the 1700 s to tenement housing for 26 families through to the 1970 s. Gus was our tour guide and he was very knowledgeable and was happy to take questions. This is a must see tour to understand the history of Dublin. Give yourself and hour and a half for the tour. 14 Henrietta Street is a must-see in Dublin! It gives you a look into the reality of the tenement life. Our guide was knowledgeable and passionate. The tour was about 75 minutes. myself and my wife brought her parents who are from around that area , we really enjoyed the tour, Gillian was fantastic with her knowledge and strong Dublin accent which made you feel right at home, 100% recommend Booked the tour online. The tour was fantastic. I really enjoyed it. Its lasted well over an hour and a half. For  10 its well worth the visit. Our guide was full of stories. Would highly recommend coming. Wonderful guided tour of an important part of Dublins history, tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and had a deep passion for the stories she told us as we made our way around the building, those involved in preserving the building have done a great job. Great Experience absolutely Worth while. Learned alot about live and the Change from very rich to poor from 18th to 20th century. Multimedia Infos about the families in the actual rooms they lived in. Presented to small groups with room for Personal questions. I got a voucher for this just before covid. I honestly thought it would be gone out of date but the amazing staff at 14 Henrietta Street emailed to say it was still valid and would we like to book. I was honestly blown away by their kindness. We went on Sunday and from the moment we opened that very large door (!) we were met with such a welcome and warmth. Gus was our guide and he was so informative and funny. He can answer any questions so tap into his knowledge. I loved every minute Very impressive and I really stepped back in time to the Dublin tenement days! Great guide and knowledge. Well worth a visit and only sorry I never visited sooner. A very interesting museum in Dublin. Building was constructed for a wealthy family. Eventually it was subdivided into small apartments. Toward the end it was a tenement building. it was a wonderful experience learning about how housing policy in dublin changed throughout the years and the sharp contrast between the rich and the poor. highly recommend! Brilliant 1.5 hour tour of tenement life in Dublin. Jill the tour guide (I think that was her name) was amazing; so informative and passionate. She had family connections to the buildings as well as being from Dublin, therefore her accounts of the ordinary people of Dublin really brought things to life and into perspective. A real eye opener and so thought provoking. A must do for anyone visiting Dublin. You do need to book a few days before attending. For anyone interested in the social history of Dublin, this muses is an absolute must. The tour is exceptionally well organised and the guides(we had Pat, he was brilliant) are so knowledgeable and approachable. They make the awful story of Dublins tenements come to life. Absolutely brilliant museum very interesting. Well worth the 1.30 hr tour. Our guide gave us a great experience going back in time when they were first built and all the different time periods and what they were used for and how people lived. A great bit of Irish history. Id recommend this museum to anyone who is thinking of a visit. Great tour, and museum. Our guide Declan was excellent. There is a guided tour and several informative videos. An absolutely fascinating experience. Gillian was so passionate throughout the tour & you could really tell she cares about what shes talking about. She was a fountain of knowledge & could answer any and all questions about the building. A fantastic experience & I recommend it to anyone, especially Dublin locals, its surprising what you might not know about your own city! Fantastic immersive tour and cheap as chips too! Great way to spend an hour and 30 minutes. Tour guides are very knowledgeable, funny and entertaining in general. You get a great sense of what city living was like in Dublin from the late 1700s through to the Mid 1900s.  Fascinating that some people who lived in the residence are still alive and donated their experience and family memorabilia to the museum. Definitely a tour to take in Dublin. I enjoyed a hugely positive experience at 14 Henrietta Street. Its a wonderful place to visit. Our guide, Gillian, was fabulous and hugely knowledgeable, answering every question and expanding on them with extra information. I went with a work group, all of whom enjoyed it. I plan to return again and share the experience with friends and family. Would highly recommend 14 Henrietta street. Our tour guide Pat was brilliant. The tour take around 75-90 minutes. You walk through a house of history that takes you back 300 years. There s a tour every hour on the hour. If you re in Dublin,I would definitely recommend booking this experience. The tour moves through the history of the house from Georgian mansion housing one family to a tenement building housing up to 17 families. The stark contrast of these two periods is wonderfully bought together on the tour.  Our guide Declan had a passion for the house and its history which shone through in his descriptions.  The tour provided a great social history of Dublin.  Would highly recommend. Very interesting to see the history of this house in the original Georgian street in Dublin, from its origin as a residence of one of the most affluent families of the ascendancy to its later phase as a miserable tenement housing 17 families in squalor. It would be even more impressive if the acquired some typical 18th century furniture for at least one of the upper rooms. Strongly recommended. Fantastic tour for anyone interested in the social history of Dublin during the tenement housing situation. Our tour guide Frank was informative and you watch several short films throughout the tour too. There are seats in different rooms, which is good for those who need a rest in between as its a 75 minute tour through different floors. An incredible historical journey through a very interesting and, for me, unknown part of Dublins history. The tour includes very useful audio-visual aids. The guide was kind, clear and really knowledgeable. Not to be missed Captivating tour, you learn a lot of interesting facts about the history of the building (and Dublin also) from the time that was built in 1740 until the last tenants moved out, in the late 1970s. Really enjoyed the tour. Informative guides, really interesting facts about the street and Dublin in general We spent a pleasurable hour and a half on Tour with Gus!! A fountain of knowledge and enthusiasm. Bitter sweet history, brought so many familiar feelings, sights, recognition of my past familys  history and good fortune to have had jobs and careers.  Dublin has a  mixed history of fortunes won and lost.  14 Henrietta Street is a super museum and a must see, especially for the Irish, not just Dubliners!! This is a hidden gem in Dublin. The guided tour takes you around this house doing a wonderful job to portray how a bourgeois-made house was transformed to housing appartements for the poor living in squalor. Its one of the best museums i have ever visited (and i have visited a lot). Dont miss it, it will worth your time. One of the best tours Ive been in Dublin!!! Impressive work is done here to preserve history, the good and beautiful but also the bad and ugly. Very important. The stuff is great. The tour guide is very very good, he spoke in a very passionate way, you can feel he is involved in the preservation work and that he cares about what he is talking! Pat provided an excellent tour filled with insightful information on the history and daily lives of the residents in this area. It was especially meaningful for me as my grandparents were raised in this community, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of their past experiences. 10/10 Such a wonderful insight into the world of one building. From opulent beginning to over crowded tenement. We had a passionate guide, Jillian, that kept us enthralled & entertained. Very emotive too, well worth a visit. I had visited Dublin before but had never visited this museum / building. From the 3 days sight seeing in the city this was the highlight of the trip. Our guide was amazing, she had a wealth of experience and a passion for the place. This was more than a job to her ( sadly I have forgotten her name but I think it began with a G), many stories (good and bad), the group were captivated, I felt myself fighting back the tears on numerous occasions. This is an amazing experience. A must-do. Very well explained and portrayed. Gillian, our guide, was informed and engaging. Would highly recommend this visit, its another world wonder This is one of the most brilliant historical tours Ive ever done.  Our guide could not have done more to bring history to life. She was amazing.  Be warned,  its a very moving experience - I was moved to tears more than once.   Fantastic. Fabulous. Absolutely wonderful tour of an incredible building. Funny, emotional, entertaining and absolutely fascinating. Pat is a lovely man and an excellent guide. We ll be sure to always recommend a visit to people on our own walking tours! Youll never understand poverty until you see it displayed in front of you like you can experience in this very special museum. Brilliant tour of a building that s both been built and lived in by a General & Marquis in the 1700 d and then latterly a literal Victorian slum and then survived all the way through into the 1970s as a packed tenement building. Highlight of our trip to Dublin. Great guide and very well done films in each room.'"
