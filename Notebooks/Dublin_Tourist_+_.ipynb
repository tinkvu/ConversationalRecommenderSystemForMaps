Coffee was lovely & staff were friendly. Will definitely visit again. I visited with a friend and we were able to sit for ages chatting. Great little breakfast spot with good specialty coffee! There was a constant loud hammering sound from the back during my visit, so had to take a star off for that but otherwise a wonderful experience! Food Two Pups is by far the best of a great selection of cafes and coffee places in Dublin. The coffee is always perfectly made by the best baristas, the pastries and snacks are gorgeous, and the dishes are all absolutely delicious and you can tell they re made with the best possible ingredients. I ve been coming here for years and I just never get sick of it. Special shoutout to Finnuala who always looks after me and she is just the best! My favourite cafe in Dublin. There are some amazing coffee/lunch/brunch options in Dublin, and especially around Dublin 8. But the atmosphere and the staff make this place stand out for me. Friendly and chill. The coffee is taken seriously, prepared to an extremely high standard, above and beyond most cafes. No syrups here. The menu is small, elegant and frankly superb. Fresh, high-quality ingredients and it shows. If you are nearby you should try. Kid-friendliness: No high chairs, it gets quite busy at lunchtimes and weekends Lovely spot with so much seating available. Very tasty, quality food. We ordered the Mexican eggs and the breakfast bap. Wow! Everything was so fresh and tasty. Coffee was beautiful too Food : 5/5 I recently visited Two Pups Coffee, and it was a delightful experience. The cappuccino was hot and frothy, exactly how a good cappuccino should be. The highlight of my visit, however, was the sausage rolls. They were absolutely delicious. The sausage roll had a nice flavor to it, thanks to the addition of some black pudding wrapped with the sausage. The dough was crisp and flaky, making each bite a perfect blend of textures and flavors. In addition to the great food and coffee, the service was exceptional. A friendly red-headed woman greeted me warmly and made sure I was able to carry my takeaway without any issues. Her kindness and attentiveness added a personal touch to my visit, making it even more enjoyable. Overall, Two Pups Coffee is well worth a visit for anyone looking to enjoy quality coffee and tasty treats. This Irish cafe has certainly earned a spot on my list of favorites. Great spot for breakfast. Tasty menu options with high quality ingredients, cute and comfortable ambience and super friendly staff. Hands down my favorite brunch place in Dublin! The staff is always so lovely, the food is amazing, there s always a bit of a wait but I genuinely love going there so much. Definitely the place to be! This place is great! The flat white was delicious and the orange cake was tasty as well. Nice place to relax and have a cup of coffee. Unreal spot for coffee and pastries! Apparently the brunch is really good as well but we didn t try it. Everything was delicious. Staff was very nice and they did everything to accommodate us on a very busy day. Cute atmosphere! Food : 5/5 Got the potato hash for brunch. Absolutely Divine. Everything else looked fab too. Great delicious and pretty reasonable prices. Big inside the cafe which I didn t expect! Staff are lovely and it s cute inside. Definitely recommend checking this place out Vegetarian options: Absolutely fantastic Absolutely feel in love with this place from the moment we walked in and they were playing Aint It Fun by Paramore, I knew we were in the right place. Staff are so welcoming and friendly, and the food in is incredible. So fresh and tasty, and did I mention the hot sauce? Big fan and brought my own bottle to take home. We will be back, with love from your Welsh fans We chose this place because theyre dog-friendly. Lots of seating available and their staff are friendly. Their menu is small which is great because you know then that everything is cooked fresh. I had egg on toast and it was so tasty and full of flavour. The one disappointment that I had is that they dont serve pup cups which would really be a nice touch. Otherwise they are a lovely place for a bite to eat. Really cute little cafe in the Liberties! Menu didn t have as many options for vegetarian as I original thought - but I realised this place has a regularly changing menu with lots of different options, so would be interested in coming back again! My drink was also very nice! You have to way outside to be seated, fortunately we didn t have ti wait for more than 5 . The service is really polite and welcoming. I loved my choice, found the taste really interesting. The hot chocolate was okay. Nice atmosphere. A bit overpriced but that s how things seem to be in Dublin. Would go again If visiting Dublin. Lovely brunch spot, food is always amazing and the people are lovely! Definitely one of the best cafes in Dublin Nice hipster vibe. Very good food and excellent coffee: priced not cheap, but similar to other places in Dublin. Servers are great! However, management made the odd decision of giving half-arsed service: you get food at the table; you get water to your table; tables are cleared; but you CANNOT place an order from the comfort of your dining. Meaning, you place it at the till, and pay before receiving food or beverages (?!). Odd approach, to say the least... Two Pups is a great cafe. The staff makes you feel welcome when you arrive, and the cafe s atmosphere is relaxing and laid back. The coffee is fantastic and served at a good price, along with plenty of great food and take away options. Two Pups is a cafe I go to at least three times a week, usually more. It s a great cafe in Dublin and definitely worth a visit for both locals and tourists alike. Really good food, there is usually a queue outside. You pay at the desk. Recommend the potatoes & eggs is really nice morning meal, feel healthy. Right amount of good you would expect. Coffee is relatively good as well. Service is good. We mentioned we want the eggs running and it was perfectly cooked. We love this place and will come back. Almost once every 2-3 weeks Food was good if pricey. Probably no worse than most places for brunch these days though!The classic avocado on toast was good and the coffee was lovely. The star were the garlic potatoes with a lemon butter, delicious. No table service, order at the till. AMAZING PLACE! I had my breakfast here and I m in LOVE. Super friendly and welcoming staff, delicious food. The croissants dough is extremely delicate but so flavorful, milk and orange juice are spectacular. Calm and relaxing environment. 100% recommended. It was pretty, authentic, just YUM! There was a queue at the time we reached. 15 minutes later, we were able to go in. The place is mediocre, a bit old, and a bit expensive honestly. But maybe these prices are normal in Dublin. However, the food was pretty looking and tasty. You have to order your food at the counter and they will bring it to you. Service is ok, everyone looks positive but no one helps you to make choices if it s your first time. The cookies and cakes were tasty as well! Definitely recommend! Delicious meal and friendly service! Seating line moved quickly. Great cafe based in the Liberties. As the name suggest they are dog friendly which is a big plus as we had our dog with us at the time. We came here for an after lunch snack and had the peanut butter on toast and a raspberry, coconut and dark chocolate cake which were great. We would definitely come back to try the breakfast/brunch/lunch menu. The chai latte and filter coffee are also fantastic. Very good and welcoming service with a chill/relaxed vibe. Referred here from our hotel. Neat place with a cool vibe. Food was really good. One of the best cafes and brunch spots in Dublin. The coffee is perfect. The kitchen goes that extra mile to make brunch a real treat. Amazing cakes. The staff are so friendly and fun. Staff stay a long time which says a lot about the management. There is a genuinely friendly atmosphere. Superb spot for brunch. Dont let the line out the door discourage you, the place is bigger than it looks and they turn over tables quickly. The seasonal hash with black pudding was outstanding, but everything was good. Highly recommend. Vegetarian options: Many vegetarian options, very few vegan. Had the french toast and my goodness was incredible, great mix of savoury and sweet and fixed the hangover perfectly, nice coffee too Excellent excellent food and coffee!! Service was 11/10- would absolutely recommend for breakfast and/or coffee. Had an amazing brunch at this cafe! The ambience is really soothing. They ve good indoor and outdoor seating. Staff is friendly and courteous. The brunch was delicious. The beetroot turkish eggs were delicious and coffees were nice! SO. GOOD. I ordered an oat milk latte (steamed perfectly, not too hot, doesnt taste burnt or flat), along with the eggs & toast + bacon, and a side of garlic potatoes w/ lemon aioli. The toast is thick and crispy, the eggs a lovely medium/mw, perfectly salted, comes with sambal (spicy chili sauce) on the plate if you want to elevate the flavors even more. The potatoes were soft and crispy, the aioli just tangy enough, the plating simple and rustic. Im so happy I stopped here before the Cathedral. Im extremely picky about my lattes and they knocked it out of the park. Service was kind and quick, even sitting in the back courtyard (which felt like a Main Character moment). If I lived here I would be a regular. Vegetarian options: They have a small menu but its varied enough to suit most eaters. Dietary restrictions: They have dairy alternatives for coffee (oat milk steams the best, so thats what I look for) and ask you to divulge allergies when you order. Cute place for coffee or brunch. Has enough tables, so also during the weekend they are able to accommodate you quite quickly if there is a queue. Excellent experience, a cozy cafe that looks small from the outside but big on the inside. Friendly staff and the food is top notch. Fine crafted quality meals! Drinks were amazing as well! But Id like if the Chai tea had a cup handle, was quite hot just holding the glass cup by itself. Other than that, would visit again! Cool spot, queue outside moves quickly and interiors are nice. Order at the counter, and grab your own water etc but asked to tip when paying. Breakfast hash is 10 baby potatoes, some salad and two eggs for  16 - when asked if you want to add any sausages/bacon when ordering say yes or you ll be underwhelmed. Food : 2/5 Great food and coffee in a lovely setting. Definitely worth a visit. Its walk-in only, but the queue moves fairly quickly. Weve been the last 2 weeks and have waited about 20 mins both times. Love that its walk-in only when its so hard to get into other Dublin cafes without a reservation. There were 3 of us and we all loved our dishes - savoury French toast, Avo eggs and Turkish beetroot eggs. The mini brownies are very good too.  Highly recommend. Well be back! If we had one small criticism, it would be the price of the sides. Theyre a bit overpriced. Parking: Free on-street parking nearby, as well as paid options. Absolute hidden gem! Im convinced that no one does brunch like local shops. Two Pups reminds of the college that I attended university, earthy crunchy, young, upbeat, sustainable, rustic, and cozy! The staff goes above and beyond to be friendly, and the food is super creative. Its no longer on the menu, but their eggplant with fried hardboiled egg (yes, you heard that right) was spectacular! Be sure to try their Vietnamese Ice Coffee! ALSO they have more seating in the back/side, more than you think/can see from the outside (theres also an outdoor patio in the back)! I just really wish they were open more days of the week. Staff was so friendly, food was excellent. I ate the sandwich with meatballs which was delicious and huge. My friend took croissant, it was fresh and delicious too. Browni is worth to try! Last but not least coffee was professional and delicious: Big thanks to awesome barista. Outside sitting available. For sure, I will return back. Thanks for nice experience. Lovely spot with great and friendly service. Definitely a good spot for brunch and has a tempting selection of treats to finish. The breakfast bap was particularly tasty! Food is absolutely delicious. I have to confess I hardly empty my plate, and today I finished it. I had the beetroot salad, absolutely gorgeous. Tasty, light, thoroughly made to perfection. Staff is very friendly and the place has a different and special atmosphere. Definitely recommend it. Wonderful staff. Great coffee. The brunch seemed a bit pricey but the food was good nevertheless. Had a bit of a suggestion with the Green Shakshuka, the eggs are supposed to be runny and not completely fried and that s the essence of an authentic shakshuka. Apart from this all the food was great, coffee was excellent and loved the Lemon sponge slice\",\n          \"A popular little square with seating and grassed areas. Theres a cafe in an old tram in the square. Good location to take a break and its close to many of Dublins large shopping centres. Was on a singing walking tour. Nice atmosphere. Coffee and snack hut in a converted tram car. Very urban but a nice place to sit and opt out of the hustle and bustle from the many shops nearby. Well kept little park beside Jervis shopping centre. Nice coffee shop there too. The Tram. The area in some parts   is under a  construction upgrade not sure exactly but it will be finished soon . The is a lovely cafe The Tram which is selling take away fine coffee and tasty food and snacks . There is public toilets with mobility access thats open 7 days a week 10am to 8pm . its spotless , there is security and cleaners on site during opening hours . Big old trees line the sides and solid benches , and old headstones lying on the walled side . its just perfect for welfare break , nice coffee and a tinkle if needed. its very well maintained . Great outdoor place to sit in the city center,  it had the tram cafe and a free seating around it. There is a public toilet as well and all at ground level.  There are usually a lot of people here and also birds/seagulls around waiting to get a bit so not the best place to have a relaxing lunch. There are no shelter for rain and no place for parking but overall a great park in busy city It is difficult to decide how many stars to award as it has been redeveloped a green  public space but as they are waiting for the trees and plants to settle in there is no public access except to the Tram Cafe. It the past I would have liked it except for the fact that it was a magnet for anti-social behaviour. I will give it three stars with a possibility of upgrading to four or five at a later date depending on how well it is managed. Litterally full of addicts and alcoholics that I witnessed on two occasions fighting like something out of homeless Tekken. Then one of the other undesirables set alight to someones shoes and nearly lit the entire park on fire The only place in city that DC set up toilets. Very well maned and very clean and also could have cup of coffee from the tram sitting on bench A nice spot to relax and take the air close to the bustle of Henry St Enough space to sit and eat outside at the heart of Dublin city centre. Great place for selfies for tourist Interesting little spot in the city that stands out from its surroundings. The Tram cafe livens it up a bit but it can look dicey after hours. Thats fine! Lovely place for drink coffee on saturday afternoon with your friends. Location in the city center Nice stopping point at Tram Cafe there. Plus. Public Toilets now there as well. Look up pictures of what it looked like before 2001. Its insane what theyve done to it, even recently the grass was removed for that beige gravel. Insane Great spot just be careful you dont trip over a junkie.... Bekind Theres always something on there! Great location to wait for a friend. There is a Dublin bikes station. Very good coffee from a pleasant and polite barista The Tram cafe has a very friendly staff. Love this tram cafe. Coffee and ice cream is lovely I miss the cow    but nice relax place Really nicely kept, lovely space to read a book in good weather This is a small park at the top of Henry Street. A place to relax and have a bite to eat, local food Very nice public space It was a great experience and amazing place, must go Great food great service Wonderful coffee They are the slowest park builders in the world Fantastic beautiful peaceful The people around and this area dirty, dangerous Beautiful place and beautiful people. Love this Ok Like it Historical site Full of junkies Love Der Park ist ganz nett, allerdings sehr viele komische Leute hier, Alkoholiker, Suchtige etc... , parco piccolo ma molto comodo e carino.\",\n          \"I was very pleasantly surprised by the interior of the house, its preservation, original furniture... Looking around the whole house seemed to bring me back to the life of O Wilde and his family. The house is toured independently, you can stay as long as you want. At the end, a film about Wildes life is shown and the film leaves a very deep impression. I recommend the tour! too disappointed, the old rooms are transformed into classrooms, the rooms are empty. The information we are given is minimal and not very interesting. Some rooms are very beautiful (like the library) and make up for the visit a little. I dont recommend it if you have little time in Dublin. Lovely place to visit, and get a bit of the story behind Oscar Wilde - specially about his parents, strong characters of Dublin life. The house is beautiful, and if you have the chance, don t miss the guided tour on Saturdays. But the self-guided tour is also great, super recommended. Sadly no current access, due to the students  exam times, but just being at this building of one of the greatest literary giants is humbling enough. What a tragic and beautiful story, passionately narrated by Martin! I really enjoyed the guided tour of the house where Oscar Wilde grew up and spent many years of his life. Some of the original belongings of the Wilde family are still in place (ie: a collection of books by Oscar and his parents, the Irish oak floorboards, neo-classical reliefs decorating the walls,and coloured windows). It is a different house visit compared to the norm - Oscar s family had to sell the house a long time ago, because despite the success Oscar s father ended up in misery (as well as Oscar himself). The building is now home of the American College Dublin, with the guided tours about Oscar s life being managed by a registered charity. The funds raised from the house visits are used to cover the house restauration expenses. I would definitely recommend the visit, the house is still a precious testimony of his life and also the director is so engaging in telling the family anecdotes besides having a wealth of knowledge on Oscar Wilde s incredible life. Really interesting tour, highly interesting to anyone who likes Wilde. There is not much to see at the house itself, but the tour was 100% worth it. Visited on This was the Wilde family home where Oscar Wilde lived from infancy before moving to England - 1855 to 1878. It is now occupied by the American College in Dublin. Unfortunately when I was there us was closed so I wasn t able to go inside but I still took pictures from the outside and then visited his memorial statue across the street in the park. No-one can get inside, it is a private college. You see the house only from outside. You can have a look at the beautiful park at the other side and visit the statue. Historic house where Oscar Wilde lived from 1855 to 1878 House in great shape, a must see for Wilde fans, and those who do not know him! A wonderful experience.  If you want to know more about Dublin History you must visit.  The Wilde family where a big part of it. A famous Writer with equity famous parents. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde I would absolutely reccomend this museum. It gives you a good sense of his heritage and his familys wealth without having to read an entire biography. The uses of each room are well documented so if you want to you can try and summon his ghost (I was unfortunately unsuccessful). Furthermore I also tremendously enjoyed the architectural aspects of the house which is just a small nice thing on top. However, if youve just heard of him its probably not worth the money though and youd be better off taking a picture with his statue just across the street in the park. It closed during the winter season.  You can see a monument of Oscar in the park just across the street. As an avid Oscar Wilde fan, I was hoping to see more than just the outside! Tours not available because American College apparently uses the space. Be sure to check out the memorial in the park, just across the street. Absolutely my favourite place in Dublin. Thank you so much to the girl where we bought the entrance tickets. Best regards Padua Italy What can i say, its Oscar Wildes house!! OMFG! And he has an action figure!! Visited on Famous place at Merrion Square, with Oscar Wilde monument just opposite in the park. Nicely kept and attractive place that was the center of intelectual and social life at the end of 19th century. A short film can be seen about the Wilde family, very interesting. Very nice and friendly gentleman selling tickets. I bought (again) a booklet of short stories. Heartily recommended during visit to Dublin. Brillant if you book the tour. The guide tells with passion and knowledge the story of the wild family and the house. Without the guide and from the outside theres not much too it. Unfortunately the house cannot be visited, there is an American educational institution in it, but from the outside one gets a feeling for the Victorian Dublin with a little imagination. Amazing experience, loved learning more about the Wilde family! Went to the tour recently and really enjoyed it. The guide was so good, really entertaining and an absolute mine of information on not just Oscar but the whole Wilde family. After the talk we had the opportunity to wander around the house which was terrific and gave a real tangible link to the lives that had been lived there. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone tourist or a local alike,so Interesting and entertaining like stepping back in time. As a museum, this is a big disappointment. Yes, Oscar Wilde lived here as a child but there is not much left to see from that time. In fact there is not much to see at all except bare rooms where the paint is peeling from the walls and ceiling. The museum doesnt tell you very much about Oscar either, all the more about his parents. The entrance fee is said to go to the house restoration fund, so in that way visiting the museum can be a charity. But the restoration supposedly started in the mid-90s and still it doesnt look like much has happened. If youre a hardcore fan of Oscar youll probably want to visit the house regardless, but otherwise there are better ways to get to know Oscar Wilde. If you really want to go, make sure to take a guided tour. Then you might get a little more out of the visit than I did. An interesting and historical place to visit, but there isnt much else than seeing the side of the building. The pictures are basically it. Only open for tours on Sundays at 2, but still cool to see! I went to visit this museum for the first time today (15-08-2022). Its a very interesting museum. This is where the famous Irish poet and playwright Oscar Wilde used to live as a kid. In the end of July 2022, I was going to visit the museum but unfortunately it was already closed for full guide tour. I knew it was very disappointing but its all forgotten now so theres nothing to worry about it. I was glad to visit this museum again. Anyway Id like to visit this museum again someday. If you have the same guide we had, you will have a fantastic experience. A journey through the life and times of the wonderful Oscar Wilde and his legacy to the world. no furniture in the bedrooms, but other than that very cosy visit! friendly and funny staff, has a short informative movie running and good merch! Despite my curiosity and interest in the life and works of Oscar Wilde, attending the conference on his life and family at this place that was previously his home was a frustrating experience for me. Listening for more than an hour to a speaker speaking in non-inclusive English.. that is to say quickly and without pauses.. understandable only to those who master the English language in this way has become heavy and tiring for me . What a pity :) If it had at least written support... or if at least the video had English subtitles... it would have been a little more open for foreign tourists who sometimes have difficulty following the accents + the speed of the speeches . I have participated in other tourism activities in Ireland and other English-speaking countries where the presenters understood that English is not the language spoken in every country every day. Even when we try. If we take the plane and pay for tickets to see another culture... its because we are curious. And it would be great to see that there are people who want to communicate with us too. We booked a visit on the last day of the Literature Festival, and even though my wife and I were exhausted after a transatlantic flight and a strenuous bicycle ride, we were not disappointed. Getting to know about the Wilde family history and stories in the house he grew up was fascinating. Highly recommended. We were able to visit this house but frankly for the price of 10 euros, there is not much to see. The decoration and furniture are quite pretty but the paper posters taped to the walls do not have a nice effect. Its a good deed to pay, thats all. Wonderful tour of Wildes childhood home, with a fascinating talk about his family, life, writing - and downfall. Captivating, loved the chance to walk through this beautiful house. The oscar wilde house is not about oscar wilde. It is about the house and family. This is in essence not a problem, but the information given is limited and is mostly about his brother. The information is not in depth, but only about the affairs the brother had and the mistakes he mad. The things they say about oscar are simple things like when he went to college and what he liked and did not like. Would not reccomend Thoroughly enjoyed the tour of Oscar Wildes house under the guidance of Martin Burns who is a well- informed natural raconteur. Highly recommended! Nice entrance from the outside, but you wont see much more as there are no visitors allowed. It is a small attraction, but the park across the street will greatly add to your experience. In the park is a statue of Oscar Wilde facing his home with pillars of granite in the area with many of his famous quotes. Directly next to him is also a small plaque at the base of a small tree planted in remembrance of all the LGBTQ+ persons of Ireland lost in the march towards equal rights which is quite touching. Afterwards I would recommended exploring the whole park and all its beauty. Cant go inside because it is a college. Total worth going to see the statue across the way 1. A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal. 2. A man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her. 3. Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much. 4. America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between. 5. Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination. 6. Arguments are to be avoided; they are always vulgar and often convincing. 7. Biography lends to death a new terror. 8. Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months. 9. I am not young enough to know everything. 10. I think that God in creating Man somewhat overestimated his ability. 11. I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and took out a comma. In the afternoon I put it back again. 12. Illusion is the first of all pleasures. 13. It is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so little useless information. 14. Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly uninteresting event. 15. One should always play fairly when one has the winning cards. 16. Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious. 17. Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live. 18. The only thing to do with good advice is pass it on. It is never any use to oneself. 19. The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. 20. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible. Oscar Wildes Statue (not house) I love the statue. It totally captures the subjects personality, in a way that would have probably amused the hell out of Oscar Wilde himself. Nice set up, beautifully framed by a bunch of trees... I didnt went inside but I have seen it from the outside and its beautiful Well, thats definitely a must visit for literature lovers ! So glad I could book the guided  tour before it was sold out\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Its got a really nostalgic feel to it, and the staff is super friendly. I had the tomato soup yesterday and WoW, what a fresh wholesome and amazing homemade soup! Couple that with friendly staff and a lovely vibe and atmosphere and a dedication to good food and service and you have a winner! This White Rabbit is one happy bunny! I visited in November 2023, having a flat white and chocolate cookie. The coffee was well roasted and made. The cookie rich and balanced. Service was warm, friendly and inviting. I would recommend and return. The food here is excellent and Sasha and all the staff are so kind and friendly. Highly recommend. Lovely flat white, friendly service. Great for quick access to museums. Lovely local cafe in centre of city. Food is fresh and prepared on site. Great coffee, value, and the staff were really lovely and friendly. Their pastries and sandwiches are especially tasty. Thanks again for all the information guys! Will be back soon! Great healthy salad options. Vegan/vegetarian friendly. 2 small tables outside Lovely central spot just behind Trinity. As an Italian, I usually struggle to find a good espresso at a reasonable price (mostly in the city centre) but the barista Sasha really blew me away with a lovely italian style macchiato! Food is as fresh as it gets, offer is quite wide (express salads and bowls, sandwiches, soups) I myself had a tuna sandwich and chicken soup, both were absolutely superlative!! Highly recommended, definitely adding this to my list of favourites! Lovely cafe with the most friendly staff! Highly recommend Definitely a favourite! Food Its on my way to office so thought of getting a latte, the lady barista made this art in everyone s coffee, i was looking forward to be having same experience, but alas when it came to me she was so done , and handed the coffee not even polite there you go, no art in coffee nothing. I wanted to give her benefit of doubt and went back next day, same behaviour, the only difference b/w me and other ppl was my color . Shame of the barista! If it was indeed intentional its sad. Never went back again. Petit Cafe is much better , i would recommend that Just paid EUR3.50 for a croissant so old, even ripping it apart to toast it to get some freshness back into it, didnt help. Ive walked past here 1000 times, always wanting to go in because it seems really cosy and popular. So disappointed and will not be visiting again. Best chai latte of my life. My friend described the flat white as  average . Salad was good. Customer service was mediocre along with toasty sandwich. Our table was not cleaned after previous customers. Also, the seating was uncomfortable and the pillows looked very dirty (crumbs etc.). Would return for the chai and the nice vibes, however. Nice little cafe with friendly staff and comfortable feel. I absolutely love this cafe, always come in for a flat white and toastie, and both never fail me. The affordable prices, which are hard to come across in town nowadays, and the kind and welcoming staff makes this cafe one of my favourites! Really disappointed. I always went for the food not the service. This is why I won t be back. Today I went in & took my place in the queue of two others. Premises were empty, no bums in seats. Lady at the till chatting away with a friend while I m waiting,  she decided to tell me she had not seen her friend in ages, & continues to chat. Ok. I step back & he apologizes for delaying me. This happens twice..! Since when is a chat with a friend (who should take a seat or come back) take the place of a polite but also paying customer. It s lunch time, Iv politely waited & now I m just being ignored, while the chat continues!!! This is not the first time either. Bad service is the death of most businesses. Sadly, Really bad customer service. Don t waste your time going. Really nice to see somewhere in Dublin with good food at reasonable prices. Our whole office can been seen here at lunch time for the take away soup and sandwich. Staff are always nice, (I think Gabriella) is always super friendly and knows most regulars orders off by heart. Keep meaning to pop in for a glass of wine in the evening! Amazing food! Soup was absolutely lovely  . BEST COFFEE IN DUBLIN!!! And all the staff were amazing and so kind and a lovely atmosphere! Will vist again! <333 Food It is a shame that there are no zero stars to rate this cafe . After 15 minutes from ordering i was approached by a staff member asking me if I would like to order something else, otherwise I have to leave as it is lunch time 1:00 pm and they will be expecting customers . I have never encountered such rudeness in my life. will never return to this place.  for the fellow customers, beware, to finish  quickly around lunch time or else you have to vacate. This cafe was really nice and the staff were lovely, but I was very put off by hearing the owner/manager (unsure) talking down to his staff. He was quite loudly being hostile and demeaning to the women working there with him, and listening made me very uncomfortable. I hope this can change. Fantastic!  quality of food and exceptional service. What a coffee! Lovely place and also the baristas were amazing, and so kind with us, obviously I ll come back. Overheard manager/boss demeaning and being really condescending to female barista. Barista was lovely and should not have been treated like that. Not impressed with the misogyny with my coffee. Hopefully manager starts treating his staff with the respect they deserve. The prepared sandwiches were tasty and well crafted, I loved them. Also nice service! Will definitely go back when in the area. Lovely little spot for some soup or a sandwich. Service with a smile and some great outdoor seating. Soup was excellent and could have had another. Great little coffee shop in Dublin! Stopped in for a smoked salmon sandwich and a latte. Both were so delicious!! The best latte I ve had in Dublin. Visually appealing presentation, classy cup, and complex coffee flavor. A couple of delicious chaos and a Danish roll were delicious at this cute cafe! Loved this place, the staff and the atmospher. The food was amazing. Really handy for popping in and picking up a pre-made sandwich, and the ones ive had are all tasty and fresh. Good coffee too. Toasties are amazing,  I recommend the one with pesto and veggies, delicious. I like it here cafe is alright staff are very friendly and welcoming service at times is slow but great location for pearse station food is average. Beautiful coffee and most pleasant staff. Love to visit again sometime. This is a hidden gem for a great lunch. Toasties are delicious with the chunky soup. Great, friendly staff too. Wrap was good quality and reasonably priced but they took 16 minutes to toast it, and there was only one other customer there, was a bit bizarre Affordable, for Dublin, quick, super tasty, great staff. Excellent vegan wrap and lovely staff, would highly recommend Amazing toasted sambos & soups . Super quick service and friendly staff. Cant find better value for money Great salad!! I m sure the rest of the food is great as well Absolutely delicious sandwiches and wraps, so so yummy! Lovely break from bustle on Nassau Street. Attentive staff, quiet spot for a conversation.\",\n          \"Nice use of a small space. Really affordable and good portion sizes. Coffee tasted a bit peculiar but overall a really nice cafe. Coffee is delish! Food amazing and good location 2 min walk from Connolly train station .. can t wait to go back! Found this place walking with a friend, we saw a line in this small corner close to the city center and I think  this place must be good  and what a surprise. I ask the cashier for her recommendation - the three cheese sandwich- made with rustic bread and a dry tomato sauce, AMAZING!!! The quality of the service was lovely too, I ll recommend everyone that it s looking for something fast and delicious to give them a chance, I m definitely coming back to taste the rest of the menu. 10/10 It s became my luck spot before class, the mushroom sandwich my absolute fave and lemon and mint tea mix to die for. Obsessed! Finally big portions low price. Everything was delicious and really enjoyed the sun I found this spot while planning for holiday as it was near our hotel. All the photos we saw made us excited for our visit for over 4 months. The wait was WORTH IT! The Breakfast Sambo was by far the best breakfast I had while in Ireland. The employees were all so kind and sincere, this is by far the place I will be recommending to anyone I know that is traveling to Dublin. Very delicious breakfast with coffee in Dublin 1. Perfect way to start the day. Cozy little place with a lovely atmosphere. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and Food was delicious and served quickly. All menu items are well priced. Amazing breakfast! Really tasty great portion! #Supportlocal Great place Bagel with salmon so delicious Food Nice coffee. Customer disservice. Not sure they collectively could be more up themselves, rude or possibly hungover. Get some new staff. Nice looking place . Id like to share my experience at this cafe. The coffee they serve is truly excellent and of high quality, which is definitely a plus. However, Im saddened to say that the customer service leaves much to be desired. On several occasions, Ive noticed that the staff seem to be in a bad mood and are rude in their demeanor. Often, they dont respond when I thank them or even when I simply greet them upon entering. While Ive been a repeat customer at this cafe, I no longer feel comfortable patronizing it due to the consistent negative interactions with the staff. Improving the attitude and courtesy towards customers would greatly enhance the overall experience and encourage customer loyalty. Great coffee. Lovely aesthetic. Wifi didn t work. Couldn t find the network and when it finally showed up, the password didn t work. The people working weren t helpful either. I was looking forward to spending time here to get some work done but had to slam my coffee down and find a different spot. Would recommend this place 10/10 if you don t need wifi. Cafe accross this fantastic place for morning coffee. Enjoyed Hot chocolate. Definitely worth giving a try  . The most aesthetic place in town to start your early morning with. Always new items in menu; Great breakfast / lunch offers; Vegan/Vegetarian options are included; Coffee of a very higher standard; And, yes, the stuff is as good as flat white with brownie. Will recommend this place to everyone, who s having some time on Monday - Friday: 7:30am - 3:00pm. During the lunch hours place is usually super busy, but you can always get a take away! Delicious little spot   had an americano and granola to go. Both absolutely spot on in terms of flavour and presentation too! Weekly visit. Simple and tasty. Amazing soup and best mushroom toast EVER! This was one of the nicer surprises in Dublin so far - went in by the recommendation of the Indy Coffee Guide, and planned to get just coffee and toast. I ended up returning the following morning for breakfast as well. The coffee was not exceptional but well above average, and (quite surprisingly) not overextracted. Food exceeded my expectations in any realm - toasties were crispy and flavorful and croissants had close to perfect lamination. Definitely worth it for a casual breakfast and a chat with very courteous staff. Beautiful coffee shop with amazing food. I had one of the best salads I ve ever had here. Stayed in Dublin for two days and came here on both mornings. So awesome! Delicious breakfast menu and coffee. Good value for money! Friendly staff Good place to grab a coffee. They have a good selection of tasty sandwiches and the staff is super friendly. Chirpy little independent coffee shop selling good selection of breakfasts. They have made the best of their narrow floor space and provided good seating area for groups and solo patrons. The food was good and priced very competitively for Dublin City centre ( 10 for large Irish breakfast and coffee). Whilst there isn t any Wi-Fi, this doesn t seem to be an issue for the majority of people. The coffee was sadly of very average quality. Highly recommended good place for breakfast and price is fair enough Really nice place, bright and theres a good few seats if you dont mind sharing big tables with other people. The staff were really friendly and the coffee is good This cafe is really lovely Quite cheap and great quality coffee It s rather busy during lunch time so you may find it hard to find a seat inside! Overpriced! 8  for a chicken sandwich (chicken leaves and mayo). The bread was nice, but the sandwich was nothing special... The cashier was very fed up. An Overal score of 3 stars, the sandwich did the job. That was all. Delicious pumpkin latte, excellent customer service and great (creative) cakes! They ve even got the pastries halloween-themed! Very good food, lovely atmosphere Fantastic coffee and baked goods. Was reasonably priced and very friendly staff. Would definitely come back! Just had the most gorgeous Avocado on sourdough for breakfast. Absolutely delicious. This is a little gem of a spot. Its a shame that the service is so unpleasant . They receive you with a bad attitude, a bad face, they do not bring service with a good attitude. I have attended and filled out more than 3 loyalty cards in these months because the location is too comfortable for me and the food is quite good. The five young women who work here have a lousy attitude. Disappointing. We found this place with a friend during our stay. During the 4 days we were there, we had our breakfasts there. Cookie, banana bread, porridge, granola, avocado toast, scrambled eggs, bagel, we loved it all. Portion more than correct. In terms of drinks, we only tasted the hot chocolate which was also good. Small place, only a few seats, but I find that that contributes to the charm. Very pleasant and gentle atmosphere. We will definitely return there on our next visits. Coffee is always so good probably my favourite coffee shop in the city Lovely cozy cafe. It s a tiny cafe but the quality of coffee and food is great. Lovely staff also! I enjoyed a large pain au chocolat for  3 here! The soup I got was really gorgeous. However, all the sandwiches were pre-made and had fillings I couldnt eat, like mayo. There were closing while we were in the middle of eating our lunch so I felt rushed to finish and leave. If you could eat what they had on the menu you would probably go back, but I more than likely wouldnt return due to the limited menu Great for a pop-in coffee. Try their three cheese toastie. Hits the spot Lovely creamy coffee. The staff are super nice. Toilet was clean. Got very very busy once 12 hit. There isnt a whole lot of seating. Also, Beware. Their salt dispenser looks like the sugar dispenser. The staff kindly replaced my drink, I think it happens alot. Nice coffee, but the staff are most consistent in their misery, rolling eyes at customers and confrontational at non-issues. You can forgive an isolated rude experience, but its the norm for here. We had breakfast twice at this cute cafe during our stay in Dublin. The coffee was more than decent and I loved their homemade granola with yoghurt and fruit. The almond croissant was also quite good. I was pleasantly surprised with their prices considering the quality and quantity of their food. I really liked the minimalistic design that doesnt sacrifice customers comfort. This would be in my Top 10 for takeaway coffee in Dublin. Whoever the baristas are; they get the mix between coffee richness and smoothness almost perfect! The result is highly palatable cup of joe served up by very affable staff. Highly recommended.\",\n          \"A popular little square with seating and grassed areas. Theres a cafe in an old tram in the square. Good location to take a break and its close to many of Dublins large shopping centres. Was on a singing walking tour. Nice atmosphere. Coffee and snack hut in a converted tram car. Very urban but a nice place to sit and opt out of the hustle and bustle from the many shops nearby. Well kept little park beside Jervis shopping centre. Nice coffee shop there too. The Tram. The area in some parts   is under a  construction upgrade not sure exactly but it will be finished soon . The is a lovely cafe The Tram which is selling take away fine coffee and tasty food and snacks . There is public toilets with mobility access thats open 7 days a week 10am to 8pm . its spotless , there is security and cleaners on site during opening hours . Big old trees line the sides and solid benches , and old headstones lying on the walled side . its just perfect for welfare break , nice coffee and a tinkle if needed. its very well maintained . Great outdoor place to sit in the city center,  it had the tram cafe and a free seating around it. There is a public toilet as well and all at ground level.  There are usually a lot of people here and also birds/seagulls around waiting to get a bit so not the best place to have a relaxing lunch. There are no shelter for rain and no place for parking but overall a great park in busy city It is difficult to decide how many stars to award as it has been redeveloped a green  public space but as they are waiting for the trees and plants to settle in there is no public access except to the Tram Cafe. It the past I would have liked it except for the fact that it was a magnet for anti-social behaviour. I will give it three stars with a possibility of upgrading to four or five at a later date depending on how well it is managed. Litterally full of addicts and alcoholics that I witnessed on two occasions fighting like something out of homeless Tekken. Then one of the other undesirables set alight to someones shoes and nearly lit the entire park on fire The only place in city that DC set up toilets. Very well maned and very clean and also could have cup of coffee from the tram sitting on bench A nice spot to relax and take the air close to the bustle of Henry St Enough space to sit and eat outside at the heart of Dublin city centre. Great place for selfies for tourist Interesting little spot in the city that stands out from its surroundings. The Tram cafe livens it up a bit but it can look dicey after hours. Thats fine! Lovely place for drink coffee on saturday afternoon with your friends. Location in the city center Nice stopping point at Tram Cafe there. Plus. Public Toilets now there as well. Look up pictures of what it looked like before 2001. Its insane what theyve done to it, even recently the grass was removed for that beige gravel. Insane Great spot just be careful you dont trip over a junkie.... Bekind Theres always something on there! Great location to wait for a friend. There is a Dublin bikes station. Very good coffee from a pleasant and polite barista The Tram cafe has a very friendly staff. Love this tram cafe. Coffee and ice cream is lovely I miss the cow    but nice relax place Really nicely kept, lovely space to read a book in good weather This is a small park at the top of Henry Street. A place to relax and have a bite to eat, local food Very nice public space It was a great experience and amazing place, must go Great food great service Wonderful coffee They are the slowest park builders in the world Fantastic beautiful peaceful The people around and this area dirty, dangerous Beautiful place and beautiful people.
