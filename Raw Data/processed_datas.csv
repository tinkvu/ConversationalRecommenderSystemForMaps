0,14 Henrietta Street,4.875,"The museum is very good. I highly recommend it to know more about georgian houses and Dublins life. The experience was overall really good. However, the tour was with a group of 20 people, and the rooms are not big enough to appreciate all with big groups. The museum should consider this. The guide was ok, good information but with no group management at all. He started to talk before the group was inside the room. Ive lost half of the tour because of this. This museum tells an important story about perseverance, community building, social class, and the spirit struggle for social justice in Ireland with lessons all societies. 14 Henrietta invites visitors to look inside this Irish history with empathy and build capacity to confront disparities in any way one can. Excellent tour narrative and engaging use of technology. A must visit for locals and tourists. A real look into tenement life in Dublin and the history on how it started. Lloyd was our guide and was brilliant. He is a local who was born and bread close by which added to the experience hearing the history and stories with a local accent and colloquialisms. We learned so much about the history of Dublin on this guided tour, as it related to the people who lived at this location. It is a gorgeous block, used for many film shoots. You would never believe that thousands of people lived in poverty and squalor in these houses that were once grand but then turned into tenements. The last tenant moving out in 1979!! Great place to visit.  Go back in time to the 1700s  through to the 1970s as your guided through the house.  Great guide, and the buildings rooms help transport you to the lives of people as they lived there.  Go to this place if you have any interest in the history of dublin. This is a great historic overview of Georgian house and it s transformation from a mansion of one wealthy family in the 1700 s to tenement housing for 26 families through to the 1970 s. Gus was our tour guide and he was very knowledgeable and was happy to take questions. This is a must see tour to understand the history of Dublin. Give yourself and hour and a half for the tour. 14 Henrietta Street is a must-see in Dublin! It gives you a look into the reality of the tenement life. Our guide was knowledgeable and passionate. The tour was about 75 minutes. myself and my wife brought her parents who are from around that area , we really enjoyed the tour, Gillian was fantastic with her knowledge and strong Dublin accent which made you feel right at home, 100% recommend Booked the tour online. The tour was fantastic. I really enjoyed it. Its lasted well over an hour and a half. For  10 its well worth the visit. Our guide was full of stories. Would highly recommend coming. Wonderful guided tour of an important part of Dublins history, tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and had a deep passion for the stories she told us as we made our way around the building, those involved in preserving the building have done a great job. Great Experience absolutely Worth while. Learned alot about live and the Change from very rich to poor from 18th to 20th century. Multimedia Infos about the families in the actual rooms they lived in. Presented to small groups with room for Personal questions. I got a voucher for this just before covid. I honestly thought it would be gone out of date but the amazing staff at 14 Henrietta Street emailed to say it was still valid and would we like to book. I was honestly blown away by their kindness. We went on Sunday and from the moment we opened that very large door (!) we were met with such a welcome and warmth. Gus was our guide and he was so informative and funny. He can answer any questions so tap into his knowledge. I loved every minute Very impressive and I really stepped back in time to the Dublin tenement days! Great guide and knowledge. Well worth a visit and only sorry I never visited sooner. A very interesting museum in Dublin. Building was constructed for a wealthy family. Eventually it was subdivided into small apartments. Toward the end it was a tenement building. it was a wonderful experience learning about how housing policy in dublin changed throughout the years and the sharp contrast between the rich and the poor. highly recommend! Brilliant 1.5 hour tour of tenement life in Dublin. Jill the tour guide (I think that was her name) was amazing; so informative and passionate. She had family connections to the buildings as well as being from Dublin, therefore her accounts of the ordinary people of Dublin really brought things to life and into perspective. A real eye opener and so thought provoking. A must do for anyone visiting Dublin. You do need to book a few days before attending. For anyone interested in the social history of Dublin, this muses is an absolute must. The tour is exceptionally well organised and the guides(we had Pat, he was brilliant) are so knowledgeable and approachable. They make the awful story of Dublins tenements come to life. Absolutely brilliant museum very interesting. Well worth the 1.30 hr tour. Our guide gave us a great experience going back in time when they were first built and all the different time periods and what they were used for and how people lived. A great bit of Irish history. Id recommend this museum to anyone who is thinking of a visit. Great tour, and museum. Our guide Declan was excellent. There is a guided tour and several informative videos. An absolutely fascinating experience. Gillian was so passionate throughout the tour & you could really tell she cares about what shes talking about. She was a fountain of knowledge & could answer any and all questions about the building. A fantastic experience & I recommend it to anyone, especially Dublin locals, its surprising what you might not know about your own city! Fantastic immersive tour and cheap as chips too! Great way to spend an hour and 30 minutes. Tour guides are very knowledgeable, funny and entertaining in general. You get a great sense of what city living was like in Dublin from the late 1700s through to the Mid 1900s.  Fascinating that some people who lived in the residence are still alive and donated their experience and family memorabilia to the museum. Definitely a tour to take in Dublin. I enjoyed a hugely positive experience at 14 Henrietta Street. Its a wonderful place to visit. Our guide, Gillian, was fabulous and hugely knowledgeable, answering every question and expanding on them with extra information. I went with a work group, all of whom enjoyed it. I plan to return again and share the experience with friends and family. Would highly recommend 14 Henrietta street. Our tour guide Pat was brilliant. The tour take around 75-90 minutes. You walk through a house of history that takes you back 300 years. There s a tour every hour on the hour. If you re in Dublin,I would definitely recommend booking this experience. The tour moves through the history of the house from Georgian mansion housing one family to a tenement building housing up to 17 families. The stark contrast of these two periods is wonderfully bought together on the tour.  Our guide Declan had a passion for the house and its history which shone through in his descriptions.  The tour provided a great social history of Dublin.  Would highly recommend. Very interesting to see the history of this house in the original Georgian street in Dublin, from its origin as a residence of one of the most affluent families of the ascendancy to its later phase as a miserable tenement housing 17 families in squalor. It would be even more impressive if the acquired some typical 18th century furniture for at least one of the upper rooms. Strongly recommended. Fantastic tour for anyone interested in the social history of Dublin during the tenement housing situation. Our tour guide Frank was informative and you watch several short films throughout the tour too. There are seats in different rooms, which is good for those who need a rest in between as its a 75 minute tour through different floors. An incredible historical journey through a very interesting and, for me, unknown part of Dublins history. The tour includes very useful audio-visual aids. The guide was kind, clear and really knowledgeable. Not to be missed Captivating tour, you learn a lot of interesting facts about the history of the building (and Dublin also) from the time that was built in 1740 until the last tenants moved out, in the late 1970s. Really enjoyed the tour. Informative guides, really interesting facts about the street and Dublin in general We spent a pleasurable hour and a half on Tour with Gus!! A fountain of knowledge and enthusiasm. Bitter sweet history, brought so many familiar feelings, sights, recognition of my past familys  history and good fortune to have had jobs and careers.  Dublin has a  mixed history of fortunes won and lost.  14 Henrietta Street is a super museum and a must see, especially for the Irish, not just Dubliners!! This is a hidden gem in Dublin. The guided tour takes you around this house doing a wonderful job to portray how a bourgeois-made house was transformed to housing appartements for the poor living in squalor. Its one of the best museums i have ever visited (and i have visited a lot). Dont miss it, it will worth your time. One of the best tours Ive been in Dublin!!! Impressive work is done here to preserve history, the good and beautiful but also the bad and ugly. Very important. The stuff is great. The tour guide is very very good, he spoke in a very passionate way, you can feel he is involved in the preservation work and that he cares about what he is talking! Pat provided an excellent tour filled with insightful information on the history and daily lives of the residents in this area. It was especially meaningful for me as my grandparents were raised in this community, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of their past experiences. 10/10 Such a wonderful insight into the world of one building. From opulent beginning to over crowded tenement. We had a passionate guide, Jillian, that kept us enthralled & entertained. Very emotive too, well worth a visit. I had visited Dublin before but had never visited this museum / building. From the 3 days sight seeing in the city this was the highlight of the trip. Our guide was amazing, she had a wealth of experience and a passion for the place. This was more than a job to her ( sadly I have forgotten her name but I think it began with a G), many stories (good and bad), the group were captivated, I felt myself fighting back the tears on numerous occasions. This is an amazing experience. A must-do. Very well explained and portrayed. Gillian, our guide, was informed and engaging. Would highly recommend this visit, its another world wonder This is one of the most brilliant historical tours Ive ever done.  Our guide could not have done more to bring history to life. She was amazing.  Be warned,  its a very moving experience - I was moved to tears more than once.   Fantastic. Fabulous. Absolutely wonderful tour of an incredible building. Funny, emotional, entertaining and absolutely fascinating. Pat is a lovely man and an excellent guide. We ll be sure to always recommend a visit to people on our own walking tours! Youll never understand poverty until you see it displayed in front of you like you can experience in this very special museum. Brilliant tour of a building that s both been built and lived in by a General & Marquis in the 1700 d and then latterly a literal Victorian slum and then survived all the way through into the 1970s as a packed tenement building. Highlight of our trip to Dublin. Great guide and very well done films in each room."
1,1916 Rebellion Walking Tour,4.975,"Lorcan is a professional guide, passionate about Irish history, an author, factual and engaging. The real deal, a brilliant walking tour all round. Lorcan is a knowledgeable and passionate historian and storyteller. If youve got the time and want to learn a bit about the origins of the Irish Republic while enjoying a walk around Dublin, then you should check out the tour. Youll have a fun and informative time. Cheers! The tour was the highlight of our visit to Dublin. Lorcan s walk is engaging and extremely informative but with humour, expert story telling, and a deeply human approach. I can t recommend it enough - thanks again Lorcan Lorcan was an amazing tour guide and it was a fascinating journey through Irish history. Highly recommended! An absolute must for any visit to Dublin! The passion, attention to detail, total showmanship and care for his audience makes this a once in a lifetime experience! How he engages with his public and manages to wheel out the names and details whilst answering some searching questions is truly amazing. I knew fragments of the story and in a matter of minutes with his typical jovial nature he had filled in the details, debunked some very common myths and gleefully but rightly expressed his frank and funny opinion of some historical figures. If only my history teacher had had 1% of his talent, enthusiasm and social skills, Id be a history graduate today. If you skip this tour, its because youre a total idiot and have missed out on a once in a lifetime experience! Great tour, Lorcan!!!. What else can I say? Highly recommend! Lorcan was entertaining, insightful, and highly informative. I went in knowing very little about the rebellion and left with a deep appreciation for the struggle and sacrifice of many generations of Irish men and women. Lorcan is a fantastic guide and an enormously kind and funny person! Forget about all the tourist busses, if you really want to know about Dublins history from below, there cant be any other choice than him. Thank you for the experience, comrade. Great tour by a world class tour guide! Lorcan kept us enthralled. Told in a witty manner that was easy to understand, I could have listened to him all day. A++ Absolutely brilliant tour. My 3rd time doing it. Highly recommend. I would highly recommend this tour. Lorcan is a brilliant guide, with tonnes of knowledge about Irish history and a great deal of passion for the people and stories he covers in this tour. A brilliant way to understand Dublins history and speak to someone deeply enmeshed in the lore. Lorcan is the man, He is very knowledgable on all things Irish history and has answers for any question you throw at him, can t recommend his tour enough, go raibh mile maith agat Lorcan! Liam was a brilliant tour guide with a great voice so we could hear every word! I was sucked in by the amount of detail that he went into that showed a clear mastery of history. Me and my family were very impressed. This tour is a must if youre interested in the history of Dublin and the Irish rebellion. There was so much information it felt like taking a whole university class in one afternoon! If you love history then this tour is for you. This tour really put some of the fragments of Irish history I learned in grade school together. Lorcan Collins is very knowledgeable and passionate. This is not a light hearted tour as it covers some painful points that are still felt today. Be warned, you may leave this tour with a new found hatred for England. Liam was our guide; friendly & knowledgeable. The tour started rainy but cleared up as we walked.  As a masters student studying women of the revolutionary period I enjoyed seeing the places I have been researching. Liam did a nice job including the women into the narrative. When you finish the tour @ the GPO, it is a short walk to Moore Street to see the end of the story. We loved Lorcans tour as much last week as we did ten years ago when we first took it. Our kids, all in their 20s, were enthralled. This is the real stuff.  Real history, with real emotion, and a Master teacher If youre in Dublin, this is your must-see tour Unreal. Our tour guide was amazing. If you dont already hate the British you will after this and for good reason. I recommend this to anyone your first stop in Dublin  book immediately Lorcan is an unforgettable character.  He was an awesome tour guide and very passionate about the 1916 uprising and Ireland as a whole.  He was very engaging and went out of his way to make a connection with every single person on the tour. Lorcan is a great guide. Very passionate and incredibly knowledgeable. A very amiable chap too. As an Englishman, some of the subject matter was difficult to acknowledge, but its good to be educated sometimes. This tour was a highlight of my trip to Dublin.  If you are a history lover like myself, this is a most do.  The guide was extremely knowledgeable, and very friendly.  The tour starts with a bit of background information at a pub, so grab a Guinness and relax.  Two hours flew by as walked in the footsteps of Irish patriots.  We even had a heckler try to shout about Michael Collins and the IRA, but the guide shooed him  away gracefully.   Awesome tour! Lorcan was an absolute wealth of knowledge, informative, & at times very funny. I would have loved it to be a smaller tour, but had a fantastic experience all the same. Highly recommended, especially if you re lucky enough to have Lorcan as your guide! This was a highlight of our visit. Lorcan is incredibly knowledgeable and provided a really interesting walking tour with a sprinkling of great craic! We ve since recommended to any other tourists we meet and they ve booked on too    Highly recommend! Easily the highlight of the trip, very insightful and great to get some local opinion. Very impressed with Lorcans storytelling, its a must even for those not massively interested in the history of Ireland or politics. Bren and I thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Lorcan, lovely guy and if you like your Irish History he s yer man! Informative, knowledgeable and funny, great time had by all. Lorcan is a passionate and knowledgeable guide! A true Dubliner who lives and breathes the story of the Easter Rising! Havent done the tour but I have bought a couple of badges.Top quality Lorcan is a great guide and he is very knowledgable on the subject matter.  We learned much about the events and people leading up to, and after the Rebellion.  I would highly recommend this tour while in Dublin. AN ABSOLUTE MUST DO, if in Dublin! Lorcan s knowledge, background information, and  Irish wit  makes for a MOST engaging  Rebel History  walk about! I brought 15 members of my family (ages 24-66), with varying levels of interest   - no interest or background in the Rising,  to one diehard with a passionate interest. It rained most of the walk (hey, it is Ireland!), and NO ONE left the group! Lorcan had them almost  hypnotically  fixed on his presentation. All of them said it was WELL WORTH IT, and they said they d definitely do it again! He is a one of a kind kinda of Tour Master! Great tour - Lorcan was passionate, informative, witty & factual and the 2 hours flew by. I knew some of the history from previous times in Dublin, but this really put the pieces together for me - for people interested in Irish history this should not be missed. Terrific tour with a guide who is not simply reading a script but is steeped in the history and street life of Dublin. Lorcan is an excellent storyteller and used 1916 as a pivot to connect Irish (and world) history to contemporary events. Highly recommended. An excellent experience, however I would recommend anyone wishing to take the tour to do a little research in advance. Lorcan obviously lives & breathes Irish history & his enthusiasm knows no bounds. A very pleasant way to increase ones knowledge & if like me, you are a history buff, you wont find a better way to pass a morning. We loved this tour. Lorcan is so knowledgeable and has a great sense of humour. Would definitely recommend if youre in Dublin We had a corporate away day in Dublin so 13 of us did the 1916 walking tour. The guide was great, hugely knowledgeable and the subject matter was interesting even on a fairly miserable day weather wise. They were also kind enough to arrange for 13 plates of excellent Irish stew and Guinness for us all after the tour ended at the International Club which is a great little bar. Lorcan was a knowledgable and charismatic guide with a great sense of humour. Really enjoyed this walking tour! We had an excellent tour with Liam. It is a slowly paced and easy walking tour which gives you a great history of how Ireland has changed politically over the centuries. It clarified many points and was extremely informative. If you like history, its a 10/10! Had an excellent couple of hours with tour guide of the day, Liz Gillis, a local Irish historian. Very lively, very interactive, and very interesting. For any one interested in Irish independence history, i would highly recommend this tour, as it clears away some of the slightly whitewashed history. Very good and detailed tour about the 1916 rebellion.  I cant remember our guides name, but she was very knowledgeable and handled any all questions quite well.  If you want more than just superficial understanding of why 1916 was important for Ireland, this is time well spent.  (Note: the pub we met in beforehand was not the friendliest in Dublin... maybe a little too early in the day.) Lorcin is INCREDIBLE. The tour is great for anyone just getting into Irish history and those of us familiar but desperate for little details. Honestly, I would pay just to have a pint with the man. Hes quick witted and a true professional. Lorcan Collins is a true treasure. Not only does he know everything there is to know about the events that led up to the 1916 Easter Rising, the events of the rising itself, the aftermath, and the Irish struggle for independence, but hes also a master storyteller. This tour should be on everyones must do list when visiting Dublin. Eoin was a great tour guide.   His knowledge and passion for the subject kept all 20 people on the tour interested and entertained.   This was the only tour I did on my short visit to Dublin but I am glad I did. Very interesting historical tour, Lorcans a great guide and has loads of stories just ask away. 5/5"
2,3fe Grand Canal Street,4.7,"Delicious coffee and breakfast in Dublin. Lots of indoor seating available and has pretty fair pricing! We ordered flat whites, eggs on toast, and a tomato mozzarella sandwich. Vegetarian options: Almost half the breakfast menu was vegetarian friendly and they have oat milk available Very good coffee! We had breakfast there, it was very good. The service is fast and friendly. Vegetarian options: A la carte vegetarian dish Enjoyed a delicious latte and breakfast bap after a Sunday morning run. Will definitely be coming back here soon! This is one of the best breakfast places in Dublin. They have the best coffee around and you can t go wrong with their yummy food options. The overall vibes and amazing staff make this my go to place. Go check it out for yourself; you won t regret it! Convenient location and tasty coffee. Always seem busy, but there s one queue for take-away and one for sit-down guests so the wait time is short. Staff is very attentive and efficient. The scone I got on my last visit was the smallest I ve ever seen (half the size of our mugs) and too sweet. I d love a savoury option + a cappuccino for  10 or less. But it s a safe bet if you re going with someone, and the breakfast/lunch dishes are nice. Kudos for perfectly poached eggs! There s a small corner where you can buy stuff for coffee lovers like coffee beans, equipment etc. The  What I Know About Running Coffee Shops  book written by 3fe s owner is more practical and entertaining than many business books so it s worth picking up even if you never plan to open a coffee shop. A lovely place for brunch any day of the week.   The sourdough here was delicious and fluffy, and went well with the hummus. We also had the toast and eggs, which were perfectly poached. The broccoli and almonds was surprisingly good. The flat white and tea were standard, as well as the pain au chocolat. Yogurt bowl was very good. The servers were polite and helpful. I would be happy to return here again in the future Nice cafe with good seating! We sat in the outdoor area and it was lovely on a sunny day! The coffee was excellent - the best thing that we liked there. The pan cakes - were good, a tad bit sweeter for our liking though. The sandwich - was alright with some good fries. The hot sauce chicken - the coating was a tad too thick and oily. Chicken was well cooked and hot sauce was delicious. 3fe Grand Canal Street has been the regular breakfast spot for my wife and me going on 2 years now.  We have - no kidding - been there probably 50+ times. Why do we keep going there?  Is it the food?  Yeah, the food is good, and they have a lot of solid options. Is it the price?  They aren t the cheapest breakfast in town, nor are they the most expensive.  It is a good value for the quality you receive. Is it close to our house?  Yes, but we walk past 2 other breakfast places to get there. Really the secret is the vibe.  The staff are all awesome.  The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.  It just feels really nice to hang out there, eat some good food, drink some great coffee, and talk to some great people. Everything is exceptional! Fantastic food with massive portions, very reasonably priced for the quality and quantities you get. Coffee is the best in Dublin. Super friendly staff. Same quality, service and guaranteed taste over the years. Please never change I m in here a few times a week and it s just the best coffee shop! If you re a coffee lover you have to come here- the standard is just so incredible. The food is delicious- I recommend the fried chicken bap! And last but definitely not least- the staff are unbelievable, always so friendly and up for a bit of banter and always serve up a great coffee! 3fe in Dublin offers a fantastic brunch experience, and their scrambled eggs and pancakes are outstanding. The scrambled eggs are perfectly creamy and seasoned just right, while the pancakes are wonderfully fluffy and come with delicious toppings. The overall quality of ingredients shines through, making the breakfast a true delight. The welcoming atmosphere and attentive service add to the positive experience. 3fe is a go-to spot for a satisfying and delicious brunch in Dublin, where the combination of great food and a trendy yet inviting ambiance make for a memorable dining experience. Best filter coffee in Dublin for coffee enthusiasts. Such a great spot for a brunch or an almond croissant and matcha after Pilates or for a Cinnamon roll and a filter coffee! Staff are so lovely, always bring a good vibe and easy to get a seat! The variety of coffee beans to buy is also always great and if you don t know what you want, you ll always get some help! Great coffee and food. They opened up a few other branches as well but this one is the oldest and my favourite. You can get quality coffee beans here, the staff is generally knowledgeable about all the products though they hire a lot of new people. The coffee was excellent, one of the best we ve tried in Dublin. I even ordered a decaf coffee as well as I cannot have much caffeine The breakfast bap was delicious. I added avocado instead of black pudim. We also ordered an avocado toast with bacon  and was so special with a salty granola. Great spot. Great staff Food is ok but a bit privey, paid 13 euro for the avocado sandwich. Very good coffee! Baristas are good. Too loud for my taste to eat brunch. Avg. 82 db while I was not sitting under a speaker is too much for brunch in my opinion. I was eating at 2 pm. Overall ok experience but nothing special Id recommend having a coffee to go. Great brunch & coffee, fast and efficient service. I ve been coming here nearly daily for a year and I ve always loved it here, The food is great and gets here fast, the coffee is the best in Dublin (in my opinion) and the staff always have such a good energy about them! My favorite cafe in all of Dublin Food Tasty food, great coffee, nice atmosphere...checks all the boxes! Fantastic coffee, I have tried their blends in different shops around the city, but nothing compares to the OG! The food is on another level too, fried chicken bap hits the spot every time What an amazing spot for a delightful brunch and a Th3rdwave coffee! We highly recommend! Delicious pancakes, great cup of coffee. Everyone there seemed to be enjoying the location. Staff were very friendly and helped pick out a couple of bags of coffee beans to go. We had been waiting for a few months to try this place when we visited Ireland amd it was worth the wait. Excellent, especially the COFFEE!! A special taste that I cant describe but which is unique. You can even buy a pack, which I did immediately because I loved it so much. Delicious and plentiful dishes, perfect service! One of my favourite coffee shops in Dublin. I love the coffee from 3fe    , its delicious and they can always accommodate you for a particular coffee you might want. Staff is super nice and friendly Totally recommend it if you are around visiting Dublin and want to try one of the best coffee roasters. Service has gotten consistently worse unfortunately, I went in for a takeaway and waited five minutes before getting a hello and no order was taken, so I left whereas another day went in for brunch and sat at the table, gave them our order and half an hour later we checked and order was never put through. Coffee is the same as ever and the pastries are good. This is a serious contender for the best breakfast and coffee spot on my travels. Coffee is divine (one of the best filters I ever had), breakfast options can make anyone happy and they were so sweet to tweak the basic option of hash for me. Beware, the portions are huge! If you are looking for a hearty beginning of the day combined with really good coffee, search no more! And yes ,you can buy beans to take home too. The best in 3fe are the staff and the coffee. Coffee is excellent here, Im always enjoying their oat flat whites. I used to love their avocado hummus toast but they changed it slightly and its not as great. No salad, no seeds and brioche instead of wheat bread. Still good but nothing special. Great spot! Excellent coffee, tea, and food. We came here for brunch and really enjoyed the space and the experience. Staff was very kind and attentive. Food portions were big which was nice   Would recommend looking into reservations if you are coming for food on the weekend. Would recommend! Visited 3FE today and I have to say it was one of the nicest cafe experience I have ever had. I was seated straight away in the middle of the cafe. The staff were amazing, friendly and overall just a pleasure to be around. The coffee was great with the added bonus of nice latte art (with oat milk) and the eggs on toast was one of if not the nicest eggs sandwiches I had ever tasted. Everything on the plate worked so well together. Overall I had such a nice experience and will definitely be back for more in the future. Thanks for such a lovely lunch 3FE! Below are some images of the coffee and food. My mate and I had a great meal and cuppa there yesterday. I loved the chorizo mash bowl and they didnt hesitate to make a substitution for me. Very attractive plate presentation but no nonsense - if you want artfully dribbled sauces on whitespace, this isnt the place. But for great food the size of reasonable plates and friendly servers, come in! Lovely staff, nice and friendly atmosphere. Great for breakfast. Coffee is really good and food as well. Will be back! Normally the coffee here is easy 5 star but on our most recent trip the milk was WAY overheated.  It kind of ruined an otherwise beautifully roasted and brewed bean.  Well be back though, maybe this was a rare occurrence. Their coffee game is strong. As good as London and NYC. Better than Berlin. Not sure if this is there own roast in the espresso but the coffee was tasty and well balanced. Good selection of cakes and breakfast as well. The location is not wonderful but good number and seats inside and a place to sit outside in the sun. I d certainly recommend and heard the other site they have is great too. A must visit for coffee addicts. Delightful little coffee shop in Dublin, Ireland not too far from the docks. Coffee and pastries were delicious. Service was fast and friendly. The space is also pretty cozy, great spot for a work catch up our even a breakfast with friends. Phenomenal coffee, friendly staff, but cafe could do with some decor or other improvements to improve the ambience Great brunch place around Grand Canal with really good coffee! Everything was super fresh and tasty, and portions are huge (especially pancakes with fried chicken) Love 3FE, any day, anytime. The coffee is wonderful and absolutely love the healthy combinations they put together for brunch. Low key place, really nice staff. Nice to get a coffee, some weekend brunch or even spending some time reading. Gorgeous brunch, highly recommend the scrambled eggs! Only complaint would be the oat milk wasnt great, very grainy texture and ruined the coffee. The place had a fantastic vibe. The menu was simple and the breakfast was excellent, fresh and prepared quite quickly. The one thing that really stands out is the coffee it is absolutely delicious ! The staff have a great energy and the place is buzzing. Definitely worth a visit. Arguably one of the best cafes in Dublin. Great atmosphere, friendly and professional staff and world-class coffee & food. For me it s the first place to go in the morning when being in Dublin and I was never disappointed. What great way to start the day. A place to slow down and enjoy a good meal and a cup of coffee. Always happy to be back for a plate of pancakes or eggs. The crew is always very welcoming, which makes the whole atmosphere really warm and friendly. Baristas from Kyiv admitted that the 3fe coffee blends are one of the best they ve tried ;)"
3,Arthur Guinness Dwelling House,5.0,Who would think Guinness Beer at that time?
4,As One,4.45,"Came here on a Saturday morning without a booking and got a table at the corner. Ordered Hash up from the menu, which was pretty tasty. The coffee was surprisingly large but unfortunately not hot/warm enough (for my personal taste). Would recommend for a brunch! Great location, you can enjoy inside or outside your coffee. Order at the counter, quick and easy. Healthy food surrounded by lovely people. New, big with indoor (loud) and outdoor space. Central but out of city madness. Good quality food. Loved their brunch, has its own twist. Great service. They accommodated a request for a plate that was not on the menu that day. If sunny better off booking for a Saturday brunch. Loved their Hush Up. I visited recently as a solo diner. Lovely venue, nice, bright, and fresh. I arrived just before the lunch rush (its next to offices and got super busy very quickly). Started off well. Coffee and food arrived quickly. Both very tasty but the dish was missing some of the listed ingredients. I wasnt approached again afterwards until a good 40 mins later. And that was because I managed to flag down a staff member for the bill. The staff were pleasant and understandably busy, but I felt forgotten I had an amazing brunch experience at As One! The selection of brunch dishes was outstanding, and each one was a delightful culinary treat. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, making it the perfect place to start the day. The service was top-notch, with attentive staff who made sure we had everything we needed. I cant recommend their brunch enough   its a must-visit for anyone looking for a wonderful food experience! Great food set in a trendy industrial style environment. Service is fast and friendly. As One is a hidden gem in Dublin, Food: The food quality at As One is truly delightful. I recently ordered a seasonal main dish and was particularly impressed by the attention to detail, especially in the sauce. Their dedication to both culinary excellence and environmental stewardship is evident in every aspect of their food. Another aspect I adore about As One is their excellent coffee; the baristas skilful and artistic coffee pulling adds to the overall enjoyment, especially for someone who appreciates a well-crafted coffee. Service & Environment: The staff at As One is friendly and welcoming, creating an inviting atmosphere. The venue is versatile and suitable for business meetings and casual gatherings with family and friends. The modern environment and great music enhance the overall experience. Highly recommend!!!! Its a healthy food place, The beetroot soup(soup of the day) was ok if you like the taste of beetroot but I think it lacked in spices but the beef tacos were incredible(with the lime juice that was provided) Vegetarian options: Yeah a lot of vegetarian stuff it I remember correctly Dietary restrictions: A lot of vegetarian stuff I think Kid-friendliness: As good as most other places but if you kid is a picky eater maybe go somewhere else Amazing place for breakfast/brunch. Loads of seating, interior is beautiful, location is also great. The coffee is really good, all the pastries look amazing. We got a veggie hash up, and the Irish mushrooms on toast, both were really good. Staff is also awesome, even the loos are fab! I also really like how sustainable everything is, even the glasses are made from old bottles. Would highly recommend! Food is okay, portions could be more generous (e.g.  only one slice of bread with the fry). Poached eggs are slightly overcooked. Coffee was decent (proper flat white). Prices are normal for city centre Dublin (e.g.  15 for Irish Breakfast). Service is kind and quick, but I did need to ask twice for lowering the volume. Vibe: not great. Too cold since they insist on keeping the door open, despite 1deg outside. Also, too loud, with music thats more suitable for a gym! We visited twice in order to have both breakfast and lunch. A very wonderful setting, a calm area. There are tables both inside and outside, although the foul odor outside, possibly delivered by the river, somewhat detracted from the atmosphere. They paid a lot of care to the ecology, as evidenced by the use of cotton napkins. Although there arent many options on the menu, the food is nonetheless nice and tasty, both for breakfast and lunch. On the other side, the quantities should grow faster than the price. Friendly staff, however lunchtime service was a little slow, making it possibly unsuitable for individuals who needed to rush to the office. OMG OMG OMG, haven t had such a Gourgeous brunch in years. Food was fantastic, my first time  and will definitely be back. Tip for the chef everything was extremely tasty but the hash up dish and hash browns could ve been a bit less oily. The cappuccino flavour/temperature/texture to tier. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Really great place, nice vibe and friendly staff! The food included garlic which wasn t mentioned on the menu, but otherwise highly recommend, especially the coffee! A long term review as I ve been going here consistently for years now, I was in university for 4 years in Dublin and I can honestly say this was my favourite place I found in the city, the coffee is unbelievable maybe some of the best I ve ever had, the food is amazing and very seasonal, free range, organic etc (I normally don t even look for that stuff but it s definitely a bonus). The prices are great for what you get (even as a college student). The staff always seem happy and are amazing, attentive and helpful, the owner is always there and working along the staff, which is a great sign, the atmosphere is always buzzing, it s the kind of place that makes you happy to just be in. I worked in hospitality for years and I was in awe of how great all the staff were, It genuinely should be studied as how to run a business, I tried to go here as much as I could it was that good. Couldn t recommend enough. Amazing place and service. Very good food , rich and tasty food. Love the coffees.  Dont miss the Hash Up super good. Coffee was really good! Croissant was little bit cold. Atmosphere and service is really cool!! I really enjoyed the food here. I got the tofu focaccia and it was delicious but the portion a bit small i would say. Also the coffee was just okag, i got a cappucino in a same cup my friend got a latte and indeed ny cappucino had way too much milk. Overall experience was really nice though, as the staff was nice. As One provides sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the city. All the products are prepared on site and there is a real attention to detail in both service and quality of food. Sustainability is important to the business. The friendly atmosphere and relaxing surroundings are a perfect way to start the day. I love popping in for breakfast whenever I can. Highly recommend. Overall Great experience, service , food. Just add more Vegan options. Vegetarian options: Need more Vegan options With a mission of sustainability and tasty, healthy breakfast, this place is a winner.  The coffees are giant also. Vegetarian options: Vegan and veggie options galore. Got the pumpkin dish and it was very nice, but took a little while to get food during lunch rush. Would plan to have a bit more time if going again Tasteful and tasty! The food is great as is the coffee. I had the oatmeal which was the best I ve ever had! Served with superb granola, rhubarb puree and apple jelly, it has a delicate tartness and wholesome taste. Nice place to enjoy an Irish modern brunch. Staff is friendly, food was good but a bit pricey. Good gluten-free and vegetarian options. Its very noisy and loud though so that it was hard to hear everyone on a table of just 4 people. Good suggestions from staff. Absolutely delicious, homemade food, we have enjoyed it here. The place looks beautiful from outside and inside too. The baristas are really welcoming. The waiters and waitresses are friendly, and the team in the kitchen seems very skilled! You can sometime see them cook as they have an open kitchen. You can tell they know what they do from the taste and presentation of the food. Ive been there a lot at different times and was always happy of the service and the food. I found definitely recommend the halloumi dish (third pic) and the lamb flatbread (second pic), even though other dishes were equally tasty. Also, they serve the best chai latte that I have ever had in Dublin. Im honestly only bummed about one thing... We came here for our last breakfast before flying home. I could have come here every morning. This place rocks. The Coffee was fantastic, the Food was fantastic, the Cocktails are fantastic. They are so very welcoming, and you can tell the employees also care not only about the guests, but the food, and services they provide. They literally have a squatty potty in the bathroom. These are my kind of people. Tbf I like the restaurant and the staff are nice. However, Im disappointed with the food and the portion. The food was dry, non seasoned, and kinda cold. We have waited for around 40 minutes for this As One Brunch. The portion is like a starter rather than a main dish.... The other order - pasta was fine, my friend liked it. Maybe Im just out of luck Good spot for coffee and brunch. Nice space and nice things for sale too (notebooks, candles, serving boards, food products, etc.) Cool open space and lots of meat-free options on the menu too! Definitely worth a visit and in a good spot for a walk on the quays after! Vegetarian options: Many vegetarian options on the menu. Mushrooms on toast, halloumi, hash up, etc. Modern restaurant in office building. Nice outdoor seating area, inside echoes and is very noisy. Friendly, efficient service. Coffees were good. The smoked salmon omelette is more like a baked frittata and a bit dry. I ve gone 2 days in a row and tomorrow will be my third.  The tacos were good and full of flavor but the bomb was the mushroom toast.  Every bite was full of flavor and sunshine. The potatoes looked plain with no visible seasonings.  OMG!  I was wrong.   See you tomorrow As One A nice fine dine restaurant in the city, very close to GT. The food is well presented and tastes good. The coffee is on par. However, one small downside is that there is very limited choice for vegetarians. Overall a good fine dine place. LOVED THIS PLACE!! The whole concept is coherent and thoroughly applied. It sources everything from the island and looks out for every detail. Food is tasty, delicate, and in correct portions. Playlist is great, space is wide and comfortable, staff is nice and patient. Honestly, an admirable business. Keep it up!! Great food fresh and authentic. Portions were huge. My daughter had Coffee with oat milk and we ordered fresh juice. Portobello mushrooms on sourdough was delicious, halloumi salad was great. 2nd time here and love it. To say the atmosphere, staff, food & coffee give a vibe of Ill be back is an understatement. Everything about it screams feel good. The sourdough, poached eggs and greens were delicious, what a way to kick start Friday, left here with a pep in our step. Thanks so much to you all in As One, this morning Incredibly slow service, hair in the food, order mixups and confusion, served the wrong food, INCONSISTENT food, some steaks bloody some steaks grey and dead (both ordered medium rare), generally confused and moody servers with no control. A let-down. This is a lovely place for brunch. They offer a nice atmosphere and great food. I was impressed with the presentation and drinks too. Their service is great. I recommend the steak and eggs and the brisket for the meat lovers. Probably one of the best steak and eggs I had in Dublin. Just wish they had a bloody mary! Visiting from Canada, had the smoked salmon muffin which had great portion sizes and was awesome! Vibes are great and they really lean into sustainability with a small menu (decreasing food waste and vegan options), seasonal flavours from local farmers, coffee and tea are served in adorable sustainable Huskie mugs (that I might be buying for my home now), glassware is upcycled, and prices give me the feeling that everyone in the supply chain are paid fairly. Staff are super friendly and appear to enjoy working here. If we return to Ireland, we will def come back! Edit: they also provide free period products in the female bathroom! Vegetarian options: I saw 2/4 breakfast, 2/4 brunch items, 1/4 lunch items have vegan or vegetarian options. Wheelchair accessibility: No elevation into front door,  doors are nice and wide, accessible bathroom. Loved this place! Menu is great and coffee is delicious. Would definitely visit again during out next trip to Dublin! I called in As One for breakfast and I must say that the quality of the food was excellent and it was very tasty. All the staff were friendly and the service was first class. If you are looking for a lovely breakfast different from the norm, this is the place to visit. I visited yesterday for the monthly Sunday brunch with two friends. Really nice spacious and modern venue with a cosy vibe. I ordered the All In deal which is a mains, side, dessert and cocktail for  30. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were great, it was really good value for money. Staff were really friendly too, will definitely be back!"
5,Avoca Suffolk Street,4.025,"Really good experience at the cafe. The hostess and the staff was really friendly. The cheesecake of the day was fantastic. The coffee was decent as well. Highly recommend! We had a full Irish breakfast (tea included) and a  french toast. Service is speedy and food is great. It s just a tiny personal preference that knocked a star out; I would like the french toast be crispier on the outside and soft on the inside. Overall, I would still recommend a try. I have written about Avoca before, but this is one of my favorite places to be at and to eat at in Dublin. Always delicious, always beautiful, and the experience was just as great the second time around. Quality food, good portion, reasonable (for what you get) prices. I love the shop as well. Avoca Restaurant is a true culinary gem! From the moment I stepped in, I was enchanted by the amazing ambiance. The service was impeccable by Patricia, and the menu offered a delightful array of dishes. I ordered a Full Irish Breakfast, I savored each bite. I also tried the Blueberries Pancakes, infact the berries compote was the best! and the flavors were exquisite. A five-star dining experience that I cant wait to repeat! Amazing store and ambience is another level. Staff is super friendly and nice. Best thing on 2nd floor they have a restaurant. This is very good food and they also have a kids menu at 2nd floor restaurant. If one wants sandwiches and salads ground floor has deli counter with many delicious options Haven t been here for a few years. The food was fine, but the attitude of the staff is abysmal. Borderline rude and dismissive to customers. Food was practically thrown on the table. My wife was bumped into several times by the same waiter, and a chair was left almost on top of her during our meal. We won t be back. Shame, as it used to be a go-to spot. One of the best customer experience I ve had in Dublin. They took some of the past reviews pretty seriously I think  i immediately got seated when I arrived. It was so pack when I was there but I could see that all their staff are trying to be super efficient to accommodate customers and they re doing a great job! Loved the flat white, a bit on the stronger side  the pancakes are to die for though as usual it s a lot for me. I would definitely come back for their scones cause it seems popular based on other reviews and also their other pastries/cakes. The shop downstairs has really nice and unique items. They are pricey but they are of good quality Overall: pretty disappointing. While the food itself was tasty, the service was poor. Our orders were taken in a hurry and our plates were cleared before everybody had finished eating. There s also a  no splitting bills  policy which I think is unreasonable and off putting. I always enjoy Suffolk Street for lovely treats and gifts, wonderful merchandise  and gorgeous displays, impeccable  taste. But, service and customer care has greatly  deteriorated. No commitment, no communication, just arrogance and rudeness, no more pleasant, smiling  faces. I experienced  this attitude this week and and 3 weeks ago. Frustrated staff, more interested in their laptops than their customers I love this store which offers a multitude of products. There is a cafe, a grocery store, fashion, accessories, jewelry. Not to be missed, the superb collections for the home (decoration, tableware, linens) of great quality! The flagship product is the wool throw in superb colors. We even fall for the super original wool socks. For all budgets, the products are quality and made in Ireland. Grocery store side: wide choice of chocolate, fudge, marmalade, jam, chutney.... perfect for making gifts! In addition, the setting is warm, very pleasant and everything is perfectly arranged. No more souvenir shops that abound in town and we choose quality! A real favorite. Although its expensive, the food is excellent! Coffee is on the last floor and is very comfortable, with plenty of light and space. Food was good, maybe a bit expensive and dessert were excellents (both size and taste). I can recommend the coffee cake, completely worth it Food was great! The shop has a lot of cute products, but a bit on the pricey side. Very delicious but a bit pricey, the  fresh squeezed  juice was for sure not fresh squeezed but the food was amazing. Walking up to the cafe, there was a distinct smell of diarrhea but the cafe floor smelled fine. The cappuccino and French toast were phenomenal and I was told the poached eggs were also very good. Carrot cake and pear tartare! Great coffee selections and brunch combo. Located in a fashion shop on their third floor, come in before 2 pm you will have the sun in dinning room. Don t wait for lift it takes forever so use the stairs for sure. Kids friendly, not much accessibility since the lift is in the corner of the building and hard to get around tables. Amazing Avoca! Came highly recommended to me and did not disappoint. So much choice on the lunch menu and the cakes were divine. Speedy service. Exquisite jewellery in-store. Loved Avoca so much that I visited twice in the same day! Very friendly servers, but the restaurants decor is unimaginative and jaded, the chairs uncomfortable, the acoustics loud and intrusive, the menu peculiarly eclectic and my choice (black bean and sweet potato fritters) was luke-warm and unappetising. The prices, despite the huge portions, were too high for lunch. I wont be back. Great selection of unique gifts, houseware and clothing. Priced in the mid-range, a great place to wander around in. Staff was friendly, professional and very helpful. Great department store, but the highlight For us was the restaurant. Recommend soup if the day with croque Monsieur. Quirky decor to enjoy too! Service top quality. Firecracker chicken burger was disappointing- dry & no spice at all despite Sciracha mayo mentioned. Location is fab & very welcoming I went here for lunch on a weekday. The cafe is decorated with old furnitures and its half full. Menu is really simple and staffs were really friendly and service was quick. I ordered the lamb burger with a glass of lemonade. The burger comes with three dips(hummus, tzatziki and ketchup, more than enough) and chips and it was perfectly cooked. The lemonade was nice but a bit watery for my taste. My wife suffered from serious scone envy as she had poached eggs on avocado but a neighbouring table had scones. My poached eggs and salmon was very tasty. The food was great but the cafe earned 4stars really due to the staff. As tourists they were so helpful teaching us how to make the most of the transport using a leap card ( dublin version of a oyster card). Beautiful store with lots of wonderful products. Lovely displays and so easily tempting a purchase. Cafe was equally great. Food was very good which exceeded expeditions. The Crab Salad was delicious and the flavours very well thought through. We will be back. One of the worst costumer service I have had in my 2 months of living in Dublin... The Lady who managed the place was unfriendly from the moment I entered the Cafe. She was rude and unfriendly during the service as well and she was explaining this behavior by the fact that they had a lot of people to serve. One of my absolute favorite places in Dublin! The cafe upstairs has been a favorite for cakes and coffees and getting schoolwork done. Everyone here has always been super nice and helpful! Cheesecake far too dense and not much flavour. Friend had veg soup that was revolting. It was far too salty and rather watery. Soup was taken off bill but dont expect food like this in Avoca Casual dining, not too busy on a Tuesday in March, just before Easter Sunday. Good food served by pleasant staff. Loved it! Best scones. Lively and pretty cafe at the top of the store. Very nice store to buy gifts. My wife said she wanted a blanket, she bought two.  She told me that Avoca blankets are the best.  There are so many colors here that you should find exactly what you want. Loos need to be refurbished and way too far away from cafe.  Policy of not splitting bill is ridiculous in this day and age! Do better please@ Magnificent and tasteful boutique. The selection is refined. Absolutely delicious restaurant: salad, soup...not forgetting the desserts which are exquisite. The staff is very pleasant. I recommend this place and this restaurant The upstairs cafe hideaway has One of the best chocolate brownie with hazelnut I have ever had! Its so rich and chocolaty with some cream on the side. It doesnt look like much but the surprise of heaven will be revealed at the first bite. And after all that richness, you can go downstairs and purchase some of the amazingly designed items in the store. Carrot cake to die for! Generous portion. Friendly staff. Not too busy. Also have a lift which is great.Toilets on 3rd floor. Would recommend for shoppers. Will call again. I found the security guard watching me to much. I felt embarrassed as I am in my 50s and never stole in any shop and he was watching me so much. The environment was good The food was good Just the service have to be improved. We was here around 2:00pm Asking to change the table with cables because my computer battery was died and I need to summit important documents. The guy staff told me the table was only for 4people but that s was so many empty table. The funny things is after 5min, one lady just sit down with the table that we ask for. I think the staff have learn how to be more flexibility. We passed by this establishment somewhat randomly. The decoration is very cute, and there are lots of choices for giving gifts. However, our downside lies more with the cafe, located at the very top of the establishment. Even if the place is nice, our experience itself was mixed: out of four things ordered > two errors, staff sometimes friendly > sometimes less, prices overall rather high. However, I would still like to point out that the dishes served to us were good. Despite the remark, and several apologies from our waitress, no action. We do not recommend this place. Open the door of the charming Avocado store: not only do you want to buy everything, but you also find a very nice restaurant on the second floor. Quite romantic decoration, refined menu with fresh products and low prices. We enjoyed ourselves this lunchtime with a salad (crab, seeds & various very well seasoned vegetables, Irish soda bread) and a burger (good meat and good cheese). We had a lovely meal here. The soup was absolutely delicious!! If you like amazingly fluffy French Toast (with excellent berry accompaniments) or some wonderfully warm and hearty Shashuka with flatbread then here is your place! Staff were friendly and efficient It is hard for me writing this review because in many ways I really enjoyed my visit but at the same time I still felt that it just missed the mark in ways that are hard to explain. The food was tasteful and beautifully plated but also seemed to playing it a bit too safe and traditional, nothing to make it really stand out. Same goes for the wine and the decor and the staff didnt seem to be as attentive as at least I would expect even though I saw planty of staff at work. I just had a slight feeling that everyone was a little too comfortable in how things are and have been for a long time and they dont strive for making things better still"
6,Bad Ass Cafe,4.325,"Great place to listen to live music, food was available but we didnt try this time. We will definitely return and try next time. Amazing atmosphere great friendly staff and good choice of drinks. Well worth a visit Top live music every evening.  Excellent food.  Special drinks and fabulous Guinness.  I love Dublin and BadAss We went there on St. Patricks Eve, great atmosphere but too many people, we didnt stay. The next day we ate there at midday, quieter and still a nice atmosphere. Perfect dish and very good beer. Nothing to say, very good service, top decor, I recommend. Good beer and good music. Go on Saturday Sunday or Monday, the guitar player is amazing. He can pretty much play any song you request and put a little Irish spin on it. Didnt have food but its a great place for live music, a sing and a dance. Fast service at the bar. This place made our trip so much fun. If you see this bouncer (and the owner), steer clear. I was in there for over 2 hours, no issues, and then as I was leaving I stopped to speak to another patron and I was manhandled by the South American bouncer pictured. I was in a moonboot without crutches when he manhandled me. When challenged he proceeded to pin me against the fence outside the bar. Live music and a good vibe even on Sunday evening, busy but too loud or overcrowded! Service was good and fast, id recommend the beef & Guinness stew! I just got in to absorb the crazy atmosphere and I wasnt disappointed! Cool pub in the Temple Bar (Irish: Barra an Teampaill). Live music, good beer on tap (Guinness) and excellent and fast service for a crowded place. Very good pub! Often less armored than the others in Temple Bar which makes it all the more pleasant. The decor is well thought out and there are often local guitar or flute concerts. Possible to eat on site upstairs but we were only there to have a drink. We have eaten the wings and the goat cheese salad. It was perfect for a pub to have these options and with good quality. The staff are very friendly and the live music is just amazing I wasnt inside, i didnt drink anything. I just stood outside with hundred others and enjoyed the great guitarist oozing banger after banger from those strings. Such an incredible atmosphere and vibe which i havent felt anywhere else. And I wasnt even inside.... Nice place with live music, craft beer and food. Have 2 floors, a bar at first and a restaurant on the 2nd. Food was tasty, beers also. Very good fish and chips Popped in for a few beer and to take in the live music. Fella played the standard popular set list but was dandy. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great too. Way overpriced and not worth it!! I had a goat s cheese salad (so sorry now not to have taken a picture). A small round of cheese, a few mixed salad leaves, a cut up beetroot, and walnuts - priced at 18.95!! A Diet Coke 4.10 and a glass of draft beer 4.60. Note: This was a Saturday afternoon, so not even night rates. My grandson had a child s pizza, cost 10.00, no cordial or any other offer such as a scoop of ice-cream with the kids menu. The place was empty. The only reason I stayed was because they had pizza on the menu and that s what my grandson wanted. Not being a Dublin native I didn t know where else to find a good pizza restaurant and we were hungry. Definitely won t be going back again. Popped in here for the music as it was trad fest weekend and we were not disappointed.  The talented singers kept us entertained with great music. Definitely worth a visit if your in the temple bar area. Early dinner with two small children. Food was good and enjoyable but nothing exceptional. Laid back atmosphere was ideal for eating with kids. Would come back. Kid-friendliness: Good kids menu and high chairs available A pub renowned for evenings with a guaranteed atmosphere. However a little overrated and in need of a nice restoration.... It was a really nice place with live music and good vibes. We had out dinner in their restaurant upstairs, good food. The soup was delicious and the meat very tender!! Very good address in Dublin. On the ground floor the pub with live music, people and noise. Upstairs restaurant table with just the audio feedback from the artist. Hearty and tasty dishes. Live music was first class, Sharkey is phenomenal, IMHO greatest guitar player alive today! Great live music in the heart of Dublin :) Having used to frequent this bar in the late 90 s, I was excited to bring my daughter here for her 21st birthday, in the same iconic style I celebrated mine. Couldn t rate it more. Both evenings (Sat & Sun) we went the music was amazing, the guys took requests and nailed each song they did. Would go back in a heartbeat and have no reservations in recommending this bar to anyone visiting. We found it to be friendly and felt completely safe down to the security guy being on the ball with anyone that appeared to have had one too many Guinnesss. Thank you for helping make my daughter birthday weekend a blast. Slainte Can t comment on the food as we were there for evening drinks. Very friendly and lively atmosphere. Live music was great and the staff did a great job of managing the space when it started to get busy. Left smiling. Guinness on tap was great. Great music, really enjoyed the two lads playing on the Saturday night. Great singers and made the place have a great atmosphere. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. Please don t go there it s a good night but the bouncers are a disgrace!! I was dancing with my girlfriend and they kick us out because I lifted her up. They could ve told us to put her down. But instead they kicked us out stars and tried to fight us. The bouncers are scumbags. Please do not visit this place because it is not a nice place to enjoy yourself. Stopped in on a Thursday afternoon for a pint and stayed until closing. Great selection of adult beverages and the evening 2 man music group was amazing. A friendly group singing and dancing the night away. Get there early enought to get a stool and barrel. Great restaurant, nice environment upstairs with a street view of the Temple Bar area. The pub after the meal was hot with a party atmosphere. To recommend. The Service in general inside it s really great and friendly but the useless  cara  that they hired as  security  (a Brazilian with ponytail) was a scumbag, we were not even drunk nor nothing and he was pushing us to go inside again, when we was trying to say goodbye to some friends. I hope you can teach that neanderthal some modals I was there to listen to live music and drink, I didnt consume food But the atmosphere is very good, with good music and the ample space on the ground floor, although there is another space on the first floor that I didnt go to, because I was enjoying the music and atmosphere. Service Great atmosphere, with live music, they also do open mic sessions. Went in to listen to the music. We had a few drinks. Great people there. Fantastic night. Turned up at midnight and place was Rockin. Great live music,(Ger). We will return !! Bouncer on the door on 13th April 2024, denied me access because I had tracksuit bottoms on(fair enough) but he had let 3 younger ladies in and 2 had chenile style joggers on with UGG boots and in the queue before me proceed to let a family in with 2 kids with joggers/ tracksuit bottoms on. When I said to him why did you let them in but you cant let me in ( he said its my turf and spat on the floor) what an absolute tosspot!! Went to 3 other bars closeby and let us in straight away, doorman get bad names because of the likes of him. Loads of fun people. Only 1 annoying guy, dutch guy named Jan. Was downing pints like water. Constantly shouting  meow meow !! Very nice address, the place is very pleasant, the service friendly, and the dishes delicious. I recommend the Irish stew a la Guiness...  18.50 per dish. The restaurant is on the first floor, you can enjoy the concerts, without the crowds on the ground floor and at a very pleasant noise level. Great place, brilliant musician singing , had great craic, didnt have food but menu looked good The live music was too good. I went during the pride parade day and there was no seating arrangements, not sure if thats the case for all the days. But I absolutely loved the ambience. Good service. Didnt try any food Nice restaurant, but not the best or most typical. The starters were not amazing, but the beef and Guinness stew was very good."
7,Be Sweet Cafe,4.6,"Nice little cafe in this busy area. The girls were very approachable, and kindly explained to us what each thing was. We ordered the plain crossiant and the almond crossiant with two coffee. Would definitely go back again. Very cute dessert cafe! When you enter this place it just brightens our days with their unique decor and very cute animal gummy candies. Even the coffees are nicely designed with colorful feathers to match the theme of the cafe with peacocks and tropical forest. I absolutely loved it here. The interior inside is simply stunning. Love the quirky little drink orders and the cakes are beautiful. I adored the tiny jelly animals and would have bought them all if I could! Its a little bit small but if its just yourself and a friend, its well worth a visit. Such a beautiful and cute place. I was very surprised to find something this good in Dublin. State of the art coffee and very beautiful pastries. The decor is so gorgeous even though I just had my breakfast, I cant help but walk in Be Sweet Cafe and have more coffee. The tranquil coffee is amazing, the and decor is like a beautiful peacock inside jungles. I love how the cafe owner puts so much heart into decorations that makes us feel special. love it! Indeed very sweet. Super kid friendly, I went in there with my 10 and 5 year old and got 2 great Lattes for my wife and myself, delicious drinking chocolate for the kids and some chocolate baked goods, we were visiting home from Germany and loved seeing the 2 Nutcrackers posted at the door. We went there again with friends, still super friendly to the kids even when we were louder. Sweets are as always lovely Kid-friendliness: Very friendly to our kids, they engaged with them and asked their ages and what they got from Santa,the drinking chocolate was a perfect temperature for the kids so they could start drinking, the kids were loud whilst waiting but as their drinks were served super quickly they were soon very happy drinking away. Lovely little place, but it is difficult to sit down because of limited space .Beautiful wallpaper, decorations, unusual plates on the kitch side, but charming. We only had cakes, tasty but in my opinion overly sweet, just right for other people. Pretty bag if you buy pastries for takeaway, not cheap (see location) This place is decorated fabulously, maximal lux, definitely insta worthy. The coffee is good, and the little compliment chocolates is a lovely touch. The pastries and cakes look lovely. Although I found the cake I had very heavy. Also, although the disposable gold forks look lovely I think that maybe a more recyclable option could be considered. But its fun so definitely go and enjoy!! Lovely and cosy cafe in town! The staff is super friendly and welcoming, my new coffee spot Food Eclectic interior, delightful service & gorgeous coffee, this place is a real treat! Delicious sweet bites, my personal favourites are the macarons! Big fan of Be Sweet Food : 5/5 Love the decor and selection. The lady was very helpful too. I ordered a slice of cake (they had two similar cakes). I tried the white chocolate and raspberry. It tasted bit too childrens party for me - you know when you can feel the sugar crunch from cheap frosting? Unfortunately, they didnt have fresh cream to serve with it, which was disappointing. I couldnt gauge the other buns and pastries, but Id make two suggestions: #1 Have labels. The lady had to name everything for me. #2 If youve ever watched Gorden Ramsey youd know the lesson of having a small menu and doing those few items well. With probably more than 15 different types of buns and cakes, its hard to do them well and just as difficult to keep them fresh. My cake was at least one day old. Lovely little spot in the city for a treat. We went early in the morning and had a coffee and pastry. The girls at the counter were very friendly and helpful, they explained all the different treats and what was popular. I had a Madame butterfly which was nice as a treat but too fancy to be getting all the time. The decor inside is what makes the place extra special The Stuff is sweet and Kind! The Coconut Latte was lovely and hit the spot. The decor is quaint and a good space for a quick sit in or grab and go. The pastries looked delicious. And remember always be Sweet!! The outside is catchy in appearance. Inside, as small as they are, youre definitely not stuck for choice, there are so many treats to choose from. This time, I decided to try the carrot cake, next time will definitely be something else. Treats are good, their coffee not. Very cozy, jungle-and-glitter themed coffee & sweet shop. Sitting in the back for approximately 20 people. Some sitting is with chairs, there are few taburettes and one sofa/bench. Coffee was the type where you dont feel the acidity, I liked it. Three freezers stuffed with cakes. Will come again Parking: Street parking not available in the area, theres a paid underground garage nearby We bought some delicious treats to bring to a friend s home! The employee was very helpful with selections and ingredient info. Beautiful place, the decor is stunning. Pet friendly. Great staff. They welcome me in and said goodbye . Loved it here. Cosy environment. Love the decor and the coffee. Will be back. Thanks for being nice . It helps. Visiting Dublin from Norway, this little Jewel of Dublin takes you into 80 days around the world adventure. From Blue Spirulina and Dragon fruit latte to colourful sweets. Definitely a must when in Dublin. Great place & atmosphere, very small but a nice place to get an afternoon coffee & cupcake. Dogs are welcomed. Food Absolutely stunning cafe, most aesthetic cafe I ve yet seen in Ireland. A pleasure to sit in for a coffee and a read. Magical!!! Live this place, excellent sweets and coffee. Also appreciate the packaging, the takeaway boxes and bags are good quality. Thanks again! Fantastic little place. Very clean. Got a decaff latte with coconut milk and my sister got a chai latte with oat. Came with a little truffle which was delish! Will be back! Its a lovely place but the whole idea of going and have a coffee in a place is to sit down in a comfy tables with normal mugs instead of cardboard cups. Please keep in mind these. Be Sweet Cafe had a nice vibe to it and is very Instagramable... Thats the main positives from our short visit. The coffee was quite weak despite taking an extra expresso shot. We were served with paper cups eventhough we ordered to sit in and get a feel for the atmosphere. This brings me to the very cramped sitting arrangement... Most tables only sat two people in a very cramped space. At one stage I used the person behind me as a back rest. Personally, if space and the weak coffee were not an issue Id rate it higher. It was a lovely cafe with beautiful interior designs. Loved the food. Highly recommended The Be Sweet Cafe, in the heart of Dublin, advocates love and kindness. I liked the decor, the storefront is one of the most attractive I have ever seen. The welcome and the coffee were in unison. Want to return while passing through this super shopping district of Dublin, see Grafton Street just a stones throw away. A hidden gem in central Dublin This is such a wonderful coffee place! Cosy with kitschy interior and amazing cupcakes and other sweets with a twist. Very good coffee.  Highly recommended! Food The flat white coffee is very tasty, unlike other coffee shops, and the welcome dessert with coffee is very tasty and light Nice choice of desserts, though drinks are a bit more expensive than I would like to pay. Comfortable chairs that we both enjoyed sitting on. The golden plate was nice. I stumbled across this when I was in town with my daughter. One look in the door and were straight in. This is a lovely little cosy spot. Really good coffee and some nice treats to enjoy. Very friendly staff, great service. This is a nice cafe and ambiance is amazing  . Food and coffee is great and this is a must visit cafe A place to absolutely visit! Love the ambiance and the interior design is just amazing! Coffee was so nice and perfect for good moments Beautiful Cafe, offering delicious cakes and good coffee. The interior is amazing, very nice decoration and the staff is welcoming and friendly. All in all a great spot to go. Can t recommend this beautiful cafe enough! Took my Mum for Afternoon Tea on Mothers Day. It was her first time visiting and she was blown away by the beautiful decor and ambiance. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had the most perfect experience. The food was delicious and the attention to detail was second to none!  A must visit if you are in Dublin City. Can t wait to return Wonderful atmosphere and almond croissant was just amazing Best Package  and best atmosphere But Too sweet lemon cake Best coffee in Dublin & delicious sweet treats. Staff and interior are amazing. Highly recommend visiting 10/10 Prices ok. Good aesthetics, but thats all. Coffee is a huge let down, as the pastries. Not recommended is you truly like coffee tasting."
8,Bean & Gone Coffee Shop,2.85,"Baileys coffee is nice. (Edit)Today i returned the first coffee ever in my life. No refund given. I was given a nice baileys coffee for 6.50 off i think it was the manager on other occasions, older more experienced lovely lady, always had nice coffee until 2 young, either under trained or scam artist young women, one short hair on the till and one with glasses hair tied in a bun ripped me off put a half shot of baileys, probably a quarter of the small americano sized white cups with coffee and the rest cream. I paid 6.50 for a cup of cream, explained (ive been a loyal customer, have a loyalty card and never had a problem until today) that ive been here regularly before and asked them to re do it properly like ive had previous trips to bean and gone. And i should have never went in today, young staff REALLY need training or to be stopped skimming to make up tips for themselfs. Rip off, lovely little cafe when run properly. Very dissappointed. My favourite coffee shop , Debbie and Ava are amazing girls who are tops at customer service , bring back the loyalty cards please Great worker, but the food is horrid. Cheap tho. Emergencies only and even then just go to any other store around Cool little spot for a quick coffee or bite to eat before getting on the train. Good snacks and coffee. I was with a group of friends, I didnt order anything but everyone else did. I looked over at the workers, and they had their flashlights on their phones, it looked like they were both taking pictures, and smirking. They must have noticed me and stopped. I dont appreciate how rude they were. Since when it is acceptable to blast Indian music in this coffee shop? Good coffee , great staff My daughter got an uncooked sausage roll from here. When she brought it to the attention of staff she was told that that s was the way it was meant to be and refused to give her a refund.  Needless to say she put it in the bin. Unfortunately due to poorly fitted lids my coffee spilt down my chest causing a severe burn. I rang the coffee shop to inform them of what happened and I was told there was a problem with the lids. The lady I spoke to asked me to email her through a description of what happened so she could fill out an incident form. I did this the same day and sent pictures of the burn. A week later I have not received any reply to my email. I will most likely be left with a scar from the burn. If they knee there was a problem with the lids they should have informed customers. Lovely cafe, vanilla latte was hot and creamy, exactly the way it should be (couldve used another shot of vanilla syrup, but thats just my sweet tooth  ) Nice selection of deli food available as well and staff are pleasant and friendly. Will definitely be back again, and again. They have cheaped out on the coffee cups. The lids do not fit and coffee spills everywhere. I tried three lids. By the time I got to my train I had coffee all down my arm and all over the table where I chose to sit on the train. I had to whip it up with my sleeve. I might as well not have put a lid on. Bulk price online they can t go for much, spend an extra couple euro for the coffee cups! Your in the train station so you must be making loads of money! An absolute joke. I never write reviews, this is my first one, that s how mad and baffled I am. Your name is bean and gone just like me! Staff are always friendly but one Lady in particular with short hair, shes kind to literally every single customer and will always make an effort to talk to you and wish you well the rest of the day The chocolate croissant is quite nice. But the hot chocolate just tastes like the stupid paper cup it comes in and its done with water, so stale. So much trash generated by this places stupid cups. Maybe offer mugs for those staying. Have just left this coffe shop to board a train to Belfast at 7.35am. The blonde lady who served my 80 year old father you seriously need a lesson in manners and basic customer service. Having misheard his order and he your double check of it you proceeded to berate him over your mistake in pouring an espresso instead of Americano. I work in public service and pride myself and my colleagues on how we treat customers of a certain age. Regardless of whether you are having a bad day, just remember he may be the only face he sees all day or the only person he has any level of communication with. I did notice that you offered the younger man next in line from us a more friendly and curteous customer experience. Shame on you. December 2nd 2017 at 7am. Was the weakest Americano Ive ever had the misfortune to taste, water with the faintest hint of coffee infusion. Dire. Expensive. Great coffee spot to get your morning fix on the go,   HOT BEVERAGES WITH A LITTLE EXTRA TIPPLE!!  Menu are a nice touch Really nice cup of coffee. If you need a cup for traveling or just waiting for friends. This place have really nice coffee and treats. Highly recommend. Great coffee, much nicer option than pret, and cheaper 1 for just hot water, most places do it for free. No mention of the charge beforehand either. Disappointing Lovely coffee , friendly staff and nice customer service. Getting my coffee and some breakfast every morning on my way to work . Really recommend this place . Good spot to get a quick hot snack to take on the train. Staff friendly and helpful. Not bad value. Best Latte I have ever hard... Very hot they way it should be. Staff Very good Expensive, extra charge for soy milk and it doesnt accept debit cards under 10 . Rude staff very unfriendly. Go somewhere else. my sausage roll was raw, pigeons enjoyed it tho Worst coffee ever   plus that I asked for a Flat white and it was served in a cappuccino cup. I guess the staff needs a barista training... I was there yesterday the food was absolutely disgusting got 2 breakfast rolls and sausages we left them behind us ...I would have complained then and there  only my children didnt want me to make a seen ,.. STAY AWAY DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY Rude staff + highly recommend you sign them up for barista training Wonderful Friendly staff  , great food, relaxing atmosphere, Prices are great. Try a hot raspberry scone Sausage rolls were raw. Pink inside Vegetarian options: i also got the vegan sausage roll and it was also raw Great little cafe to have something to eat and drink while waiting for a train Got a tuna sandwich at connoly station today, there was a snail in the lettuce!!! Gross!!! Pass and use it frequently, always plessent experience and very nice staff Handy cafe at the station, nice sandwich filling selection Nice little coffee shop. Good coffee at reasonable prices. Nice but but very expensive for pot of tea for 3 and 4scones 25e Stopped by to ask a quick question got looked at like I was asking somthing insane. Is a basic standard station coffee shop Nice staff good coffee nan"
9,Beanhive Coffee,4.65,"Best cappuccino that I ve had the pleasure to imbibe within the past year. Smooth with a fantastic roasted bean flavour and perfect balance. Worth the trip and the wait. Despite its small size (7 interior seats and 16 external) this is a fantastic local and independent coffee shop with a novel experience level. The coffee is slow to come as they put both effort and love into the art. So patience is a must. A Must Try for coffee lovers. Very nice place. Great service. And great baked food. We loved the added designs on the coffee and London fog tea. We would love if the place had more space to sit, as it was quite crowded and with its popularity, it is a challenge to get a seat. Wheelchair accessibility: Yes I dined in for breakfast (Super Breakfast), and had a wrap (The Queen Bee) and muffin (raspberry pistachio) for take out: both meals were phenomenal in portion and flavour. I also had a mulled spiced chai which was included with the breakfast and it made me so happy. Their branding is very cute and the spot is quaint, getting a table inside can be difficult but sitting outside on the street does not take away from the experience as the staff will take care of you no matter what. All in all a great eatery, I would highly recommend stopping by :) Dietary restrictions: Lots of great options for those with different diets, as well as vegetarian/vegan choices Parking: Dublin is a walkable city, parking is difficult. Wheelchair accessibility: Not possible to get in with a wheelchair, too small such a charming cute little place right near the city centre! ideal options for instagram hangouts or dates. the staff were so lovely and i was impressed by the range of vegetarian and gluten free options. the muffins were larger than my hand! Vegetarian options: many spicy vegetarian options and a wide range :) Dietary restrictions: many gluten free options for desserts! I came to eat an Irish breakfast, and it was really good! It was delicious. Small place but warm welcome and service. The prices are fair (14  main course + drink). You can go there with your eyes closed! Finally got to try this place today. We were so happy - Only just went for the coffee art. Went on 3 different occasions, and they were completely full. Amazing and very polite staff. Thank you. Coffees are amazing and the element if surprise is just fabulous...Thank You Food Cute cafe with tasty food and fast friendly service! My daughter and I shared the vegetarian breakfast and a couple of dirty chai teas. The breakfast was delicious and plenty of food, and the teas were generous and yummy. Definitely recommended! Really great cafe.  It s cozy, friendly and clean. Fantastic food and beautiful coffee art.  Definitely would return again. I liked it a lot, The customer service was excellent. Tasty food, generous portions. Good prices. Nice place to stay in a rainy day, with a lovely cat face coffee. I love this place. The coffee was good and their muffins are awesome!! I tried strawberry&pistachio flavour, it was amazing. Additionally, it s conveniently located near st. Stephen park, so you can grab you order to go and enjoy it there. Food Excellent coffees and breakfast! The cafes are very good, and nicely decorated! The service is fast, the servers are pleasant. Irish breakfast well served and excellent! However, there are people eating there, we arrived at the opening to have space! Now this is coffee done right! Tasty coffee, quick service, delicious muffins, and Taylor Swift playing on the speakers! It is a little tight squeeze inside, but once you ve got your coffee, you ll be happy at the first sight of cute art! Love it! They don t have gluten-free, but they have low gluten muffins due to baking in a shared over. A very cute place. We went on Saturday, it was very crowded, we had to wait to sit down but it was worth it. The Irish breakfast and super breakfast were good, the dirty chai is delicious and the coffee art makes the experience more unique. The quality/price ratio is really good, I recommend. Vegetarian options: Vegetarian breakfast and Vegan breakfast Wheelchair accessibility: Sitting outside is possible, inside not possible for a wheelchair, theres a step and its very small Beanhive Coffee is a small cafe located on Dawson street, one of Dublins busiest streets, very close to the Saint Stephen Green park . I was even going to the park on a Sunday when I passed in front of this cafe, but there was a very busy, with lots of people waiting and I decided not to stand in line. So I took a photo of the place to remember later on, then I went back on another day during the week. I arrived around 1 pm, and because it is a small cafe, there were no place to eat inside, however they gave me the option to wait, so I took a number and I wait for around 15 minutes, but it was totally worth it. I ordered the Irish Breakfast which was delicious, but they also have other options, including vegan options. I also bought muffins to take away and they were also delicious. But what I liked most was my coffee with the Dublin design, which was cute and very tasty! You need to ask them in advance, as soon as you order your coffee, and they have different designs that you can choose from. The designs are also not available for all kind of coffees, it looks like its for hot chocolate and moccha coffee, but just ask them. I believe there is no way to reserve a table online, since its a small coffee shop, so if you want to eat there you will have to wait if there is no table available, however there appears to be an option to order online for pickup if you prefer. Love the vibe, love the service. BeanHive Cafe truly knows how to brew a fantastic cup of joe. They made us some cute designs on our coffee which was fab. But its not just about the coffee; the menu offers a delightful array of treats and snacks. I couldnt resist trying their pastries, and they were absolutely scrumptious. What really sets this cafe apart, though, is the friendly and attentive staff. They were not only knowledgeable about the menu but also eager to ensure that my visit was enjoyable. Their passion for what they do shines through in their service. Whether youre looking for a spot to catch up with friends, or simply enjoy a great cup of coffee and a pastry, I highly recommend BeanHive Cafe. Its a hidden gem that deserves to be discovered, and I cant wait to return for another visit. The food was so good that my group and I went back twice. It is well worth any wait that you may encounter. Our food came out in a timely manner, was hot, and delicious. I enjoyed every bit of it. The atmosphere was great for small groups as well as families. On my first visit I enjoyed a super breakfast and on my second visit I had the avocado supreme. Both meals were great and I would recommend them both. For drinks I had a cappuccino with a design. It was so cute and tasted amazing, absolutely perfect. On my second visit I had the mango smoothie. It was big, but I was able to finish it up. When ordering remember that portions are pretty big. Be ready to take some home with you. Overall some of the best meals I ve had in Ireland. Service was also top notch. Very attentive staff! I ll be back during my next visit. Small place A little lack of cleaning (our glass of water had a piece of something inside and we had to change it) Good breakfast Passable coffee (a little bitter for my taste, I needed sugar and I dont usually add it) Very cute little cafe, with super sweet and *free* art on your coffee! The wraps and sandwiches were nice, although the flavour of my wrap could have been stronger and I wasn t a big fan of the kind of cheese they had used. Overall a really nice place though! Small cafe with nice breakfast :) They draw cute pictures onto every coffee or hot chocolate which I find really nice. Staff was kind. Located on a busy street, so rather loud and not really cozy. Still recommend to visit! I went for the coffee art, but I have got just a regular one, I get it, mine was vegan, so it has a different shape of foam, but my husband had a regular one and it was the same as usually everywhere in a coffee shop. Well, the coffee tastes really well and the muffins are pretty tasty, but I am disappointed by not getting the coffee with art P.s. now I know from the answer, that FYI: YOU HAVE TO REQUEST THE ART I am writing it with big letters, just to let you know Pretty solid full Irish breakfast.  I d like my tomato cooked a little more.  Not the best I had in Dublin but definitely good.  I d come back.  Nice they open early.  I like the outside tables.  There is not a lot of seating. Absolutely wonderful breakfast and coffee. Best we had in Dublin. Fresh ingredients and very healthy options. Dietary restrictions: Lots of delicious low-gluten options. The sandwiches were delicious and the staff were so friendly. Definitely will come again. We tried Mr Beanhive and Italiano classic. Id recommend Mr Beanhive with Ciabatta. And they have go vegan option for everything in the menu. I loveeee it, that coffee shop now is one of my favourite places in Dublin, and I really will comeback to tasty All the menu!! The art on the coffee is SO CUTE I picked this place because of the reviews but after trying it I don t see why all of these positive reviews, at least for the things i have tried including the standard Irish breakfast, which was nothing special not fresh and pricey. The orange juice I ordered was from a Bottle. The beans didn t taste much, very small portion of bread. Pricey compared to other places and for its quality. The place inside is very tiny, it can accommodate only 8 people, so be ready to queue (which doesn t worth) you need to order at the bar even if you eat at the table. No napkins on the table. Service is poor but the people working there is friendly. Would recommend to give it try on your own but not worth the queue and the price. Lovely tiny wee coffee shop There are only 3 tables inside, place is tiny. We sat outside with ours, was very windy and cold. The coffee was delicious and the coffee art was amazing! My daughter got a muffin and it was very nice, I got a rolo cookie pie but unfortunately it was frozen so inedible. I did bag it for later, was ok just. Staff were very friendly and helpful Will definitely go back. Have visited here quite a few times. The most gluten free and vegan options for cakes/muffins I have ever seen!! Sandwiches and hot food also very good, veggie options too. And the coffee is incredible. Is very small inside the shop best to go when its quiet if you want to sit down. Great place victim of its success. We were lucky enough to got a table but its a really small shop with not that much seats and it can probably be tricky to eat or drink here on the weekend. Nevertheless I think that the Beanhive Coffee is a really nice place. The Irish breakfast and the super Irish breakfast were great, with good ingredients well cooked. The cappuccino and hot chocolate were also tasty and you can ask for coffee art for free. And what coffee art! We got a hippo and a girafe really well made and it was heartbreaking to drink our beverages since it was so cute... You only have to wait a tiny bit to have something really cool on your foam. The staff was also really nice and we enjoyed our time here. I just think that latte art aside, the wait for the meals was a little bit long. I think that it took 30 minutes for our breakfast to be made and it wasnt a problem since we had out beverages and wasnt in a hurry, but if you have an appointement of anything, I advise that you take the sandwiches since its faster to make. The price are really correct. It was 14  for an english breakfast+beverage and 16  for the super breakfast+beverage. Just try this place and you wont be disappointed! Edit: went to the Beanhive Coffee again (two days in a row... Im kinda hooked) and the chocolate art was magical again. The wrap was tasty but so generous I couldnt finish it (only ate half of it). I took it on takeaway thought. Nice street. Very nice place, friendly staff. I went for an Irish breakfast and finally I took a wrap ndeg7, very very good + art chocolate. He draws you a  surprise portrait  in the foam of your coffee or chocolate. I enjoyed my brunch. I recommend this place. Went there for breakfast once, kept coming back! Nice coffee with lovely art on request, amazing bakery, lots of good breakfast options. Very kind and nice staff. Worth waiting a few minutes for a table, its popular but not super crowded. Great coffee and food (it is a lot of food for one portion). It is nice and cozy! Family place with amazing breakfast options and cappuccino with cute latte art. I was surprised with the offer for breakfast/brunch options, the same as for everything that the place offers, considering that its very tiny. As the place becomes very easily filled, its possible that you wont get a table or that you will be standing in a line outside, waiting for some table to get free. Ordering happens at the counter. The place doesnt have a toilet, or at least it was closed at the time when I was visiting the place, so count with that in advance. Small but cozy cafe serving yummy food and coffee art! Lots of options for vegans (thank you)! Personally I like the wraps more than the Vegan Breakfast (mostly fries and salad). The coffee art is really cool to see :) The best choice of vegan food All of the meal required as vegan is availably . Boss is kindly as well Food : 5/5 There was a short queue when we arrived but with seating available both indoors and outdoors we didnt have to wait too long! Good menu range with fresh, high quality, and tasty dishes served quickly. Friendly and chilled atmosphere, reasonably priced for this part of Dublin! Would definitely return and recommend 1st and only place I ve tried Irish breakfast and definitely it was not disappointing. Whichever your taste, they can satisfy you. Large variety of pastry, excellent Irish breakfast, large assortment of Sorrenti kinds of coffe. We will come again! It was alright. The food was decent, ordered a standard Irish Breakfast and it was tasty (also very quick). However, it was a bit pricey and I felt cramped and rushed since the place is very small, with a queue of folks waiting. I also ordered a latte, again was decent but not anything memorable. A great place to stop by if you so happen to be in the area but not I would go out of my way for Friendly staff, great food and very well served coffee! the place could be a little bigger, with more space between one table and another, but its really nice to sit and enjoy a good coffee! Super cute cafe! Came here for the cute chocolate designs on their drinks and I was not disappointed! I also grabbed a chocolate hazelnut muffin and it was delicious! Not too sweet and not dry at all. Overall such a cute place to stop in and grab coffee! What a lovely cafe indeed! I popped in mainly for their coffee art that I had seen before. I asked them to make a   on my coffee. And what a cute and wonderful art they made! Absolutely loved it !!!! They also have tasty sweet and savoury snack options available."
10,Bewley's Grafton Street,4.525,"Lovely cakes, food, and coffee. Do check the menu before you go as they change the offering quite frequently, and your previous favourite may be gone by your next visit. Booking isnt usually needed, they will fit you in, and theres a little waiting area to sit in before you are seated at a table. Dietary restrictions: I have never had an issue here with managing allergies or restrictions. The staff are very accommodating. Parking: This street is pedestrian only. Kid-friendliness: My kids have always loved it here but they do have to sit and there isnt anything like a play area. There are usually children in the restaurant. Wheelchair accessibility: The ground floor is accessible and has plenty of seating, but the upper two floors are not. There is quite a lot of floor clutter to navigate, such as rope barriers. For the mobility impaired, the upper floors do have wide access, deep steps, and sturdy bannisters. Delicious coffee and delicious Mary Cake, with ice cream. Good advice by the happy and friendly staff. Highly recommended! Another day at Bewleys Grafton Street, and I had a delicious Caesar salad, a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, an incredible Apple Pie, everything with friendly staff (thanks to Luc today!) and a happy atmosphere. Thank you again! A charming, elegant place, one of the must visit places in Dublin, where you can enjoy a delicious scone and a coffee or tea. But its also a tasty breakfast or lunch or dinner.The staff is very nice, kind, benevolent, impeccable service! We felt wonderful, congratulations to everyone! The classic coffee house in Dublin. The decor, the ambiance is amazing. Their coffee and cakes are tasty too. We enjoyed to take a break there after walking around in the city. Dublin classic worth a look with the family . Decor and ambience is classic Dublin nostalgia for many locals. Service is prompt and friendly. Breakfast was average at the least , but the bakery viewing gallery downstairs is a treat for the kids. The high ceilings and stain glass make this place ideal for to meet with people visiting Dublin Don t change, keep it up Kid-friendliness: Very kid friendly, good crayon selection Had breakfast with friends who came a long way to visit Dublin this morning. I wouldn t call it good value, i.e.  17.50 for Full Irish Breakfast,  15.90 for Avocado Toast,  5.10 for Latte, and  4.40 for tea. But it s understandable, considering its premium location. However, the quality of our food was pretty disappointing, at least for our visit today. I m not sure if it is really  full  Irish breakfast when baked beans, mushrooms and hash browns were missing, and fried eggs were replaced by poached ones. You might argue it s a healthier option. But who would order full Irish breakfast in the first place, if he/she takes healthy eating as a priority? It is perfectly fine if boiled or steamed bacon/sausage were to be introduced in the future for those value good diet over taste, but I think at least the customer should have been given the opportunity to choose fried eggs if he/she prefers the traditional/classic way of Irish cooking. And the rashers of bacon were so dry and hard, and my friends had to send them back to the kitchen. Also the presentation of the dish has some room for improvement, for a premium price of  17.50. The picture says it all As per the attached photo, there was a very thin layer (not really much thicker than the butter spread you would put on a toast) of meshed avocado on the small and extremely dry sourdough bread. And it was topped with pickled onion slices, which I personally consider a strange combination and don t think it goes well with the taste and texture of avocado. The Latte was pretty good. And it should be, for the price of  5.10. The Irish breakfast tea was OK. The waiter was very kind and professional, for which I added a tip to my payment, even though the food was far below our expectations. The decoration and atmosphere were both great. Bewley s has a long history, a good brand and nice atmosphere, which for sure attracts and will keep attracting tourists. But I wouldn t go back for its food/drink, as there are far better options in its neighbourhood. This place is top notch! The service from entry to exit was very nice. No wonder why this place has survived and thrived for decades. Special shout out to the hostess. Highly recommend! Vegetarian options: Soup of the day was vegetarian the day I visited. But before ordering please check with the staff. If you want to spoil yourself and have high tea with your girlfriends then this is the perfect place. A bit on the pricey side but the food was delicious. The service is very good - everything comes out very fast and the people working here are very nice. The Harry Clarke stained glass murals are a great touch. I recommend making a reservation as it might be tough to get it and sit down given its popularity and the area. Located on the busy Grafton Street, the Brewley has a nice ambiance. Good place got coffee and brunch. Service is fast even though has to wait when busy lunch time. Had a flat white and cinnamon roll. it was just perfect! Faraj was great and made my experience there even better. Absolutely a must visit cafe. What a beautiful place to have our first meal in Dublin Ireland!!! The service was friendly and quick. The food quite delicious! And the decor and atmosphere were simply stunning!!! Mothers day gift of breakfast with family.  Great welcome efficient system to seat us. Lovely staff and atmosphere.  Full Irish breakfast was delicious  , avocado    and poached egg was nice enough could do with a bit more flavour. Childrens hot chocolate was served beautifully with cream chocolate chips and marshmallow s in separate dishes so children built their own toppings. This was a big hit. Children age 4&6 years.  Great for an occasion. Kid-friendliness: Crayons to colour pictures. Hot chocolate served very well children enjoyed this. Went there on Christmas eve to try the traditional Irish coffee. They apparently make the best Irish coffee in Dublin and I wasn t disappointed. It was a bit pricey but worth it considering the history of the place, the atmosphere and the service. It s also popular with the locals for its food although, I just tried the Irish coffee here. Must check it out when in Dublin. Love the Kids hot chocolate, I would recommend it if you are near and have been here twice with my family if you go to the bathroom you can see the bakery and my dad Vinicius Carvalho loves this place just like me, If you are traveling like me here is the best place to get a sweet Hello, I went for breakfast. I find the breakfast menu really limited. I ordered french toasts with bacon. The french toast were brioche and not bread with a too little moisture for my taste. And it came with a berries compote, and unfortunately I do not like this. I was disappointed because it was not written on the course description and kinda ruined my breakfast. When you pay 20 something euro for a breakfast and a coffee, you dont want to be let down. However, great atmosphere, superb environment, great staff The food is so good! The coffee is amazing, and the atmosphere is calm and perfect to enjoy. The most important thing is the treatment of the staff, really nice, comfortable and attentive. The server Pablo is great. Thank you for your attention. We stumbled upon here for breakfast and it certainly didnt disappoint. The food looks and tastes incredible! Highly recommend the full Irish breakfast, and the fruit scone! Even the lattes are fantastic Being naive tourists we had a few questions about the local area and our server couldnt have been more helpful. My Dad and I had coffee and pastries her and it exceeded expectations. The cakes were wonderful and the inside has breathtaking stained glass. The highlight above all else was the service. We had a wonderful time meeting Pablo this morning who was not only great with recommendations but was lovely to talk to. He set the mood high for the day and we felt very welcomed by his friendly and kind conversation. Thank you for such a lovely experience. The homemade granola was delicious and our server was so so sweet - I think her name was Carmen? Id been told though that this place is very beautiful inside with a great atmosphere but I didnt witness this, maybe its because we were sat on the 1st level love the deco and the design of this lovely place, full of warm hospitality feelings. the etmosphere was there when the first sight entering in the dining hall. food was deliciouse and the service was very proffesional. The soup of the day was great! You haven t been in Dublin if you haven t been to Bewley s. Saint Mary s cake has been lifting up folks since 1840 and everything else is classic comfort too. Our waiter Luke was great , friendly and humerus. The cake was delicious and had probably the best Irish coffee I have ever tasted Food Had the afternoon tea. All the items  savory and sweet were delicious. The service was excellent. Highly recommended. Had breakfast at Bewley s on a recent trip to Dublin. We ordered the Full Irish Breakfast and had a fruit scone, both of which were delicious. Service was great. Lovely place to grab breakfast/brunch. Pablo was our server. Service was excellent.  We were seated quickly by the window we wanted.  Pablo helped us order the perfect afternoon refreshments - coffee, gluten free brownie, sticky bun. Thank you Pablo! Came for breakfast, no waiting time. Staff was great, really lovely. Coffee was alright, not the best I ve had, the mocha had way too much chocolate in it. To eat, we both had the avocado sourdough which was nice! nothing amazing but still good. Will say the venue was beautifully decorated but it was really cold in there. It was nice but not sure I d go back. The building and staff are fantastic. Great ambiance there. The food is average for breakfast. Eggs are great. Price is where I think its unreasonable  17 for breakfast and that does not include your Tea Coffee. I paid  4.75 for black filter coffee on top of breakfast. That was hard to swallow. Brown Bread is exceptional. Its sweet. Loved it. Excellent place for vegan food and hot chocolate. Had the best  avocado toast In a very long time. The staff was super nice and accommodating. The wait was worth it! My kids loved the hot Chocolate Scone and Irish breakfast - both were done perfectly here. A place of history and remember to make a reservation before coming. We thought it was a restaurant but it was a fast flood. The food there was really mediocre... we were quite disappointed, which is a shame. But the staff was nice Extraordinary place. Quiet and nice atmosphere. All was incredibly delicious and well presented. Id like to dedicate a few words to the waitress that served us, Roger. His kindness and politeness was key in my experience. Moreover, he is handsome. If he sees this review, please text me. Id be delighted to date you. Good cheesecake Supper nice place, it s a must go if you are in Dublin. The coffee was also amazing. The scones and also all bakery are made in store so price is kind of justified. The scones should be on the must try list. The service of the staff is professional, they seemed proud to be working this place. There is many hidden places that are not open to public, however the store is full or art so it is kind of shame that patrons cannot have a look. However if I would live locally, I would definitely be a regular here. Vegetarian options: Everything is made in store so you can just take or add things to your food. A really nice place to come for a hot chocolate and a cake. The staff were very friendly and knew a lot about what was gluten free on the menu. Cakes were lovely and hot chocolates were presented beautifully! Recommend if you are visiting Dublin. Even though it s not the cheapest coffee in town, the old style coffee house in Bewley s, accompanied by the excellent service and top notch food would leave anyone chirping for joy. The fruit preserve that accompanies the fresh scones is sent straight from heaven. Always happy to pay a couple extra quid for the amazing atmosphere in Bewley s. Yes, you could save some money and just grab a coffee or even a take away, but why not splurge and immerse yourself in a Dublin icon? This bustling cafe has been in business for nearly 100 years, but the food is fresh and locally sourced.  My eggs, avo, rashers and toast were well (and quickly)  prepared. Service is pretty good, considering Sunday crowds, and my waitron tried to keep up and check in now and then. Best to book ahead on weekends and holidays, especially if you want a seat near the stunning Henry Clarke stained glass windows. Great place for traditional tea and coffee and cake all staff really helpful and friendly would definitely recommend a visit A lovely late lunch was a brilliant step into years past. We were treated like royalty, food was prompt, unique, delicious and fresh. Thank you for a wonderful experience. Very expensive place. We waited 20 minutes for a table for two people. We got a the Mary cake (very small and heavy) with a tea. The place is really beautiful and well cleaned. Not worth the price. Great service. Good food. Allergy accomodations. What an experience! Definitely worth the wait too! We only had to queue for 10-15 minutes before being ushered to a table in the restaurant area. Surrounded by a lovely decor including stained glass windows we were instantly greeted with the positive energy of our waitress. Orders were quickly made, and we opted for the Full Irish Breakfast, obviously. The plate is full, full of flavours including sausages, bacon, black and white pudding, poached eggs, grilled cherry tomatoes and their delicious soda bread. Add to that their creamy coffee and you are in for a ride for sure! Naturally we were tempted by the array of cakes they sell to and we had to ask for a box to take away with us a Tropical Meringue (Meringue, whipped cream, pineapple & passionfruit compote, prosecco syrup, passionfruit puree.) and a Strawberry & Elderflower Mousse (Wexford strawberry mousse, pain de genes, elderflower & sudachi gel.). We quickly ran back to the hotel to pack up before checking out, but we only checked out after we took the time to savour the two patisseries. Let me tell you: that mousse was AMAZING. And the compote of the tropical meringue to die for. They sure lived up to their reputation! Another place we will revisit next time we stop by Dublin!"
11,Big Bus Tours Dublin,4.9,"Jerry (Gerry?) was a GREAT driver!!!!  The bus takes you by many historical places and his commentary (and singing) was wonderful.  The other two drivers were okay.  Seats were small for a larger person. Staff were very helpful with my disabled husband.  If we werent so tired we would have ridden around a couple times just to be sure we saw everything.  This was a great way for us to do something productive while waiting to check into our hotel. Me and my husband just came back from Dublin and we got a 48hr ticket included the night tour. All the drivers we had were brilliant funny stories lots of information especially Robbie and Brian definitely recommend this bus tour. We did the whole tour then jumped on and off the rest of the time great service. It was incredibly helpful to experience all the sights of Dublin, especially when time was limited. The audio recordings provided clarity without being dull, and when we switched buses, Paul, our guide, was remarkably engaging, injecting humor while highlighting important landmarks worth stopping at. The app, which allowed us to track stops and schedules, proved invaluable in maximizing our visit to Dublin. I loved it!!! Yes, there is couple of details to improve but it doesnt take back the fact that I did enjoy it and Big Bus Dublin have a great Tours offer and have a really welcoming and friendly Drivers/Guides combination. Ali (Hop-on Hop-off knowledgeable driver), Jerry (Fabolous knowledgeable and fun Coastal driver), Ros (Fun and fresh speaker Night Tour) and Albert (Night Tour driver). 100% Recommended. Ross was an absolutely fantastic guide very knowledgeable and uproariously funny. Our driver Lee was also very professional and had a great report with the guide. We were gonna just ride the bus for a bit and hop off but once we heard Ross and his enthusiasm we had to ride the whole tour with him start at stop 1 and make sure you get Ross (Dont ask about Rachel) Incredible !!! We did the coastal tour , 40 min drive to the cliffs and then to the small village of Howth. During the stops you have time to explore the locations and take some nice pictures and eat something. Our tour guide Robbie and he was amazing and also very funny. Well deserved 5 stars review! By the way we used our Dublin pass from Go City We had a great time in the bus, especially with guides Alan and Brian who were brilliant. My wheelchair was accommodated and I rode for free, the stops were easy to find and if you download the app its very helpful. The only disappointment was that there is a long wait at stop one when changing over buses which was not explained when buying tickets and getting on at stop 7. The App was very helpful in determining when the next bus would come. Live guides. We were on 3 different buses. All of the buses were very clean. The guides were all very friendly,  efficient and safe drivers in very busy Dublin traffic. They were all very easy to understand.  The tour was only offered in English. The ticket is good for 24 hours. The map on the flyer was also very helpful. I took the tour with bigbus and it was fun. The driver was really funny and very informative. If you are short on time then this is the best way to see the major attractions in the city. You can hop on and off any where and it covers most of the good museums and the attractions. The museums are free in Ireland. And if you planning to go into one of the  major whisky distilleries then this is bus :->. We had an amazing, almost 4 hour tour to Howth, thanks to Gerry. His anecdotes were informative and very funny. We highly recommend this tour!! P.s thanks for the beautiful serenade Gerry, loved it! What a great way to see the city. The bus drops you right outside all the most interesting tourist attractions in Dublin. If you only have limited time in the city, the bus is the best way to get to see the citys best. And theres a twilight/night tour of the harbour, too. Good value. Thanks Brian for the night tour. Best way to see Dublin. Worth every cent and highly recommended especially if youre time limited and want to do and see as much as possible in a day. Staff were very kind and understanding. During the wait for the next bus, staff offered for us to sit on the top deck and take some photos on the display bus. Thank you Big Bus Dublin   will recommend to everyone I know. We only had a short time and so we decided to just do a round trip and not get off.  Our driver was Lee; he was amazing!  We were impressed that he drove and narrated.  He maneuvered the streets like a pro, especially when other cars and busses parked illegally, making the narrow streets even more narrow and harrowing.  Lee was hilarious, informative, and easy on the eyes.  He definitely was the star of our trip.  We now have a better idea of what to do on our next extended trip back here. Have given 5     but wish I could have given more. Our driver Gerry was an absolute hoot his patter was brilliant we enjoyed it so much we booked it the next day as well. If you do this tour make sure you get Gerry as it will make your trip. Thank you Gerry we love you and think you deserve a pay rise I was in Dublin a year ago and I was busy but found 2 hours to take this ride. My driver was Gerry, he was unbelievable. Very entertaining. Last Week my family was in Dublin and took the big bus again so my wife and kids can see Dublin. What a coincidence, Gerry was our driver again. This guy deserves a big raise. His honest comments and at the same time making sure he is not offending anyone in the bus. I really think no one should get offended as he is entertaining. Just like a stand up comedian. James was a fantastic guide! Very personable with every guest. He made personal connections with my girls and had so much knowledge. It was a glorious sunny day and we rode atop the open-air bus around Dublin. Due to time limitations we did the full circle and no  hopping . James our tour guide was amazing!! Such a great sense of humour and made sure to point out all the important highlights. Great way to tour around Dublin. Our driver/guide Jerry was superb, interspersing facts and humor while simultaneously navigating some tight streets. Absolutely wonderful tour of the city. Our bus driver was equally awesome and incredibly funny!!!!      . A full loop is about an hour and  a 1/2.  There are 25 stops and the brochure lays it all out. Definitely a MUST when visiting!!!!  Who knew the official color for Ireland is blue (pictured). I had the best experience of a life time joining the Big Bus night tour yesterday 7/10/2022 with driver Tony Perrin. A very kind hearted person with the BIGGEST SMILE! He went all the way to make sure me and my friend get to our destination even it s not part of his night tour shift. Great way to see Dublin and our driver Gerry was entertaining and extremely informative. Very bad traffic day in Dublin and he knew all the ways around it so we weren t sitting and not moving. Highly recommend. Tour driver, Robbie, did a great job. He shared good information with a bit of humor. For me, an American, he was easy to understand, which isnt always the case with some Irish accents. Well done, Robbie. I was looking for something to pass time in Dublin so decided to take a bus tour so I hopped on at oconnell Street dublin and done the whole tour without getting off and all I can say is absolutely Excellent!!!!! Driver (John) was amazing and he was both informing and entertaining from start to finish. Cant but praise the experience, best 90mins Ive spent in dublin. Highly highly recommended Had a tour with Jimmy who was fantastic. We were the last tour of the day and the only ones on the bus so it was like having a personal guide. His knowledge was great and he gave us local info and tips for our walk back home that evening. Added some humour to the info too. The route is great with most of the big attractions. Great way to discover Dublin in a few days. Jerry, our guide, was full of energy, told us multiple anecdotes about the different monuments and gave us tipps as well. Dublin Ireland had the best Big Bus Ive tried so far! They have live entertainment or commentary as well as the headset for different languages. But Ross and Jerry are absolutely hilarious to listen to throughout the tour and was honestly the best part!! Our tour guide, Albert, was lovely! I rode the bus with my family on a beautiful sunny day in Dublin, and we had a great time getting where we wanted to go with lots of history and local information shared with us along the way. :) Our tour was on Sunday 21st of Jan. Had the pleasure of Gerry being our first driver; very witty guy, had some great jokes and knew so much about Dublin. I don t know how he s able to drive and keep everyone engaged at the same time, great skill. Our second driver was David; he had some great knowledge of Dublin too so we learned twice as much in one day! Very professional and pleasant. Thanks to both lads from one of the mayo girls :-) Buses seem to be very hit and miss depending which driver you get. Some are great and really enjoyable. Drivers are very funny, witty and informative, others it s just a pre-recorded voice and nowhere near as good. We also weren t told that the bus we were on would not have a bus to follow the route on after the last stop and so when we got to the last stop we re told we had to get off (fair enough) but told there was no bus to carry us on and so were stranded on the opposite side of the city to where we needed to be. I understand the bus has to end somewhere and that they have to stop at some time also (Although was surprised as our ticket was valid for another hour) but was very annoying when it was pouring it down with rain and the driver was driving towards where we were going anyways, he didn t seem very empathetic or didn t seem to particularly enjoy his job. Enjoyed our tour of Dublin very much. Alan was knowledgeable and entertaining. The pick up and drop off times were on schedule both days we used the tour bus. We would recommend this company to others. Went in the costal tour to Howth and we had the best tour guide Ross. From start to finish he made us feel so welcome and made us laugh. Thank you so much and Robbie was a great driver too!!! What an absolutely brilliant tour. So many stops at points of interest, something for everyone. Our driver and tour guide ( Nial) was the funniest and most entertaining man. So much local knowledge and the Craic was hilarious  .  Highly recommended.  This guy deserves a medal   He certainly made our trip!! Really good value for money. Best big Bus tour we ever took! (and weve been on Big Busses all around the Globe) Jerry and his entertaining yet informative live commentary were a highlight of our trip to Dublin. The stops were well-chosen and the tour gave us a great overview of Dublin. Highly recommended! Thoroughly recommend the Big Bus Tour in Dublin. The guides are there with you (not recorded) and give lots of history and facts in a really engaging, amusing way with a big dose of Irish humour! Also a great route. I feel like I really lucked out by randomly choosing to do this night tour! I learned so much from the brilliant tour guide and the scenery was stunning from up high Gerry was such a great tour guide. We had him briefly the first day and wanted to make sure we got him again the next day because the tour was so much fun. We just completed his tour and his knowledge, enthusiasm and humour all rolled into one made it a very enjoyable and memorable experience. Cant believe that Viking site was covered in concrete! Thanks a lot Gerry and give this man a raise! Wade & Hollie, your Aussie friends from Perth We took the hop on/off bus in Dublin on the 30th of March 2024 with the driver/tour guide Albert. He is absolutely entertaining, well informed and pleasant that we decided to stay on the bus for the full 24 stops instead of hopping off! Well done Albert! We thoroughly enjoyed our day time tour yesterday with Robbie. His knowledge of the city was excellent and his humour was first class. Although a very cold day, we both leant a lot from the tour and we were kept informed about all the local attractions throughout. Well done Robbie; a first class service. The Big Bus Tours make it extremely easy to get around Dublin while also getting a brief but very well explained history of the city and the country as a whole. I highly recommend doing the Big Bus tour and if youre lucky enough to get on Rosss bus, youre in for a WONDERFUL time! Niall was our bus driver, wonderful personal touch as we drove the city with entertaining anecdotes. So nice to do a bus tour and not listen to a piped in recording, would highly recommend, hop on and off until you get Nialls bus."
12,Bite of Life,4.475,"This place is like a warm hug - the staff are so kind and welcoming. I felt a bit frazzled in Dublin, and the folks at Bite of Life put me at ease. I had the quiche and spinach salad twice for lunch! It was delicious, fresh, and clearly homemade. I ate here a total of 3 times on my trip, and I would definitely come back if I return to Dublin. It s clearly a favorite among the locals as well - people were popping to say hello. What a gem. Keep doing what you re doing, Bite of Life! Average breakfast place, average food. Eggs are cooked in microwave. Good coffee. Fast and efficient. Pricey for what it is. This is such a lovely find for a home cooked breakfast or lunch. We came for lunch, liked it so much, that we came back for breakfast the next day. The coffee is really good (best we ve had in Dublin), food feels healthy and is delicious, good hearty portions. The soup was just what we needed for lunch, then had the granola the next day. Very lovely staff and good service. Didn t try the cakes but all homemade by the owner and look delicious! Overall lovely place to sit and enjoy some wholesome food. If I lived here I d be in all the time. Vegetarian options: Loads to choose from - we are veggie Lots of great food options and attentive service. It was a perfect spot for a quick breakfast. Walking distance to Dublinia. Fast service. Sausage is dry though. Food Food and coffee not the greatest. Nice atmosphere but really tiny. Pricy for not so great food All-day breakfast is a wonderful option, my scrambled eggs with sausage and bacon were tasty, I also enjoyed a coffee and a freshly made juice. All the ladies running the store were very friendly and the prices are reasonable. I d be happy to come over again. Super cute little cafe! Super friendly staff and they do a great chai latte! Vegetable soup, chicken pesto sandwich, cappuccino, orange juice. I wish my stomach was bigger. All amazing! But the staff. Beautiful smile, so friendly. I can t say enough we enjoyed this little gem so much! Excellent experience. We got takeaway but the atmosphere is so good, and the staff really friendly. The food was amazing too! You have to try the fresh Dutch apple pie with cream made by the wonderful Dutch owner. Apples, cinnamon, and raisins; divinely delicious. Glad I returned after initially walking in and out. It was a staff members warm smile and positive energy that brought me back for an Americano made with love. Great little cafe for breakfast, very pleasant and intimate. Personally I succumbed to the scrambled eggs with homemade orange juice (real fruit!), and my partner for the porridge and a coffee. Well we were not disappointed Nice little place just minutes from St. Patrick s Cathedral. I stopped in before my visit there for a latte and its goat cheese and tomato panini sandwich. Really delicious. Very kind staff. Good people. We loved to stop by!! The sandwich, the soup, theapple pie were fantastic! We liked the juice too! Ad for the tea, it was one of the greatest Chai latte I drank! I recommend 100% this place! Good music too!! Food Discovered by chance with my partner during our trip to Dublin. I warmly recommend this place where the food and atmosphere are of high quality. We will come back ! Lovely little place with delicious ice-cream, smoothies and much more and lovely staff Brilliant, cosy and quirky eatery.  Real coal fire, upscale furniture and fantastic tasting food.  If I lived in Dublin Id be a regular.  With delicious looking super size quiche, bagles and toasties and yummy cakes, choosing was hard. Needing a boost I went with a super fresh smoothie of zingy carrot, apple and ginger.  Followed by piping hot tea and salmon, cream cheese and salad bagle, which came with a fresh slice of lemon.  Its the little touches that make places special. Really cool place next to St Patricks cathedral, the food is super good and there is plenty of choice, plus idk whos in charge of the music but they have good taste!! It is a bit small tho but apart from that perfection Very nice place, a warm welcome and food made to order. The break was very pleasant, I highly recommend. Excellent service and shop layout. Nice seating area and atmosphere. The breakfast was good quality. The coffee could have used some improvement, for an espresso it was very long, so a little watery (however, not bitter or sour in fairness). Overall, I would visit for a casual breakfast again. Absolutely amazing service, and delicious food. Loved the atmosphere, it warms your heart and belly visiting this place. Cheers Best location just down the street, half-way between the Christchurch and St. Patricks. Nice, cosy & savory!! Very ideal to take a break & refill, after exploring either church to procede to the other one. Very interesting little local joint, a nice break from gentrified fancy breakfast places all over Dublin.  Nice (family?) people and decent food. Food is super yummy, but they definitely deserve 5 stars because the service is class, all the girls were super nice, friendly and super helpful. Its worth a visit and if you cant stay, they do takeaway! Food Food was not bad, coffee was REALLY BAD, Sevice was worse. They forgot to take out my sandwich from oven, and it burnt... I saw they were trying to just cutting burnt part, so I asked to cook it again but they even didnt say sorry and said Just try it, it will be delicious I mean, it was their fault... Oh my god and coffee was really bad. Also I saw they were grabbing pastries a lot with their hands without washing I stumbled upon this place by chance and what a discovery appreciated. Its really cheap and the breakfast is scrumptious. The staff are lovely, its a very nice place to eat or have a hot drink. Came here for breakfast while visiting. Its a cute, fast, and friendly cafe. Super popular so it has people coming in and out fast, which is fun to watch. Loved sitting and hearing people order just the regular. Ordered a beetroot and cucumber juice, americano, and eggs and toast plate. All very fresh and came out quickly. Very Dubliner place, traditional Irish breakfast, small but welcoming! Cute shop, though small. If you want to eat in prices are about 1  more, otherwise you can take away for less - you can sit in the St. Patricks Garden across the street. I had the salmon bagel. Pretty good, though I wouldve put a bit of salt if I had it, and I think they should add more salmon. Located a stones throw from Saint Patricks Cathedral and the Hyatt Centric, ideal place for a breakfast or a break. Lovely staff and excellent food. Just called in for a sandwich between meetings. Very pleasent staff who prepared a lovely sandwich from a unusual selection of breads. You can sit in or take out. Note. There is a lovely public park beside the cafe so either in or out you should go and try out this cute little cafe. Not only the place is really nice and cozy but the staff is really charming and friendly. Definitely a place to visit/come back! Amazing cosy little cafe with a unique character. The food is delicious, reminds nannas home cooked food. Asked for a  3 americano. Would I like regular or large? Just a regular is fine thanks. And this is what I was handed. Show me anywhere in Dublin where this is a regular size coffee!!! Anywhere  Ill wait! Apparently their large coffee is what every other coffee shop in Dublin calls a regular. Server looked like it was a bother for her to serve people. Ill be posting this for all my coach driving colleagues who park beside this shop to see also. Ill be heading to daybreak across the road from now on for a regular coffee. Lovely place near St Patricks church. Good, coffee, good food and better staff. Nice and caring people that will make your day a little bit better. We really loved the music and the decorations too. Oh, and ask for the soup and sandwich offer, you wont regret!! Lovely staff and great coffee Great place with gluten free options. Amazing service and welcoming atmosphere Best for take away. Croissants and coffee. Eggs and sausage were ok. A  regular  coffee is served in a flat white cup, so it s tiny! For a  3.70 mocha only to be served in such a small cup isn t good value"
13,Bittersweet Cafe,4.55,"We went for breakfast after a long flight from Canada. The staff is super friendly! The food didnt disappoint either! We ordered the traditional Irish breakfast and salmon bagel which I loved. The sausages were different from the ones we have in Canada but tasty as well. The portions were big enough. We enjoyed our experience. Food:  ordered the 3 eggs omelet with bacon and fried onion,  the only downside to this dish is the onion is big slices and not bits of pieces like the bacon as you didnt even try to cut the onion into this dish.  So either ask without the onion or ask for fine diced when ordering the portions are decent, but again need to be aware of the preparation method. Service: As for time from order to table was fast and efficient as known who ordered what. Atmosphere: The music was a bit too loud was hard to make a conversation at times. And chairs, not the coziest can be better if change the chair and adjust the music tone. The legends are true. Bittersweet Cafe is home of the best pancakes in Dublin ( or even in Ireland!). Food is amazing, portion sizes are pretty big, lovely atmosphere. And the staffs really do look after everyone! First time I was in the place I didnt have a good vibe. Even though I work couple of doors there, I went to get a coffee in winter the customer service was not good the staff was gossiping in Spanish, it was very unprofessional. I did not returned there since. But my co-worker wants to have some food there because it was close to us. The customer service is still very dry, no smiles, nothing. But the salmon sandwich and salad was amazing, absolutely great presentation in a very beautiful place, they also have nice teas. It was so good that I returned again 2 days after. I think I found my new favourite spot. They would be more famous if they staff have some customer service training or they could hire some outgoing ones. At the moment it looks like they are under pressure is something. This is the first place that we visit right after we arrive Dublin. We went for breakfast and we were all happy with our choices, and their coffee is very good as well. We left with a full and happy tummy. Cheerful wee caf thats open and serving good grub bright and early so if you get a flight into Dublin Airport at an ungodly hour its the place to head to if you want a good breakfast and proper coffee in a central location. Reasonable prices and very generous portions. Plus very friendly staff. The cakes and pies look excellent. Best place for a full Irish and the sausage rolls are impossible to beat. Hands down best breakfast place in Dublin. Our day kicked off on a high note with a delightful breakfast at this charming cafe. The reasonably priced Irish breakfast was a fantastic start, and despite the indoor seating being full, our luck with the Irish weather allowed us to enjoy our meal outdoors. Sitting in adorable chairs by the road, sipping warm coffee, and relishing the amazing food set the tone for a perfect day. The friendly staff added to the positive vibes, making it a 5-star way to begin our day. Good coffee. Nice selection of pastries but not the best we ve tried. Cute little cafe on an old Dublin street. Got all the vibes. This is not going to be a great review because mistakes were made! Partly by me, but also by the people running the cafe. There is a saying about sticking to what you are good at. So, if you are looking for an Irish breakfast, as I was, I shouldnt have walked in to an Italian cafe and expected to find one. And hear in lies the problem. Bittersweet cannot, right now,  produce a decent Irish Breakfast, but their coffee and pastries are excellent. My wife had pancakes and whipped cream with maple syrup with walnuts too, which were fantastic. I learnt a lesson and wont make the same mistake again. Sorry guys, but as far as the full Irish was concerned both the white and black puddings were hard, the fried egg was crispy and the sausages poor quality and no mushrooms. The other stuff looked great, but the key message here is stick to what you are good at. So delicious and the staff was wonderful.  Thanks so much for feeding us so well during our first visit to beautiful Ireland! Yum!!! My husband and I just visited Dublin for the first time and fortunately ended up trying Bittersweet Cafe due to its proximity to our hotel. After one visit we ended up having this cafe for breakfast each morning- it was just too good to try anything else! I absolutely loved the amaretto latte, it was perfectly smooth and not overbearingly sweet. The Breakfast Bap sandwich is absolutely delicious; every flavor youd want in an Irish breakfast on a perfect brioche bun. We also loved their treats like the house made Strawberry Tart and Lemon Poppyseed Slice. Im sure the rest of the menu is just as tasty. The perfect place to start your day! We enjoyed a delicious, full Irish breakfast. After a breakfast like that, youre good to go. You get a lot of value for your money. The coffee was very good and there is a nice, friendly atmosphere. Im reviewing this cafe three months after visiting Dublin because I cant stop thinking about the porridge! My friends and family are most likely tired of hearing about it, but I would honestly (and with no exaggeration) fly from the US to Ireland again for the porridge. I hope to go back someday. It was creamy enough not to need any embellishment, but the pour your own maple syrup added JUST the right (small) amount of sweetness. Perfection, and the hot chocolate was good too. The scones were kinda hard but I think that was because we went in the afternoon inatead of the morning. Service was good though, friendly staff. What a nice cafe! I was looking for a place which offered not only full Irish but a bunch of other options for breakfast (sandwiches/bagels, omelets, pastries, etc) and this coffee did not disappoint. There was a great selection of morning pastries, a fairly extensive menu with several options for everyone, and a big drink menu too. I got the full Irish with a double espresso. Everything was good, served fast and prices were fair for such a location. Highly recommend! Really great service and tasty pastries. I appreciate that they are open later and that they offer a variety of speciality coffees, pastries, and food options. The hospitality of the staff is unmatched! Highly recommend! Our family of 7 (2 adults, 5 kids) went here on a Sunday morning. My 7 year old had researched the best pancakes in Dublin and really wanted to try here. He is a bit of a pancake expert and he was not disappointed! Beautiful, fluffy, loads on the plate. Just fantastic. We tried the pancakes with chocolate sauce, with maple syrup and with bananas. All brilliant. A few of us also tried the cinnamon French toast which was yummy. Eldest son tried the Irish breakfast and was suitably impressed. With soft drinks for the smaller 3, and 3 coffees for the olders, the bill (including tip) came to  125. Very good value in my opinion. We were stuffed and happy. The staff were brilliant and whoever is running the sounds in the backgrounds has it down. Well worth a visit on the way to Christchurch cathedral! Today I decided to take a walk around the city in the morning and I was lucky enough to find this delicious cafe along the way! The staff was very attentive and friendly, in addition to the sandwich that was delicious. The cappuccino was also creamy and served with a bit of powdered chocolate which I love. I cant wait to come back to try the rest of the other options they offer, I highly recommend it! Very small but very tasty spot for a full Irish Breakfast... Or a salmon and avocado bagel if thats more your thing. Coffee is big.. I mean their small coffee is big a large would have you wired for two days An amazing breakfast with great drinks. Small and unassuming but perfect to sit outside and enjoy! The spiced milked steamer was excellent. We were going to Christchurch Cathedral for a tour. We wanted to get breakfast. We found The Bittersweet Cafe across the road. We started off with Red Berries and Ginger lattes which were delicious. I got the full Irish Breakfast. It was very good. This place is a great place for breakfast and brunch. They do everything! We ordered the breakfast through a delivery app and they were very quick. The Irish breakfast that they do is fantastic and arrived hot. Very friendly staff. I dont have anything negative to say about Bittersweet Cafe. I highly recommend this place! My first meal in Dublin and I loved it.  Got the full Irish breakfast and it did not disappoint. Ive got a full belly and Im ready to walk and pub hop.  Small place and is busy, but I highly recommend if you are visiting from out of town and need a quick and yummy breakfast. Ill probably eat here every morning Im here. The fact that this place doesnt have a line out the door is shocking. This place has what maybe the best pancakes ever created. Super fluffy with a slightly  crisp exterior and full of flavor. And their brownies are just ridiculously good, served warm with whipped cream on the side. Drawn in by the smell whilst going on an early morning exploration of Dublin, went with the scrambled eggs on toast with bacon and onions, holy moly this is some of the best breakfast Ive had in a while Friendly staff, mid range price, would go again for sure. Food A single sausage roll is 5.90 on deliveroo. Im not one to care about the cost of food really but I have never in my life seen a rip off comparable to that. Nice little cafe with good coffee and food selection. We had the soup of the day, which was tasty, plus a few other sandwiches, all good. The staff was very nice and professional. About the previous reviewer, who gave one star, just because you need to be vaccinated to sit down inside: it is not the places decision to do that and simply underrating them based on this is very childish... This is a nice place and they deserve more customers :) Very good cuisine. The room is a bit small. The service is good. The coffee was good, probably better than other places with a fair price. The sausage roll was tasty (nice touch to give some sauce with it), quite big. There are many different options, not just some pastries if you want to try. Its a very crowded but very beautiful place. The atmosphere is excellent. I also think the food tastes very good and the service is fast. Vegetarian options: vegetarian food looked pretty good Awesome cafe! My husband and I visited it before beginning a tour to Glendalough! Great coffee and breakfast choices! Service was very friendly. Nice cafe. Brilliant opening times. 7am on Saturday. Nice Irish breakfast quality products. Must be at  15 for an Irish.  Coffee brings to  19.80.  Dearer than the airport. Maybe it is city centre price, who knows. Lively cafe. sound garden on PA. Times good Pricey. Its a nice place, however, the vegan sausage roll is much smaller than the meat one (see pics) for the same price which isnt really justified. Lovely place for a quick bite to eat and a good coffee. Good selection of wraps, paninis and cakes. All day breakfast available and all serves by v friendly staff. Small inside so can be busy at certain times of the day. Stopped here twice during our short trip to Dublin. The staff were very patient and kind with us Canadians but service was quick. I still think about the omelette I had from here and the pancakes were incredible as well! 5/5 would recommend. They are open an hour or more before other coffee shops in the area so we stopped in.  It was a great choice, good service, wonderful coffee and a nice breakfast. We wanted to finish off our trip to Ireland by trying the famous Irish Breakfast... Although the staff are friendly and working  hard to fill their deliveroo orders, dont let this cosy looking cafe lure you in for breakfast. The food was disgusting. Luckily it was a small portion... In the first bite of her undercooked hash brown my wife enjoyed a lump of blueroll, followed by undercooked eggs and every item was way too salty. The full Irish, what a disgrace to the name of this dish. I hope we get to come back to Ireland another time to give it a second chance. My egg was burnt, the sausages the cheapest and mushiest Ive ever experienced. Two measly 50cent size morcels of white/black pudding, a single undercooked hash brown (probably would have been made better by a slice of washcloth) and luke warm watery & salty beans. The staff were okay though. Besides ordering a white americano and receiving a flat white 15 mins later 39 for the privilege The best cafe in Dublin!! Amazing breakfast, coffees and smoothies. I love Bittersweet cafe!  Roasted veg with brie cheese ciabatta & scrambled egg on ciabatta is my favourite! Lovely little cafe . Food was excellent who knew how delicious scrambled egg bacon and fried onions could be. All washed down with a lot of tea . Staff friendly and welcoming . Will definitely return when back in the city"
14,Blas Cafe,4.65,"Big space. Order at the counter, youll be given a beeper to take with you at your table, when food is ready the beeper will go off and youll collect your food from the counter. The atmosphere is hipster, their brunches are quite good and the soup of the day was exquisite! To improve; bread and cleaning standards. Great space for brunch. Food An ideal space to have breakfast or lunch,  to meet up with friends for a cup of really good coffee black as midnight on a moonless night. Many people come there to work, read or study, a very pleasant atmosphere,  loads of space. Delicious food ( not always possible to eat it esthetically, but much fun!) A favourite place in Dublin. A beautiful cafe to hangout with your friends or get your work done. It s lovely inside. A nice study spot for students. Love the coffee! Lovely staff, delicious food, spacious sitting area and central location! Will be back for weekend brunch as recommended by my friends Really enjoyed the food and I love tea made from leaves. The prices are not bad and staff super  friendly. Place is a bit noisy as its very bare and the high ceilings, very industrial looking with it white wall. The small tea cups are not great your tea goes cold very quick. A nice big mug would work better. But will return to try more of their menu.And its dog friendly as well. Absolutely lovely place! A bit hidden, beautiful inside   Definitely perfect place for everyone who wants a little quiet time also lpts of space for mommas and babies     love this place! Delicious food and coffee! Perfect place for large groups. Most of the places around the city centre are too small, and here you can have lunch and enjoy some board games with friends. Another great point is that you can order and pay individually, which makes it easier when you have to go. The price is totally fair, the food is delightful. The waiting time is minimal. We relished our visit. Great place tucked away, more space to sit and relax than expected. Solid coffee and small menu Good breakfast (big) I recommend taking the  The plate  it was a kind of sandwich with eggs and bacon. The interior is nicer than the exterior beautiful cafe with yummy food. It can almost be invisible in the heart of Dublin. We got pancakes with yoghurt and strawberry, Avocado toast with poached eggs.Absolutely yummy. Our little girl also had some nibbles from the pancake. Chill space, good food, fair prices. Standout points include: iced lattes, a row of repurposed school desk/bench near the entrance making for a fun dining experience, a little shop in a corner of the cafe, being dog friendly. Located in what feels like a rougher part of town but worth the trip for this underrated brunch spot. Cool and spacious venue, with little decor but great character, lovely food and varied menu options. Totally recommended We have been in Dublin for 7 days now from Australia and everyday we have been searching for the best coffee and breakfast/brunch. Well we found it! When I say we have tried alot of cafes and coffee shops in our search in Dublin, I mean we have searched ! Multiple coffees a day in hope to find one.  Blas hands down is the best coffee. Smooth and creamy. The perfect blend of flavours and consistency a flat white should have. Our only disappointment is that we found them on our last day! The food! My gosh! I had the Marrakesh breakfast and it was divine. Full of flavour. I was also impressed as we are travelling with 3 kids, the staff let us know that they can pretty much make anything the kids would like. This made my kids very happy! My youngest able to get just a plain porridge and My middle able to get her craving fill of a bacon and eggs roll (Bap) Very very happy we stumbled on this place!! Thanks Team!!! Really good value with delicious food. The place itself is really well set up and the staff were very friendly Wow, this place has definitely improved since my last visit! I ordered the same dish: avocado on toast with poached eggs, and to my surprise, theyve added some roasted potatoes with sage on the side (delicious  ), which definitely made a difference! Very reasonable portions, amazing value for price, delicious coffee and vegan options. The atmosphere is one of the best points in this place, alternative, eclectic, very bright and comfy, loads of space and a very cool multipurpose space, with even an art and craft shop inside! Finally, the staff are very attentive and theyve also improved the waiting time since my last visit. All in all, still one of my favs in Dublin Quite excellent food. Its a good open plan networking space that is very chill. With out a few souls in there it might be a bit empty feeling but in general good creative atmosphere Very nice atmosphere and staff is lovely but the food isnt good and quite pricey for what it is. My gosh. What a treasure of a find. The Best Coffee in Dublin. By far!  We are from Australia. We have been to London and Edinburgh. This is the  best breakfast we have had in the last 3 weeks! Only sad thing is it took us 5 days to find this place and we leave tomorrow. Kid-friendliness: Even the kids ate all their food! Blas always has the most delicious meals and fabulous coffees every time. The cowboy breakfast on the brunch menu is brilliant if youre looking for a big breakfast. They do a lot of pastries/brownies/etc. and have recently started making vegan cheesecake which is to die for! Always recommend this place <3 (pancakes and veggie bean burger pictured) Blas has improved a lot over the last two years. The food is very good, and the coffee is lovely. The current staff are very friendly. The atmosphere is great with good music playing at the Goldilocks level. Would recommend Blas for an afternoon brunch or just a quick coffee What a find. A hive of busyness behind the counter. Chickens being roasted, soups being made, my superb Chicken Chipotle Sourdough being constructed... Small tables for two, community tables for 8, and everything in between, plus some comfy winged chairs for good measure. Huge windows, cool light fixtures, nice art, excellent food, and most importantly, great coffee. Reasonably priced too with some combo options which is great if you include soup on a cold November day. Second visit in three days. It could be come a habit... I got the halloumi burger and it was simply delicious! Staff super helpful, I enquired whether another option once was spicy and they referred me to something else instead. They also offered me a student discount before I ever asked. Lovely atmosphere if you wanted to go with friends or on your own. Will definitely be returning! Off the beaten track, so glad we found Blas Cafe. Breakfast was delicious and fresh and a superb cappuccino - thank you Charming place with great food and really friendly staff. Had the huevos rancheros for brunch and a freshly squeezed blood orange juice, both really good. I was looking for a tasty breakfast in the North inner city and this place wins hands down! Homemade baked beans, 2 poached eggs, jumbo sausage (no sniggering down the back!), bacon, sourdough toast, fried potatoes and even some rocket to fool yourself into thinking youre eating healthily, all for a tenner! Plus a bright, airy space that doesnt leave you feeling youre eavesdropping on your neighbours conversation, or vice versa. Also the coffees great! Nothing to not like. Spaciuos, independent, relaxed vibe. Keffir brew incredible. Cool staff. Hipster. No barista BS. Best coffee shop in Dublin. Great place for a quick bite to eat and drink. Food was great and service with a smile even better I was the only customer in the queue early Monday morning after dropping my son to Bolton St college. There were maybe 4 other customers sitting down. The place was practically empty. The tall blond server at the coffee machine could not have radiated more disinterest in my custom. She oozed am I bovvered energy. I had 2 questions. 1) Could I have an americano. 2) Is the wifi good? Even though she was the only one behind the counter she told me to move 2ft further down the counter to ask for coffee. She ignored my wifi question until I repeated it. Once I stood in the exact coffee ordering spot , she asked what I wanted without making eye contact. I said I already told her over at the coffee machine. Anyway I got sick of her sub/dom game and saved my money and parking fees and went home. Fantastic place and had excellent food. Hardy recommended!!! Lovely place to relax on a Saturday, great coffee, pastries + food all hand made. Friendly + a hipster place to meet up. The 2nd Saturday Market is held there. The BLAS CAFE is in the old Chocolate Factory, Kings Inn St. D2. First time here, myself and my partner drive by it a lot so we decided to have a look, react place to meet up for a chat nice nd quiet not to loud, lunch was amazing and staff very friendly tea was with tea leaves but the cups where a bit tiny s u couldnt really hold the properly but overall love it will definitely return again Very delicious pastries, I did not like the Cappuccino. The Ambiente ist that of a factory and thats intended. Great , healthy food . Warm , nice atmosphere . Definitely will be back Kind of a hippy place with wonderful decoration, peaceful ambiance Best brunch in town !!! 10-15 e for a biiiiig plate Food is AMAZING Try it, trust me Good food options for lunch albeit a little slow if youre rushing. Simple healthy food. Its located at back of Cineworld off Parnell Street in D1. Not too expensive. Amazing brunch place! Very spacious, delicious food, and good coffee! Such a hypstery place. Strongly recommend! Friendly welcoming staff, delicious food prepared with love! We were visiting the 14th St. Henrietta Museum and looking for a place nearby with some healthy options. This was the perfect choice!  The owner and staff are extremely friendly, and the food is really tasty!  I had the best gluten free brownie that Ive ever tasted, and I love to bake myself!  The atmosphere is great, and they have a lovely selection to choose from for lunch. I would highly recommend you try this little cafe! Excellent food and service. Best beef I ever tastef. But cold temperatures ; we had to keep coats on most of the time."
15,Blessington Street Basin,4.775,"Amazing small place to have a rest, read or have a small picnic. It had shade, an amazing view. Its not in the most amazing neighborhood but nobody bothered us Very nice place, quiet in the evening, perfect for a little walk to see the birds without fear. Beautiful little park and lake in the Phibsborough area of Dublin. Its well maintained and a real haven for wildlife. Theres a pretty little gate lodge at the main entrance to the park. Marvelous park! It s so relaxing the sound of water so peaceful! Different kinds of birds and trees around! It s nice for a walk or just to sit down and read a book or just watch the birds and water! Loved it! Sweet little park. If you are in this area, definitely pop in to see the flowers. The plants are all blooming for spring already and the ducks are fun to watch. The walled garden is just a nice place to visit and obviously well loved. Lovely little space to spend your lunch break in. You wouldnt know you were in the city once in here. It is so peaceful. It was lovely to see the family of swans,various ducks and the big bird, is it a heron? not sure, and plenty of gicknahs(pigeons). Lovely little path around a water reservoir with the sound of fountains, quacking of ducks n ducklings. 1 lap of the path is 400m; 5 laps makes 2km; 10 laps-4km. Benches along the path, paintings on the stone walls, little fairy doors, swans in the water, colourful flowering shrubs all around, little bronze sculpture in the walls Always beautiful regardless of the weather. Maintained by creative hardworking friendly staff. And a bird sanctuary right here in town. Then theres one of those posh markets on Fridays. Lovely buzz about the place. I love this little park, a hidden gem amongst the concrete jungle of Dublin. There is a huge amount of wildlife for such a small place and it s quite beautiful! The park is small, but it has a childrens playground and a basketball/football court. Like the basin, this is a great place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city. You can almost walk all the way to Phibsborough road without having to cross the road. The basin is a very welcoming green space full of life and away from traffic. Local and migratory birds spend time in the basin, and neighbours walk through or soak up the sun on good days. Well looked after, specially in spring and summer months. The attached pics are from January. Great place for relax. My wife and I walked through the Blessington Street Park (The Basin) to get to another touristy location.  We saw many people walking through the park to get to work; children lead by their teachers through the park towards a playground.  A few people stopped to relax with their coffee and read something on their phone.  The Blessington Street Park (The Basin) is worth a visit to relax and enjoy the wildlife. This small but beautiful pond was a reservoir for Dublin city that supplied homes until 1885, then Powers & Jamesons distilleries until the 1970s. An artificial island has been developed in the centre to create a refuge for the ducks and swans and other birds that use it. Its quite small but here is a lovely fountain and small decorations everywhere to catch the eye. Gorgeous little hidden gem of a park, I just wish there werent groups of men drinking alcohol there all the time . Such a peaceful experience over all! There are unsavory elements haning around. They are however, easily avoidable. If you enter from the main gate and choose to turn left instead of right most of those unsavory elements seem to stay in the right side of the park. They are also few in number. Blessington Park is very well maintained. You can see some ducks and swans in the pod. There are two fountains to enjoy and hopefully the little Caf  is open now from the 19th of July 2021. Coz COVID. There is also an exit to a green structured like a lane with massive trees, benches and grass to enjoy some nature in and calm your soul. I will be frequenting this spot to get some writing done. A beautiful little place with a walkway surrounding a small pond with ducks and a few swans. The place is perfect for a evening stroll or a quiet read beside the water. Small and cute park to spend time. Quiet and neat Very atmospheric park! Everyone will find their favorite place to relax. Dont forget to bring duck food! Beautiful little park, very well maintained, brongs a dash of colour to an otherwise grey area of the north inner city There was a wonderful selection of spring flowers including daffodils and crocuses, I could smell the hyacinths from the bottom of Blessington street. Always lovely for a walk on a sunny afternoon Small but beautiful park with a lake. There are swans, ducks and other birds in wild environment. The park allow feed the animals (only specific food such corn,oath and bird grains) so its a great experience for children. An absolute hidden gem.  Not very crowded and very beautifully maintained. There are good few nice cafes around as well. Specially two boys brew.  Definitely worth checking ! I used to walk through here every morning on my way to work and it acted like a tonic to help me face the day. Two more water sprays have been added so it is even more soothing now to sit and unwind. Quite a nice place... That I wanted to leave asap. Lovely, Sat Down In The Sun, Reading The Paper And Feeding The Ducks. Nice place to get some rest...especially on a sunny day.. There is a lot of ducks swinning peacefully in the water and a small island with bushy trees just in the middle of it. There  are benches for sitting and resting Lovely calming and relaxing little oasis in the middle of the city.. Wel maintained and lots of lovely bird wildlife.. Spoke briefly  to one of the guys who maintaines the bacin.. Very nice guy seems to know about his plants also Beautiful Oasis. I just love this little place, wonderful to stroll or just sit & listen. Splendid and well spent quality time on a sunny day Lovely park in Dublin, I sit here for a few minutes while Im walking through every week before my course. A beautiful park, not that far away from the city center. Such a beautiful place to relax in the middle of the center!!! Beautiful who ever works on this goes above and beyond every turn a different flower or something Secret garden of aquatic birds complete with island and 3 fountains and a very Quaint Park-Keepers home. I didnt find a coffee or ice cream (bird food?) shop but there may be one, if not, it could do with one, possibly in conjunction with an open house of the beautiful cottage? Of the most serene birthday afternoons ever! Beautiful place for walk and lunch Its a lovely place to go to just to forget the reality Lovely Park in the busy neighborhood Great Park to chill out for a few or kill time while wait for an appointment Cute wee park great for take away coffee catch-ups. Small little haven for birdlife within the city scape."
16,Brendan's Cafe,4.8,"What a tasty fry! A proper old school greasy spoon. Well worth a visit, this breakfast will set you up for the day. The staff were very friendly and I am looking forward to going back. If you have a lot of time for breakfast and are not very hungry, its a nice place to see local people. The food is nothing fancy but carefully prepared by Brendan himself. The cafe is right in the middle of the wholesale fruit & vegetable market, so it will be very busy after 9 or 10 when morning workers just finish their work. I waited around 55 minutes for my small breakfast (EUR 11). Maybe its better to go there very early or after 11:30. Incredible home cooked diner. Fantastic irish breakfast   with lots of items. Great location and fresh food. Brendans Cafe in Dublin, Ireland, has quickly become my favorite spot to indulge in a delightful breakfast or lunch. From the moment you step inside, the warm and inviting atmosphere immediately sets the stage for a memorable dining experience. The standout feature of Brendans Cafe is undoubtedly their chunky fried potatoes. These golden nuggets of deliciousness are a culinary masterpiece. The perfect combination of crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, they are a must-try for anyone visiting. Its not an exaggeration to say that Brendans has perfected the art of crafting the most scrumptious fried potatoes in Dublin. What truly elevates Brendans Cafe is the exceptional hospitality provided by the staff. The people running the shop are not just excellent at what they do; they are also incredibly friendly. From the moment you walk in, they make you feel like a regular, even if its your first time there. The welcoming atmosphere adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the dining experience. The menu at Brendans is a testament to their commitment to great food. The fry-ups are a particular highlight, with each component cooked to perfection. The balance of flavors and textures in every dish is a testament to the culinary expertise of the kitchen. Pairing their fantastic food with a cup of tea is a match made in heaven. The tea is brewed to perfection and complements the meal beautifully, especially when enjoyed with their freshly toasted bread. Its evident that attention to detail is a top priority at Brendans Cafe. In conclusion, Brendans Cafe has won my heart as the go-to place for breakfast or lunch in Dublin. The combination of exceptional food, friendly staff, and a welcoming ambiance make it a standout destination in the citys culinary scene. If youre in Dublin and havent experienced the joy of Brendans Cafe, youre missing out on a true gem. A month after my trip to Dublin I still remember this pretty little place. Brandon is friendly and the Irish breakfast (although I went there in the afternoon) is very traditional. I have a feeling that people may come and go in this community but Brandons cafe is always there just like another home. I would definitely revisit if I go to Dublin again and 100% recommend to people who are planning to visit Jameson (which is not far away) come and enjoy the brunch  . Brendan s Cafe was a perfect start to my adventures in Dublin. The atmosphere is home like and unpretentious. It has a diner vibe and the food is great. The large breakfast was totally worth it and perhaps a bit much to start the day. The staff is friendly and many locals visit this place. This was the real deal.. do yourselves a favor and get out of the tourist district to try this little gem. Brendan himself served up our brekkie and we also lucked out and got a ton of amazing travel tips from another local who was there grabbing a bite. What a treat! Nice people! Saw a lot of locals eating there. We got the cheeseburger. It came with chips. The burger was pretty good and the chips were good (just added a bit of salt). Had a hard time finding a place that people were massively recommending in Dublin for Irish Breakfast, then I saw a couple people mentioning Brendan s Cafe. Went there and it did not disappoint: the place looked a bit out of time and old school, food was filling and so cheap and service excellent. I got the large breakfast with coffee, wife went for the medium breakfast with coffee. Large comes with fried egg, sausage, white&black pudding, bacon, potatoes, tomato, 3 slices of buttered toast and mushrooms. There s also complimentary orange juice and a huge jug of milk for those who like it in their coffee. Frankly a super pleasant discovery. Great Irish breakfast. Love the atmosphere and the staff is wonderful. I m not sure if the owner is Brendan, but the gentleman in the restaurant was very kind. Give it a try. Just off the boat in North Wall Dublin town back from a trip of a lifetime to the RWC in France. I followed a well worn route for me and lots of other truck drivers from back in the early 90s loaded with fruit or veg for the market. Brendans is a staple for everyone working in, delivering to or living locally and has been for years. I had a great chat with Brendan catching up on some great stories and memories. If you want a hearty breakfast or just a cuppa then this is the place to go, keep up the good work! Probably the best Irish Breakfast in Dublin. Traditional, authentic and for the best price ever! Lovely people and it feels so cosy, a must try !! Happened upon this cafe on the way to the Jamison tour.  Great food, prompt service, and good value. As old School Classic as they come ..Always Reliable to serve up  Tasty Fresh and well presented taste of the old Dublin Fry Up .. Wonderful meal, I appreciate a place that has Jimmy Buffets song Margaritaville playing when I entered. Proper no frills breakfast venue. Hearty, well Made and good quality grub. Friendly, genuine service. Food I love love love Brendans. No nonsense Olds Chool cafe. On Mary s Lane in the heart of the fruit markets. It is a diamond of a place. Specialising in batch bread on the side of its mouth-watering fry. It s open early in the morning and closes early in the afternoon, so get it while you can. Great quality, price and people Food Just have eaten here. AMAZING. Best Irish breakfast, lovely staff, good price and local place. If you are a tourist looking for the real Irish food and you are tired of eating in foods chains....this is your place. Thanks you. If I come back to Dublin I now where to go. One Americans opinion. Stopped in at 6Am on a Tuesday morning. Last day of my 8 day stay in Ireland. Brendan opened up and cooked me a small Irish breakfast. I regretted not finding more places like this in Dublin. Several workers stopped in and knew Brendan by name. He slid them a couple of sausages and what looked like regular small orders. The other joints I visited were fine but too fancy for my taste. Brendan s was a small hole in the wall with no fuss, no obnoxious music blasting. No foamy designs in the coffee. Just good food and a friendly hard working owner. If I ever return, I ll head to Brendans. Best cafe in the city by far, none of your avocado on toast here, just a proper good fry up with batch bread, perfect spot for a breakfast. The best coffee in my opinion . Great taste  . Great breakfast. Food Honestly one of the worst breakfasts I ve ever had. I don t know what happened, I assume this place must have at one point been good given the other reviews on here, but we were just served the cheapest possible overcooked eggs, bread etc. with no care or love whatsoever put in and charged a fortune, more than I ve seen advertised at nicer looking expensive places   not expecting the world at a greasy spoon, but I ve been to many and this takes the brown nobbly biscuit for the worst I ve ever eaten at   for only marginally more we got a swanky brunch elsewhere yesterday. If we had any spine at all I would have told them what I really thought of their overpriced tasteless effortless food, but English politeness (cowardice) dictated I should wait and do it here. I never normally do reviews and I m sorry to be so harsh but seriously, something needs to change. I truly believe in the institution of the cheapo breakfast cafe and its place in this increasingly expensive world, so I want this place to be good   either lower your prices (to be honest for what we got anything more than a couple of euros is an insult) or find something to believe in about the greasy spoon and make some kind of effort because this ain t what it s supposed to be. I ve never been more ticked off by a morning meal. The best place to get breakfast in Dublin, hands down. The staff is lovely and helpful, they will make sure you have everything you need to enjoy their magnificent breakfast. What s even better is the prices, nothing is too expensive. Anytime I have people visiting from abroad this is my go to place to take them, and they all absolutely love it. Nice place in front of the great and beautiful (but abandoned) fruit market. Good place for a typical breakfast. Opens early too. Thanks for the delicious breakfast Food : 5/5 Amazing irish Breakfast! Lovely Very nice staff and breakfast was lovely,will be back Excellent breakfast. Excellent service Such a gem. Old school cafe feel but truly quality produce and meats, plus fantastic old school neighborhood friendly service. Really made our day! If your looking for a real breakfast in Dublin. This is the place you are looking for. A real greasy spoon but the food isnt greasy. The food is delicious. Very welcoming. Staff are so friendly. I enjoy eating my breakfast at the window watching the real smithfield working right outside. 10 stars Elite breakfast, extremely friendly staff The best poached eggs we had in Ireland. Very nice breakfast and excellent coffee. Parking: public parking across the road Without a doubt the best spot in Dublin. Amazing atmosphere, fantastic food, and Brendan is the best chap you ll meet in Ireland. You ll regret it if you don t visit here. Food A place where time forgot in the best possible way. You cannot get much closer to your own mother cooking you a breakfast. The chap behind the counter was very old school. They didnt take card so I went to get cash at the ATM. I came back and the breakfast was sitting waiting for me. Top class food, price and service. Definitely worth a visit. Great breakfast , lots buttered toast , good tea and coffee .Friendly staff ,warm welcome x Great authentic breakfast and lovely staff! Give yourself a treat and go there :D Great place for full irish breakfast opens 6am monday to  friday 7.30 saturday well liked by all the early vegetable market  workers and truck drivers delivering and collecting to the Dublin Fruit and Veg market and locals Brilliant breakfast. Quality fry and great value. Staff are very sound"
17,Brew Town Specialty Coffee Roastery/Cafe,4.975,"Stopped for a quick coffee in the evening Staff was friendly and courteous Coffee was amazing - I had the flat white with oat milk and they made it well They also had good fast food options - tried the vegan sausage, it was decent Have decent vegetarian and vegan options Really lovely staff and high quality coffee. Like most millenials do at some point in their lives, I was wandering around dublin searching for some single origin beans and a v60 pourover. Great spot to grab a coffee, a bag of beans and, if you spend over  30 you get a free coffee. Delightful stuff. Delicious coffee. You can tell they use high-quality beans. And they were open at eight on Sunday morning, which is a major plus plus great service as well. This place has the-best!! Coffee, I guarantee! They should sell their coffee to all cafes in the city. I m so happy I found this place Food : 3/5 I really like the coffee over there, it s a nice environment, they made my coffee very fast with a delicious flavor. It s what I was looking for. Thank you so much! Wow!!  First time customer, but definitely won t be the last time.  Amazing coffee and a great selection of food and cakes.  Fantastic service and every customer was looked after extremely well. Great coffee shop totally recommended, they have nice food and drinks specifically the sausages rolls. It s a local coffee place and they roast their own coffee. Excellent Americano and latte. Friendly folks! Very nice coffee to takeaway, perfect for enjoying in Stephens Green park. Staff could be a little friendlier, I wasnt aware my coffee was ready because they didnt tell me and was just sitting there. Exiting a bit awkward because they are sharing with a post office and limited space. Really nice coffee and great staff! So nice they open early on the weekend, much appreciated. very tasty coffee, the guys do the roasting themselves, I m delighted, I recommend visiting Brilliant little coffee shop, friendly staff always feel welcome every time you walk in. There are umpteen coffee shops to choose from in the city, especially on the south side, but Brew Town is, quite simply, the best. My order is a soy latte, sometimes with flavour shots, and Ive yet to have a bad one. Compostable cups and lids, lovely staff and efficient service. Quite simply un-fault-able. They roast their own beans! Which is a surprising and adventurous journey if you want to sample their roasts. *UPDATE* their beans are so aromatically potent! Probably need some time to sample all their roasts, but it s lovely to see they re doing well and I d love to support them for some roasts were really impressive.  Lack of variety for expresso and milk coffee drinks, but a decent cup indeed! The owner absolutely saved my day with a phone charger and a delicious chai latte! A lovely gentleman with excellent service BEST BROWINE EVER AND COFFEE WAS DELISH #Slayed Love this place! The house blend coffee is fantastic, but definitely worth trying the single blends as they do them (Im not a fan of the Brazilian blend, myself). The staff are brilliant and very and friendly. The food is first class, particularly the sausage rolls and the brownies! Lovely little cafe, service always first class and excellent coffee. Amazing coffee and amazing staff!! Highly recommended! Good quality of coffee , amazing service Great place, staff, coffee,  and absolutely incredible pastries.. I was in Dublin for a couple of mornings,  so happy I found this place.  Just a fantastic little coffee shop. Food Lovely  . I know the one of the owners of Brew Town. Andrius is amazing person who loves coffee. His staff is very professional. Here you should taste Cortado/Piccolo. Oh, yes, here you take quality cappuccino and Latte. You can check altitude of foam . Coti is amazing! I love the coffe One of the best coffee shops in Dublin! Friendly staff, delicious treats and sandwiches, well located (near to Stephens Green Park) and amazing coffee. If you havent been there, go and have a look. Great coffee and lovely staff! So good to have a coffee shop open early at the weekends to get your caffeine buzz. Brew town is a lovely place, with certificate Baristas that are also friendly and approachable!! The coffe is delicious and they have the best chocolate brownie ever!! Is super close to Stephens Green park, so you can enjoy your coffee there.. I would definitely recommend Good  quality lot choices. Good service  and price Excellent coffee. Great cafe. And they open early!! Amazing coffee and the staff are extremely friendly! If hungry you can t go wrong with the chipotle or pesto sandwich   Would highly recommend a visit Highly recommend perfect combination in between favourful coffee , delicious pastries and the best staff .well done Staff are lovely, coffee is great and always really quick service. Pastries are really nice as well, usually some gluten free options I couldnt recommend this tiny cafe more. It has one of the best coffee blends I have tried in the whole country. I will dearly miss it when I am moved to a different location. A great place with very friendly staff and the very good coffee. Their brownies and flat whites are to die for! Lovely coffee and teas to take away. St. Stephens Green is across the road so you can enjoy the beautiful park whilst drinking a delicious hot drink. This place has amazing coffee, the pastries and sandwiches are delicious and staff is friendly. Such a lovely place to visit Lovely coffee and lovely staff. And the croissants to die for! Excellent coffee , very friendly staff .Would highly recommend. good coffee, nice service Cant beat the happy hour  2 price for coffee in the morning between 8.30-9.30am. Great quality coffee. Everything is perfect, thank you"
18,Brewbaker Cafe,4.3375,"Staff was great and super kind. The food was out fast and amazing. It wasn t all that much either. Would absolutely go again if I ever go back to Dublin. Quick and friendly service on a Sunday morning. Good portion sizes of the egg & avocado toast and the cappuccino for 13 . Liked the chili on top of the poached eggs! Vegetarian options: Egg & avocado toast Cappuccino Service here is great and quite fast; I brought a big group (we hadn t booked a table beforehand) and the staff was really friendly. I just had coffee, but others in my party ate and mentioned the food was delicious. Prices are reasonable as well. Shout out to Livia, who was super friendly and made us feel welcome Not great. Food mediocre, service poor at best. Cold as doors have to be open. Cigarette smoke blows in from seating outside the door. Toilets out of order. Not what I expected and to be honest I feel ripped off. I expected more from a cafe in Dublin. Id avoid as there is far better available. Very kind service, good coffee but the only problem that wasnt enough option for breakfast because I dont like irish breakfast (no pork). It is simple place but we found it great for how they welcomed us with our 18 months old child... they served us very carefully, kindly and with flexibility and supporting every request we made (heat up the child food, have a high chair, being patient with him doing the first steps around). The food was good, tasty, abundant, nicely served and at the right price! Kid-friendliness: Very kind, flexible and helpful with children Service is great. Rhubarb pie and scones are amazing. Hot chocolate is not too sweet and really smooth. Best cafe in Dublin for a scone. I stopped in for their scone and tea special.  The raspberry and white chocolate scones were amazing!  Not too sweet, soft and moist on the inside, nice crisp outside,  freshly made, just perfect! Popped in with my daughter as she wanted a smoothie and I was hungry at lunchtime. She got the south pacific  5.75 which she rated 5/10 and I got the house special the brew baker  6.95 and a san pellegrino. The sambo was toasted as requested and lovely. Hard to find basic sambo places in town as everything is so expensive. Tempted to take a scone or two away as I hear great reviews about them. Handy spot near trinity. Would recommend. Livia was serving at the moment, she was so friendly and patient cos we have a group of more than 10 person come in to the cafe. We did having fun and nice coffee, breakfast here. Porridge has never tasted so good!  Creamy porridge with fresh fruit, nuts, honey, etc. was absolutely delicious. Fast, friendly service.  Highly recommended. I had a lovely time this morning at Brewbaker Cafe. I enjoyed the Mini Irish breakfast. For  8.00 this breakfast includes 2 slices of toast, 1 egg, one sausage, and one piece of bacon, as well as tea or coffee. While not the best value (Dunnes ILAC centre breakfast deal holds that title) the food was nourishing and the coffee was very good. I left feeling prepared to face the day ahead. If youre looking for a nice cafe to sit at in Dublin, I can recommend this one wholeheartedly. We had two great breakfasts at Brewbaker which is a small gem in the heart of Dublin. Decently priced with good food and service. I had breakfast with an old friend. Unlike a lot of places the breakfast was deliciously authentic and tasted just right. The waitress was a sweetheart. Bit chilly and basic decor but great coffee,massive portions, and friendly staff. Convenient location in Dublin near the college but a bit off the main drag. I would go back. Try the eggs, I bet you can t finish the plate! Dropped in yesterday for a mini breakfast, delicious. Conor and the team always look after me so well Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, and the food is fantastic (especially the scones)! Came here for breakfast. The food was lovely and the staff were very friendly. Id definitely be back Very lovely staff!! Amazing food. They have a very good avocado whit poached egg, the best porridge in the city!! Very very good My sandwich was good and big. The place is so cozy and people are friendly. We just had a few different scones and coffee.. Super fresh and very good. Service quick and accurate. Staff nice. Not expensive .Definitely a place you could make your regular breakfast spot. Food : 5/5 I m a regular customer here; the scones are really tasty and the staff is absolutely lovely! Everything was wonderful. The service was exceptional and outstanding. Especially Livia. Thank you so much. Great place for a quick breakfast in a quiet location with great staff. Got a Happy Friday from the staff member when I was leaving. I ordered the bacon and scrambled eggs which was a large portion. The value here is excellent too. Fantastic breakfast and lunch! We had a delicious sandwich, the best scone my husband had ever tasted, and perfect eggs. Friendly, attentive waitstaff. Very (deservedly) busy during lunch on the weekdays with Trinity College traffic. I love this place! Will come back when I m next in town! At last a no bull, real Irish Cafe with great choose your own filling sambos and a homemade rhubarb tart to die for! Tiocfaidh me ar ais! Columba Food We stopped in for a late lunch and got a Brewbaker sandwich and a scone. It was so good, we got a bunch of scones for lunch the next day. A great place to stop for a coffee and lunch. The ham, turkey, stuffing, cranberry, Christmas dinner inspired sandwich was amazing and paired wonderfully with a latte. The rhubarb pie was the best Ive had (dont tell my mum I said that).  Staff was a joy as well. Definitely recommend! Served by Beatriz- so helpful and kind. Very yummy food!! :) Stopped here in the afternoon for coffe and scone. The scone was really good, coffee too Its a small cozy place (ground and underground floor) with friendly staff. I really enjoyed the stop :) Lovely cafe, great food and very friendly staff. Went here with my partner yesterday for lunch. The food was absolutely divine, so fresh and tasty! The service was great everyone is so nice. The prices and nice and cheap to 10/10 we ll definitely be back! Food & Coffee is unreal especially the scones, Best scones in Ireland 100%! Excellent today. Excellent every time. My number 1 for breakfast in Dublin s south city. Had lunch with my work colleague yesterday. We also pop in for sone and coffee before work starts. Again with work colleagues. Which we have done on a regular bases for the last 5 years. Always recommended it to my clients if they want a Breakfast /Lunch or a good coffee. So it saddened me that we have had this experience and debate on this review. We feel we had no choice but do so. While having lunch yesterday which we bought tea sandwiches and chrisp totaling around 25 euros. One of the team is celiac and had his own sandwiches with him. A one off as he was not sure if they catered for celiacs!! We sat outside to enjoy after paying in full for above items. In the middle of lunch a guy who did not identified himself came to the table a abuse the celiac who was eating his lunch. He stood over him and told him he was not to eat his own sandwiches and towered over him. This guy is over 6 foot in his 60s. The colleague got very upset and ended up leaving and going back to work. This guy is a bully not good for business. He needs to be fired. A nastu pices of work !! Until such time as we receive a proper apology we will be boycotting Brewbaker and all its associated partners. We will not recommended it to our clients either. Jean please come back to Brewbaker.... Dietary restrictions: Not that it matters now. Celiac options Nice ciabatta! Generally good for lunch. Very nice spot! Popped in for a lunch meet-up with a friend and enjoyed a fantastic (and reasonably priced) sandwich with small side salad. Very nice food, excellent staff. Friendly, polite etc. Vegetarian options: I had the vegetarian focaccia on the menu. Very nice. The staff is lovely and the place is quite nice. The menu is not extensive, and a few options were not available, unfortunately. We got the Full Irish, which wasnt really a full one, as it doesnt come with Mushrooms, Beans nor Hashbrowns. Quality was good, not outstanding but 11  for 2 sausages, 2 rashers, half a tomato, 1 egg and a slice of pudding is a tad much. Good place for coffee and pastries in general. Server was super nice and helpful. Best bacon Ive had in ages and the coffee was nice and strong. Check this place out! Good coffee, ok breakfast sandwiches and some of the best scones we have had in our two weeks around Ireland Very cute little cafe, barista explained to us all her fresh baked treats. Very kind service. Scones were lovely! Cranberry white chocolate was delicious. Breakfast special of coffee and scone was very reasonably priced. Happy we stopped here and would come again in the area. nice place to have a short rest after visiting the national gallery. the homemade browny is great but still hope it could with less sugar hahaha Delicious scones and lots of interesting flavor choices. I had raspberry and white chocolate and a latte  both were great. Came here for a quick coffee but left with two slices of pie. Pies don t look fancy, but taste amazing. The Apple pie is nice and tart, not too sweet. The rhubarb pie is really smooth and not super tart - unlike any rhubarb pie I ve had back in America. Looking forward to coming back! Food and coffee was pretty good. But I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich, and was told they were out of bagels. So I got it on regular bread, but then my sandwich was sausage and bacon, with no egg. Nice people though. I d give it another chance. Quick and easy to order. Tasty toast. The food is fine, but the service is very poor. A chair collapsed under my friend as we ate. The response of the waitress was to tell us to  not worry about it  and something about  customers breaking chairs . The customer did not break the chair. Your old shoddy chair sheared and collapsed due to poor maintenance and being past it s end-of-life, potentially injuring my friend. Be more respectful of your customers. The staff also have a tendency to berate customers when ordering - and I don t dilly dally. Overall a very unfriendly experience. Opening hours are completely wrong. Grand sandwiches but opening hours are all over the place. Closed at 3pm on weekdays. Not open on weekends. Won t accept edits on their google listing - I don t know why. We popped in to warm up after getting soaked on a tour, 3 adults and five freezing children. We were promptly served gorgeous hot chocolates, coffees and really lovely cakes. The guy behind the counter even gave us a scone to try at home ( delish!).  Thanks a million x I wanted to highlight Marinas excellent service. The professionalism, good vibes, exchange with clients and service are excellent. Good education and manners with everyone; in addition to the fluency of the English language. Although she has a degree in interior design from a university in Buenos Aires, Argentina, while she waits for a job opportunity of her own, she decided to work temporarily in this place while she waits for an opportunity to be recognized for her talent in interior design anywhere. country of Europe. Stopped in by chance as I had time to kill before an appointment. I had a sausage sandwich which was lovely and a cappuccino which was delicious and hot. My friend had a blueberry scone and he said it fell apart it was so fresh. The staff were very friendly and I will certainly go back. Fair prices for these days so I would highly recommend. The spanish barista was lovely and very kind to us. My wife and I shared a tasty Brewbaker Ciabatta and our daughter had one of the best scones around. Highly recommend. They were having some issues with the electricity and the girl at the counter managed it amazingly. She was super kind and so the rest of the staff. I would definitely come back, really nice environment. Filter coffee is pretty good too. Sandwiches are nice but quite pricey. There is also a serious understaffing issue. They also run out of ingredients very quickly and dont replace them. flat white wasn t great, coffee too acidic. also charging extra for plant milk is out of style. and why have 6+ smoothies on the menu when you can only make 2 ? muffin was tasty though. Got a coffee and sandwiches with a mate and both were underwhelmed by the quality of food. It seemed like in the process of purchasing the coffee machines, the business ran out of budget for the beans and other ingredients. Honestly you d find better quality food for cheaper in the Marks and Spencer s around the corner Great place for proper italian coffee lavazza with a fresh made scone in the morning, easiest me into the working day Dissapointed. Quite possibly the worst breakfast. The big breakfast had two low quality sausages and dry bacon. No beans, mushrooms etc. Very dry and no sauces available. I wouldnt call it very big. Profit margin over quality definitely obvious here and about the same price as other establishments with far better quality offerings. Came here for a coffee and scone. Absolutely very tasty and will definitely be back I love the charm of this place. Regularly frequented by politicians and reporters, it is for me, perhaps the cosiest cafe in the city. You will be certain to enjoy your meal in the peaceful environment. The Brewbaker is located in a very posh part of the city but for all that it is relatively inexpensive. Always a thrill to visit. Very ambitious claim to have the best scones in Dublin. On the evidence if the raisin scone they are not far off   I will be back for the blueberry. Lovely staff ! Short space but perfect for lunch between Trinity and the museums. Good food and one of the best coffee in Dublin. Vivement recommende ! Perfect for a real Irish Breakfast, we enjoyed ourselves, I recommend ++++ Very unfriendly service because they were nearly closing, which we didn t know because of the missing opening hours. The (sour) tea was served in a take-away cup with the bag just thrown in. Maybe a bad day? Decent coffee and breakfast. Not super expensive considering the area. I had a full Irish breakfast and a large cup of coffee for under 10 euro. Really Nice scones. Would go again. A bit small only 3 or 4 tables inside. Still a nice place I stop here in the mornings for a cup of coffee before work. Its relaxed environment, complimented by its wonderful morning hostess make it an ideal start for the working day. The best apple pie in Dublin. Good coffee, small premises, seating outside if its dry. Went there to have an  beverage and A Scone and a  latte must say it was Very tasty scone very tasty and latte Tasty I regularly go in for a smoothie and a sandwich on my break and both are delicious. Very good service and very friendly staff. Great food, and very reasonably priced. Relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. Love it here. Small, cramped, understaffed. Barely qualifies as a coffee stand. They offer non-dairy alternatives though (soya milk). The coffee was nice but the cake was a little dry and stale. Shame as it looked delicious! Alway a great sandwich and home made scones food to enjoy , the great staff to look after you Cozy place. Nice coffee and very tasty scones as they say. Best place for scones Outside seating quick service. Great coffee Efficient! Also very nice staff and a good selection of food. Staff are always very helpful and pleasant here and the service is fantastic too The panini I had was neither good, nor fast, nor well-priced wont go there again for food"
19,Brick Alley Cafe,4.05,"Probably I will never understand this kind of food, but it was tasty. Places nearby open at 12, so at 10am it was the best option. The staff is friendly, it is especially nice that Ukrainians work here, the service feels much nicer, thank you guys. Came here a few times for breakfast while on vacation. The food, coffee, and hot chocolate were all amazing. Definitely my favorite breakfast place in Dublin! We just had drinks!  This place is legendary and worth a visit. Crowded, super fun, great music. The whole area is artsy and just the place to be in Dublin Lovely little cafe. Friendly staff. Good quality food at reasonable prices.  Lovely beer. A good bar/cafe in the middle of the town in Temple Bar area. Good location, not far away from the river Liffey. I can t say that the prices is low, I payed 9  for Irish coffee. It was delicious and I enjoyed it. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. There is a WC. I had the small Irish breakfast and cappuccino. Both were quite good but not mind-blowing. Great atmosphere, nice staff, and good location! This place was perfect for lunch. The waitress was very friendly. There was music and many people sat on tables. The food was fresh and delicious. The prices are reasonable Bon Appetit!!! Food Loved the atmosphere, and the service was brilliant. Its a quiet place for a quick coffee and snack during the morning Would love to come back again. Its not too expensive either - Average prices. They are supposed to open at 9. We went and peeked in at 905. A guy said we could come in. We sat at a 4 person table. For 20 minutes we waited as the worker was getting situated. Another lady was also running around getting the bar/restaurant ready. At no time in those 15/20 minutes did either person offer us coffee or water as they got ready. At 920 two guys and a lady came in and got service before us, even though we were there 15 minutes before them. Service was great, food was reasonably priced for Dublin. My friend said the Vegetarian breakfast was amazing. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because the cheesecake base was rock solid. Great food and really nice place right next to the Temple bar. The owner is there almost daily which gives it nice family feeling. Recommended place for brunch, coffee or pint. We love this super friendly cafe, young and attentive team, and very good breakfast at a reasonable price! Just had coffee and the opera cake  8.95. It was as hard as a brick and inedible , told staff, but still had to pay full price for something I couldnt eat. Bill was  2 black coffees, muffin, and Opera cake  21.80 !  We will not be back. So disappointing. After confirming that they were still serving breakfast (at 11.45), they took 15 minutes to come take out order, only to tell us that they wouldn t be serving breakfast. Please note that they had just taken the order of a table who arrived AFTER us and ordered breakfast. It was then noon, so we couldn t go anywhere else for breakfast after that. Thanks for ruining our day in Dublin. We popped in during Trad Fest because it was absolute madness on the streets quiet inside so we had Prosecco and a sweet. Attentive service and a low-key atmosphere. I wouldn t say it s  touristy    (isn t most everything in this area) it s authentic.  Nice people. Door kept being left open letting in cold air. Soup was warm and tasty. Han and cheese was standard. Tea was nice and hot for the weather. Staff was excellent if a bit busy. Really nice chilled out vibe, great staff really friendly and made us feel at home. Food is fantastic. Good taste in music. Would have been better, but the prives on the Board are not Update. So it feels like a tourist scam. Easy to fix with a pen. Steer clear the food tastes like the cheapest of ingredients and not value for money Had a few drinks and irish coffee over lovely conversation and electrifying atmosphere charged with great music Cozy atmosphere, great welcome. Excellent coffee with milk. I didnt taste the meals so I wont rate them. Great discovery in the center of Dublin. Very pleasant welcome and service. Dishes chosen for an impromptu lunch at 2:45 p.m., simply perfect. THANKS !! Good place just to stop and rest from your day. Not very busy during afternoon. Little slow service. Expensive and mediocre. Charged  8.95 for a chocolate brownie. Coffee and hot chocolate were not as hot as they should have been. Toilets were filthy They had great chocolate cake and friendly staff once so went back, for the last time. One large americano, one reg hot chocolate , one tea and 2 millionaire slice cost   28. The cake was awful, really hard and cold and tasteless, coffee was mid at best: Hot choco nice . Pity it s a nice venue, but a disappointing effortless joyless experience now . Best Cafe in Temple Bar! I would highly recommend stopping here for an Irish Coffee. My sister and I went back several times during our stay in Dublin. Great atmosphere and nice staff. We also ended up running into the owner at a pub one evening and chatted with him for a while - he was incredibly kind and takes a lot of pride in this cafe! Definitely check it out! Nice place to have a good tea time. Delicious pastries, especially the blueberry cheesecake and the wide range of herbal teas #yummy ! Good service by a nice team Lovely breakfast, chai latte is delicious! Very friendly & quick service. Fantastic day deal! Kitchen was a little slow but otherwise loved everything :) Dismiss the old reviews!!!! This place has changed for the better. It has a very nice atmosphere. Sometimes has live music. The staff are very friendly. It s a lovely place to have a drink if you don t feel like being in an obnoxious pub. food was lovely, staff were really friendly and it s a lovely wee spot Superb location! The hot chocolates are absolutely perfect! A respected and honored art which therefore results in a slightly high price and a slight wait before receiving our orders! But frankly its well worth it, the taste is exquisite, the place nice and well placed!! A repeat without hesitation Hoob could have done with more stank, but apart from that a great experience. Took 20 minutes to order and receive a take out Irish coffee - very expensive at  9.50. Staff were rude and not apologetic at all for the long wait. At least the coffee tasted good after all that time Love this place! I usually have a Baileys hot chocolate here. It s such a cosy vibe, right in the middle of the city and open late. Couldn t recommend it enough Great place to have a coffee, beer, or cake. Live music and kind people. Great atmosphere, everyone welcome + amazing food & coffee. We had a lovely time and I am super glad that we randomly ended up there! I would highly recommend for a quick coffee/snack break when visiting Dublin Went here first morning of a short break on Dublin. Found this place not far from our hotel. Had the full Irish breakfast and a latte, others in the party had the pancakes. Enjoyed it so much we went back the next day. Food : 5/5 Stopped in for a quick pastry on our way to Guinness Storehouse tour. Fab service, tasty food at a reasonable price. Rude barista, rude staff, and coffee that tastes like piss. All at a high price."
20,Brother Hubbard (North),3.825,"Probably my least favorite place in Dublin! Food: The food was not good due to the odd mix of ingredients. We were a group of 5 and the only people that liked their food were the ones that ordered the full Irish breakfast which you can t get wrong. (Cherry on top was the Hair in the plate). Server: The server we had was very dismissive and would walk away mid order. We asked for multiple things that never came including the basics(water). Atmosphere: Not too bad! Big space and interesting decor. I personally wouldn t recommend this restaurant. The offer is different from your usual brunch, Middle Eastern influences are strong and I couldnt be happier about it. Everything we tasted was delicious! The atmosphere was lovely too and the service very quick considering how full the place was and how elaborate the dishes were. I personally ordered the Frenchie and an iced chai and I wasnt disappointed. I tasted the cinnamon roll, the Pulled Pork Benedict and the Seasonal Vegan Plate. Heavenly. Ill be back to try other dishes! How should  I start? The place it self is nice, very charming and cozy. However the staff are really rude, the service takes too long to go to you. I place an order and it took it more than 30 min to get my food. They started with the drink and once, we got the food all the drink were gone. I went there in a Friday, had a ginger beer and a granola , the dish of the granola was dirty and had stains from the previous costumer. The dish itself was okay, the portion was really small and the price was really expensive. About the staff they were really rude. I wouldn t recommend this place to anyone, you cannot change or remove some options from the dish like if u are allergic is better not to order. A Gem of a Cafe with Exceptional Service and Food! I recently had the pleasure of visiting Brother Hubbard (North) cafe, and I must say, it was an absolute delight! From the moment we walked in, the service was top-notch - friendly, attentive, and welcoming. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful, making great recommendations and ensuring our every need was met. But the real star of the show was the food! Oh, the food! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork, and it was simply divine. The eggs were poached to perfection, the hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy, and the pulled pork added a delicious smoky flavor. It was a match made in heaven! The atmosphere was cozy and modern, with a lovely vibe that made us feel right at home. The prices were very reasonable, especially considering the high quality of the food and service. Overall, I would highly recommend Brother Hubbard (North) cafe to anyone looking for a fantastic breakfast or brunch spot. We cant wait to go back and try more of their delicious dishes! Rating: 5/5 stars Price: Moderate (PS15-PS25 per person) Recommended for: Anyone seeking exceptional service, delicious food, and a cozy atmosphere. A must-visit for breakfast or brunch. Brother Hubbard, located in Dublin, is a vibrant and inviting cafe known for its Middle Eastern-inspired menu and warm, bustling atmosphere. The moment you step in, youre greeted with the delightful aroma of freshly brewed coffee and exotic spices. The decor is modern yet cozy, making it a perfect spot for a casual brunch or a quick coffee break. Their menu is a culinary adventure, featuring dishes like Moroccan eggs, shakshuka, and a variety of hearty sandwiches and salads, all prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients. The flavors are bold and well-balanced, offering a refreshing twist on traditional cafe fare. The staff at Brother Hubbard are friendly and attentive, adding to the overall positive dining experience. Whether youre a local or a tourist, this cafe is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy delicious food in a relaxed and charming setting. However, be prepared for a bit of a wait during peak hours, as it s a popular spot among Dubliners. Overall, Brother Hubbard is a gem in Dublins vibrant food scene. Amazing place, really nice food! Amazing to have a brunch with friends. The place is really busy to the service is a little bit slow but every minute of wait is worth. For sure I ll be back more times . I try the French Toast and the chinammon Roll, divine! The voce is perfect as well The atmosphere of this spot was the best part of my brunch visit. Bustling and full of well-dressed people with a hipster chic vibe, it was a great and warm atmosphere to have brunch in. The service was disjointed and sporadic with our group having the flag down servers a few times when in need of things. And the food was sadly quite disappointing. The menu read like an interesting, eclectic and high end brunch spot but in execution our dishes were bland. My seasonal salad plate but dull, the fruit scone mediocre and the pulled pork sandwich was also mediocre. I would recommend the hot sauce however as we ordered it as a side and it was delicious. We came at peak brunch hour and had a reservation and would recommend making on as the place was packed. Wife and I came here just after we arrived in Dublin on Dec 22nd and had a fantastic brunch. The space is lovely and much bigger than it seems from the outside, and as we walked in we passed the pastry / dessert table which looked amazing. We were quickly sat at a table. My only critique is for the slow and inattentive service. Our server was very young and she seemed out of her element, and only showed up to take our order and drop our check. But the food was satisfying (though not outstanding) and we very much enjoyed the ambiance. A very known place around city centre. It s my second time here and I shall never return. I ordered The Basic PLUS- Eggs, Toast with Haloumi and was just like that . A very dried tomato Two slices of an old bread, like a bread from yesterday toasted 3 Spanish leaves and those fried cheese . Watery Poached eggs. For the price it doesn t worth it. I went out to enjoy a very nice brunch and returned to home completely disappointed. Tasteful food, I got the pulled pork toast and It was delightful. The service of my male waiter was exceptional, happy pride! But at the end the short hair girl got an attitude when I asked for separate bill for item which she denied. Long story short ruined the good vibes and amazing food. Great atmosphere. Food presentation was beautiful but the flavors didnt excatly add up for me. The staff were very kind and welcoming.  Reasonable pricing and a well designed menu. Dublin, Ireland Delicious and fresh middle eastern food. I recommend the hummus, roasted cauliflower and the cod. Vegetarian options: Vegetarian and pescatarian options. We tried many brunch options. Everything is delicious. Right portion size as well. Perfect for a nice weekend brunch! We had brunch here without a reservation, only had to wait (inside) for less than 10 . The place has a nice vibe. My plate of choice seemed more interesting in the menu than in reality. The hot chocolate was really nice though. Not sure If I would visit second time. Vegetarian options: There are some vegetarian options. This establishment is very well equipped and has a great vibe. It was busy but not full on a Tuesday late morning. We went for a breakfast and found a super vegan oat milk chai latte. Their regular coffee is also excellent and they chose a great house blend. The food was a little disappointing. They have good flavours but the execution could be better. The chicken sandwich had great bread and was really nicely marinated, but the chicken was very cold out the fridge. It was a temperature that didn t fit with the other components and detracted from the taste. It came with a choice of soup or salad, I option for a soup which was perfectly tasty and a nice touch. There were not many vegan options but they did make their regular poached egg dish with more veggies instead of the eggs. It was a nice thought but it didn t really work. As a large place that was a first stop on the Netflix show  somebody feed Phil  I would have expected the exotic flavours to be executed with a little more finesse. I would recommend it to someone as a place for a nice breakfast that s worth the money, but I think anyone visiting because of the show might be slightly underwhelmed. Saturday brunch.   Had higher expectations but mediocre service put a bit of a damper on things. Food was ok. Pastries are a highlight though and highly recommended. Great menu here. Visited twice. Food is wonderful. Good sized portions. Tasty. Service - needs attention. Wait to be served. Try to make eye contact but get ignored.  Ordered tea but milk was off. Was brought new cup and milk but tea not replaced. A shame as this is otherwise a great place but something missing to make it 5 stars. Breakfast was so delicious, probably the best place for breakfast in Dublin. Portions were big Food We were cheerfully greeted and seated by friendly staff. Our table was deceptively large, plenty space for the six of us to relax and order copious amounts of food and drink. The food was divine. The dining space was bright and airy, the atmosphere was totally chill. We had a thoroughly gorgeous brunch. All six of us agreed, we will definitely be recommending and returning to Brother Hubbards. ...... I say again, the food was divine Not worth the hype! We waited 40 mins for a coffee (after several reminders) to get a half filled glass. When the food finally arrived the egg Benedict was over cooked (pictured). Awesome environment, Refreshment at the morning time. Making a mind fresh with the nice coffee and breakfast. The most loving part is the atmospher and environment. Highly Recommended and will be back soon. Heard great things about this place, went for brunch Sunday early afternoon. The guy at front door really friendly and seated us quickly within 3 mins of arrival. Wait staff seemed very scattered and looks like too many tables not enough staff. Waited 20 mins to take order. Got two coffees which came down cold, we had to get hot water to top up as opposed to asking staff to get fresh, to be fair they were under pressure. Got the poached eggs and mushroom dish and two portions of the chocolate brioche bread. The eggs were cold and sat on soggy bread .. the French toast brioche was so bland, hidden by lashings of sweet pink marscapone cream. I m so sorry to give this food and place a bad review, but for all the above ans two coffees we paid  55 euro and we left most of it behind us. Very bland, mushy cold food, perfect for instagram photos maybe but unfortunately that s about it. Much better places to eat in Dublin. So delighted to happen across this restaurant today for lunch. Perfect sharing portions, interesting flavours of the Middle East. The Lamb Shawarma was perfect; the pickles balancing out any richness. Too often in Ireland it s the same old menu everywhere. Brother Hubbard knows spice & flavour. Well done all. Excellent food, fast efficient service, great value. I came here for a brunch with one of my friends, I really liked the atmosphere, the place is really spacious and the service is really good as well. Will definitely come back again! Great atmosphere and everything looks nice, but thats where the nice things end. The food is very bland (in case of savoury dishes) or overpoweringly sweet (french toast). All items sound amazing on the menu and look lovely in photos, but the taste doesnt match it. We also had to wait a very long time for our meals. Staff was nice, but clearly not enough people. I highly recommend you do a booking if you do decide to come here to make sure you get a table as the place is very popular. I can t recommend more this place the taste of the food is really good, even the chocolate cake tastes different as usual one I must say much better, the hummus were so delicious and I ve triyed many more before.  The place is big and clean, there is not tap water for free. When you ask for your bill they give you a mint tea no charge. Good value for money. No needed reservation in advance.  Service of the coffe a little slow. Disable toilet available here which one is very thoughtfully. I loved the place and the food but service do not meet the standards. We came for brunch, ordered straight away two dishes and two scones for dessert to be served after. Weve asked if thats possible and the guy told us that its not a problem and we can just give him a sign once were ready. But once we got our meals staff seemed to forgot about us, we waited forever to draw somebodys attention and finally when other waiter came to clean our plates we were told that the scones are gone. I was expecting them to be reserved as we ordered theme long before. Well, a huge shame as we came there for famous scones. After that we said we would like to pay, but waiter will not come to our table for about 10 minutes, so my husband went to pay at the till, but the waitress was quite irritated that we dont know the tables number, what was ridiculous as they are not displayed on the tables themselves. To sum up- I loved the interior design, the two meals that I tried were delicious, as well as was the coffee. Such a shame that the poor service ruined the experience for us. You can not miss this place! Especially if you re looking for something cozy with finger licking food. Their breakfast is creative and not boring, but absolutely delicious with a stylish Middle East touch. I had lamb shawarma and my friends had brunchy eggs sandwiches, both were great. Coffee and tea were good. Only their burnt cheesecake can be improved - it should be more soft and creamy in my opinion. Try to come earlier, because place gets very busy and on weekends you might encounter a queue. Always satisfied with the quality of food and service at Brother Hubbard. A great place for brunch! The venue is spacious inside with a lovely naturally-lit hall. The pulled pork benedict was amazing! We also chose a side of sweet potato wedges to share which was equally as good. We'd recommend this spot to everyone! Service was really slow which was a shame. Visited on a Saturday for brunch so understand they were busy, but had to ask for tap water twice to different waiters plus three times for cutlery! All the staff looked a bit put out when we asked a question of required something simple (like cutlery or water!) Food was okay, nothing to shout about. I ve had better dishes in similar venues. Just expected more from a venue where dishes are around  15 and charging around  12 for a cocktail. Great coffee. The place was nice and the food was ok. The table next to us was very loud. Due to our reservation, we could cut in line and only had to wait ~10 mins. Im disappointed to say that my experience at this restaurant was quite a letdown. We chose this charming spot for brunch with friends, enticed by its promising menu featuring a variety of dishes, including vegetarian options. The menu indicated a special promotion: a discounted price for a main course and a drink. However, it failed to mention the restriction on serving alcoholic beverages before 12:30 PM on Sundays. When we placed our order, we unwittingly included alcoholic drinks. After a while, another waitress informed us that we had to change our order because alcoholic beverages couldnt be served. We complied, but when the bill arrived, the alcoholic drinks were still on it. This was puzzling and frustrating. If the restaurant knows it cant serve alcohol, it should not have been on the menu or the order in the first place. Moreover, my choice of babaganoush was disappointing. Instead of the classic babaganoush, I received a simple dish of roasted eggplant. Despite these issues, the food was decent. However, the overall experience was marred by the confusion and lack of attention to detail. I hope the restaurant addresses these concerns, as clear communication and accuracy are vital for a positive dining experience. Heres to hoping for a more seamless experience in the future. We had a lovely Mediterranean inspired brunch/lunch. We had delicious coffee and scone followed by roasted vegetables and hummus on sourdough, a lamb shawarma plate, and french toast for the kids. The setting is lovely, staff is friendly, and the food was great! Stumbled across Brother Hubbard and I m glad we did. Restaurants in Dublin are usually pretty small but this restaurant was large for Dublin standards. Didn t feel cramped, which was nice. I got the BH Bacon & Egg Sandwich and it was really good. Also, they have unique drinks that are pretty good. Definitely a great brunch spot. Food was good, but options where limited, I guess a bigger variety would be great. The local is loud, and the service could be better, we had to fight for getting their attention every time.. Food A nice restaurant with good staff and nice ambiance. The food quality is ok, and the pricing is decent. However, overall we felt there was comparatively less choice in terms of food. Also some of the items we saw were a bit off putting - say bottled orange juice for a mimosa instead of fresh and so on. Overall a decent place to dine with friends for a brunch. In the looking for a nice place to brunch, found this amazing place. The ambience it s kind of mid-century feat. Scandinavian in a perfect way I can actually stay there for hours in the inviting atmosphere. In addition to this food was remarkable, effortless but whit that perfect touch that can take a chicken sandwich to the next level (tzatziki in this case) with perfect bread. For dessert the ladies on the next table recommended this Black Forest cup cake that was just the perfect amount of sweetness and chocolate. For me A MUST visit place. We ate cheesecake and Noah desserts, they were delicious, I recommend them. We drank Earl Gray tea and I liked it very much. Prices are a bit expensive, the environment is calm and peaceful. Staff could have been a little more helpful Because my order was wrong :( but its not a problem, I was satisfied with the overall situation, thank you for everything A nice place for taking pictures rather than eating. The meat ball has a very strongly goat/lamb meat smell  Not sure what it is. Not all of people can stand it. Pork is better. The staff take us 10 euros for large table service fee(more than 5 people) without telling us in advance. It is the reason I gave one start. I don t know whether it is common for all the restaurants in Dublin. You know, I prefer eating separately for saving the money It is a very busy place. Many people come as it is famous. I know they already treat this for granted. Also looking by what they replied me as followed, I confirm it. They seems tell me: If you do not like the food, it is your own problem. Our food is fresh. If you did not to read every line in the menu carefully , it your own problem. Not ours."
21,Busyfeet & Coco Cafe,4.025,"This cafeteria in the middle of city center feels welcoming when you walk in. The staff is friendly but not pushy, letting customers eat without feeling rushed. The food tastes fresh and has a local touch, giving it a great flavor. The magic touch is with a lovely mexican barista that not only delivers beautiful art latte coffees but has special touch in flavor, I highly recommend Matcha Latte ;) Overall, this cafeteria is a great find with good food, reasonable prices, and a nice atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit if you want a tasty meal in a relaxed setting. Vegetarian options: Options for vegans on their menu Food was delicious and the staff were so friendly and welcoming! Highly recommend. The service was good. The food was ok. We asked for Eggs avocado, Eggs smoked salmon and 2 Mango Tango smoothies. They have the same prices as restaurants with a bit better quality. Not recommended if you are in the mood to eat something good. If you just go for the coffee, it would be ok. My coffee was amazing, my food was lovely, the staff were great. I felt they were under pressure to be very attentive to us. After a while it got irritating constantly being checked on. Every single dish was cleaned the second we finished, and we were asked constantly how our food was. I noticed the table beside me got a bit rude with the staff over it, but they also were constantly checked on. The staff were really really nice though and think they are probably under pressure from management to keep checking on tables. It was still a lovely place with good prices and great food, I ll definitely be back, just this one issue. Fantastic Trad Breakfast, really quick service and lots of lovely options. Also had a coffee and hot chocolate which were tasty. Vegetarian options: They have lots of variety in the menu so vegetarian options are easy Lovely find right off Grafton street. Plenty of seating for a smaller cafe/restaurant. The playlist was great, the server was very attentive and it was perfect for a nice early dinner. They have a kinda chill bar/retro 60s vibe, very causal. The bathrooms were clean and not divided by gender. We started with drinks, house white was nice and a decent portion of tea. We got the Coco burger, Asian chicken salad and the quesadillas/wraps with a side of fries. All absolutely amazing, super quick service and big portions. The salad wasnt too meat heavy with only a few strips of chicken but the dressing was amazing. We then got apple crumble, gluten free brownies and carrot cake. All were lovely and came with a portion of whipped cream to the side. Portions were a touch small but still really well made desserts! Paid around 60 for a table of 3 which is good for a Grafton street, definitely will be coming back! Dietary restrictions: The brownie was gluten free and really delicious! I was a regular customer here, until one day I was met with very rude staff. The waitress asked me to leave in 30ish minutes, soon after I was done with my food and drink, whereas the people who were sitting around for much longer than me were treated with a lot more politeness and respect and faced no pressure to leave even when they werent necessarily ordering. I was alone at my table and the only person of colour at the cafe at that time, and I cant believe people even these days have such biases and differential treatment. I had literally just finished, also considering I was only there for a very short period of time makes it all the more evident that the waitress had her biases towards other races. Even worse, the manager also didnt own up to the bad experience. Really awful and I never wish to go back here again. Nice established spot in the city centre, friendly staff and good food Absolutely fantastic Breakfast we had at MIMI. Very kindly attended, great staff working there. Food This place has seriously gone downhill. Used to do lovely food but we went in today and the food was of very poor quality especially considering the price. Tiny overcooked eggs, cheap sausages and reheated potato cubes The place is situated at nice spot but the food is normal and the options are not very flexible for diary intolerant or people with allergies. Dietary restrictions: Not very suit The place and ambient is quite nice however bit cold inside. The price is very high related to the quality of food. I ordered toast and egg (8 ) with sausages (4  for 2!) And eggs royale (with salmon) the hollandaise sauce clearly was made with margarine, very bad! The quality of the products for sure can be said that is similar or inferior to lidl products. Service was okay. Unfortunately I dont want to be back Burgers are nice, fries at  5-6 extra are horrible, Macdonalds does better for much less. Told staff fries were terrible, could not eat, they didnt offer any alternative yet we had to pay for them... I was super excited to have an avocado toast, and I got really disappointed with my order. The bread wasnt property toast, the avocado was tasteless.  The crispy potatoes werent crispy at all. I ordered fresh orange juice and I was served juice from the box.  The staff is friendly. I had not been here in years and used to go a lot when in town and happy to say still good. Decor completely changed. It was previously more a cosy cafe now more like trendy late bar meets shabby chic. Food and service still good. Great to see same guy still working there. I enjoyed my melt sandwich with Brie and Serrano ham. Staffs are very friendly and smiley. Stress free place for food and drink. Lovely staff and delicious food. I tried brunch it was perfect. I am looking forward to back for lunch also!! Came here for a quick lunch as wasn t super hungry. Food was ok but considering the price for a sandwich it didn t wow me at all. But for a quick bite to eat and a refuel stop it was ok! The place was very nice, service was great. Kind and helpful staff. The food was good value for money. Lovely place to have a quick snack, and staff is the best, so kind and friendly! Amazing cafe with the most helpful and kind staff, good food, especially breakfast. Had an outdoor meal here, had our dog with us too. Staff were very accomodating & service was super! Food is also delicious & great value. Delicious food, good price, friendly staff A terrace and a little sun! We were treated to some sunny spells today and we are very happy. This little cafe is ideal for stopping for a while and having a light dinner before continuing to explore Dublin. The service was perfect and the food was as desired. Staff were really friendly, busy Sunday morning. Eggs benedict was great, eggs perfect hollandaise delicious. Full breakfast good value, ingredients decent quality, although oh unsure about the sausage, could be total personal preference. Coffee good also, was busy but service timings good Tastier gluten free brownie I ve ever had! They have gluten free beer too! Cute lil place! Friendly staff and the coffee was great Food : 5/5 Cafe which served ice coffee is      . Great coffee, sourdough sandwich toasted w cheese is super delicious too!  Will definitely return!!! Nice place for lunch, brunch and breakfast! Clean, reasonably priced cafe, adults had coffee and kids had milkshakes, all were nice. Would recommend this cafe Nice spot for brunch and super friendly staff. We did have to wait a while to get our food (~30min) and it came quite cold but apart from that tasty food :) Great little place with excellent food and service. Prices are also very good. Excellent value for money. The food is also very good We came to this place every week for a year. Today We sit outside 4-5 friends drink like 6-7 cofees, one of us eat food. In 2 hours they bring the bill. This is so rude if you are a regular and if you eat/drink something rather than water. They said they need the table( the rest of the tables are not full) and its business sorry. You lost us guys :( Had the Coco Burger and a Beer in the sunshine outside watching the bustle of Sth William Street go by. A great Friday early evening unwind. Atmosphere and staff make it very welcoming, and I ve been grabbing my morning coffee from here now too. Happy to recommend. Such a delicious lunch, simple food, the hummus with marinated paprika and tomato salsa on a side were mind blowing The staff is kind and delicious egg Benedict&cappuccino the only negative thing I could think of is that we waited a bit longer than other guests. the classic burger was great and so was everything else. Id love to visit again Delicious Food, nice staff and fair priced food! Beautiful place. Went for midweek breakfast. Staff are lovely and friendly but possibly the worst  breakfasts we ve ever been served. (Scrambled egg like airplane food, Avon on toast with greasy, undercooked bacon) Won t be back Fab spot. Cosy coffee & cake are winners all year round! The chickpea and chorizo stew is a perfect antidote for cold and wet winter weather."
22,Butlers Chocolate Cafe,4.0625,"Grabbed a coffee on Saturday and Sunday. Both were a little too hot if Im being picky, but I dont mind as its tasty. None of the staff are particularly friendly. Seems they dont want to be there. Quality of the barrista was poor. If Im paying 4.70 for a coffee, a nice fluffy top with a heart is kinda expected. The best part is the chocolate. Its a shame as the staff and coffee are usually 10/10. A little enthusiasm and improved barrista skills wouldnt go amiss. My wife bought  60 worth of chocolates. Asked if she could taste one of those that go with coffees. Bruna answered her rudely  if you buy one you get one . Some nerve staff has in that particular shop. Unheard of. Food : 5/5 Visited on a weekday afternoon and ordered a White Mocha - it was delicious and very reasonably priced. They also offer a complimentary chocolate with your drink. Returned this afternoon and purchased several chocolate boxes to take home as gifts (around  50) - found it strange they dont offer a complimentary chocolate with such a large purchase. Best hot chocolate in town, hands down! They offer a free piece of chocolate with any beverage purchased here. I can also recommend the white mocha. All drinks are creamy and filling. There are also chocolate packs and bars available to buy as gifts. Great coffee, I recomend the espresso and the mocha. Friendly staff. You also get a complementary chocolate with a coffee. After the privous experience, I went here for a vanilla latte. Staff nice offered a complimentary chocolate and the vanilla late was ok wasnt as fabulous as I was expected from previous reviews. Service was quick and lovely staff, chocolate is very good. Honestly, I wouldnt come for another late here, maybe a different type of coffee or hot chocolate. Ciao! No sign that says there should be only 4 people allowed inside... Just a barely understandable staff member that mumbles and hand gestures you to stay out, like you have plague. Not to mention they put 2 chocolate pieces together in same paper bag like I live in the same household with person Im having coffee with... Plus, there arent any hand towels on site to be seen. So those are some serious double standards at work here. I know the sign isnt really staffs fault, but management, but they could point it out to them same for other things mentioned here. They give free chocolate with coffee. I really like the taste of hot chocolate here, and strawberry milkshake is too good. They dont allow sitting inside, thats the only thing i dont like about Butlers. The absolute highlight of my morning routine in Dublin.  I had no idea that I would get a free chocolate with my coffee....what an incredible and delicious way to start the day. Best coffee shop in Dublin. Way better than  sucks any day AND you get a free chocolate   with your drink. Sometimes the specialty seasonal drinks arent great but each year theyre improving from previous seasons. Love the loyalty program as well, free drink every 10th and you can stack them up so 2 or more can be used at the same time. Been a happy customer for 25 years and raised a fan family. Used to be very good, customer service has gone terrible with the turnover in staff. Last two times trying to get coffee. 4 employees working only one actually serving customers and making coffee. These two cleaning the same thing and counter as slow as possible. No one else in the shop and Im not being served for around 2 minutes. People in front of me the first time cursed and left because no one was serving them Friendly service and absolutely delicious hot chocolate. Almost worth the layover just for Butlers hot chocolate and mocha. I tried pumpkin spice latte and it was so so delicious   I highly recommended Excellent hot chocolate and they give in addition, one chocolate to taste. Not very expensive and very good quality. Good coffee, reasonable price, friendly staff. Free chocolate is a plus! If I could give 100 stars wouldn t be enough for the service I get here everyday, love all your team in Henry street they just make my day better every time I visit I come here any time Im near the area and it truly has the nicest, strongest coffee by a mile. The staff are lovely and attentive. On my last visit on 13/01/23 I accidentally spilled some coffee and was so embarrassed but the two girls working there were so kind and cleaned it up without making a fuss and were generally just very pleasant. I swear the atmosphere made the coffee taste even nicer Amazing staff so nice and friendly always smiling and also for recommendations of gifts. Coffee also extra hot and now the staff know my order I feel like they know me personally lol. coffee quality is bad, baristas brew same coffee for everyone, you can order latte cappuccino or flat white, at the end you will get same  americano with milk. baristas are not good. Best chocolate in the world.. i love going there having a cup of coffee with a piece of chocolate.. only con is that this branch is too small. Butlers chocolates are indeed the best. About hot chocolate, they are good. I remember when I came to Ireland everyone telling me they have the best hot chocolate. For me its good, but not the best. Probably all the hype made my expectations reach a peak. But I suggest everyone should give it a shot. I still have a hot chocolate from Butlers every now and then. One of the smallest branches in butler. Friendly staff. Efficient and quick. My only concern is the food safety that the pot of hot melt chocolate is open at ALL times and anything and EVERYTHING can get inside without notice from tiny insects to hair of the staff member to someone sneeze without awareness. 4 members of staff all chatting away,  one of them on the phone sending voice messages on WhatsApp, the other was picking her Christmas chocolates and telling to scan them for her to the others , at least one said maybe we should wait when the que is gone. I was 4th in the que , only 2 ppl were buying coffees and other 2 only paying for some chocolates. I waited there almost 15min which absolutely ridiculous considering it was only 4 ppl ahead of me and only 2 actually buying coffee ,with having 4 staff members working too . Prices are high but but best quality Worth for money you spend. Just love butlers Hot chocolate The cold evenings make hot chocolate the perfect drink. Tried the cookie hot chocolate and the dark hot chocolate, both were loved. The staff let us choose a chocolate each with the hot chocolates, which was super cute. Im not the sort of person who enjoys hot chocolate but I absolutely loved how it tasted. Lovely coffee. I love their cafe and chocolate. A nice hot chocolate on a cold evening. There are no seats and usually a queue to gain entry, but service is quick and its worth the wait. A variety of hot beverages for sale and come with a complimentary chocolate If I could just leave a review with the following two words I would: White mocha The white mocha here is probably the best not-legit-coffee coffee Ive had. The free chocolate every time is the cherry on top. I love stopping by here on my way to meet up with some friends. They have a large selection of boxed chocolates too for presents or just your savage self, and the walls are usually covered in mirrors, allowing you to perform a sneaky hair adjustment if needed...I shouldve left that last part out... Its all good stuff, but remember - white mocha. The hot chocolates are perfection! Coffees not as sweet as Id like them. But you get a complimentary chocolate so youre sorted. In general Butlers is the perfect place to bring your friend if theyre visiting Ireland. Thier interiors are always classy and will leave a sweet impression. And come on; Irish chocolate is the BEST. Love Butlers, but some staff at this location ar extremely rude, especially a woman called Lydia I think. Always has a grumpy face and answers rudely to customers. Others such as Federico and the bald guy are super nice. I love Butlers Chocolate in general. On top of this, last Friday evening it was almost closing time and the woman at the counter was very patient with my order and provided exceptional service. Thank for this! Best Chocolate in Dublin. They do great coffee and hot chocolate. My favorite is their Mocha they use real chocolate in it. They have locations all over Dublin and you get a free chocolate sweet with every coffee. I am disappointed lately as they always close their stores 10 - 15 minutes early. Their chocolate based products are good. Agile service and competent prices. The place is small and can be uncomfortable if there are many people waiting. The coffee is so nice and the free chocolate is an added bonus. Very good value Tasted lovely samples at the train station   very delicious caramels truffles chocolates to give as gifts! The hot chocolate is basically milk with nesquik inside. And be careful if you ask for something vegan because they gave me a milk chocolate praline (after telling me it was vegan) and a dairy milk  hot chocolate . Definetely not worth the price. Coffee was great but the staff was not good and she dropped the chocolate after that she pretended she didn t drop it . same chocolate hand over to me Theres an employee named Bruna. Congratulations and thank you very much for being so smiling even in the early hours of the morning. Kruno made us the best hot chocolate ever! I m a fan of butlers since 2 years and today was a different experience altogether. Maria was very helpful in sharing information. Thank you for making our day Nice cafe with the best hot chocolate we had during our trip. We took two Butlers hot chocolate and it was truly delicious. Not as sweet and thick as an Italian hot chocolate but thick enough to be good. The hot chocolate (milk chocolate probably) was strong in flavors and marvelous. With your beverage you can choose a piece of chocolate and I took the crunchy praline which was really good. A little bit too sweet but hey, its praline after all. I would have like to try the other recipes but one cup was more than enough. I dont know if whipped cream would have been better. I thought it was disappointing that the staff didnt take the time to provide a better service even if there were no one when we arrived. We were kinda lost but the staff was cold and not friendly at all so we juste ordered in a hurry, without having the time to study properly the menu. The venue was nice on the bar part but the tables and seats were kinda average, with no decoration. We didnt felt cosy so we just finished our beverages fast and left. Its a nice place to order a hot chocolate since its really good, but I dont recommend that you sat here since its not really warm and cosy. The price is acceptable. Nearly 5  for a hot chocolate; for this quality its not that expensive. I dont know if the other Butlers Chocolate cafe are better but there are a lot of cafe (with seats or no) in the center of Dublin. Just hope that the service is warmer elsewhere. Not giving 5 starts just because of one staff. Most of the staffs are great, except for a very unfriendly girl named Laura, or Lara, not sure. So if you are going just for the chocolate and beverages extremely recommend, if you are looking for a friendly place to have a coffee avoid the place when she is there at least. Butlers coffee is always delicious. Friendly service makes it even better I love your coffee, but the service at Butlers Chocolate Cafe, Liffey Street is terrible. There is a tall, gray-haired employee who is extremely rude to everyone (customers and employees). I dont know if hes responsible for the store, if so, its a shame to have someone with that behavior on the team. Yesterday I went to order a coffee and he was clearly in a bad mood and with a contemptuous face he said he didnt hear me, I repeated it 3 times and even his co-worker heard it, but he continued pretending he didnt hear it . I was so outraged by his behavior that I gave up drinking coffee. At such a delicate time for commerce and with so many people looking for job opportunities, I think that a person like this adds absolutely nothing to the company. Its a small and busy coffee shop. It is possible to get your order for takeaway. Staff members are nice and friendly. The coffee, cappuccino are really good. The hot chocolate is made of real chocolate, very nice. Also a great place to get a box of chocolate as a gift for a special occasion. The venue gets crowded very quick and then its hard to have a conversation (kinda feels like on the luas/bus in the morning). The woman gave us a lot of assistance picking the right coffee with no allergients. Bravo. Great coffee and staff are friendly,  amazing that opens at 8am. very nice place to visit for a treat great drinks nice cakes and a couple of chocolates as well doing some work on the road outside so a bit tricky to access Food Nice friendly staff & central location & u allways get a chocolate sweet with a cup of cappuccino   nice stop in between shoppings   it might get overcrowded in the middle of the day though and u ll be lucky to find a seat there Not sure why you would buy coffee anywhere else when you ll get a cute little heart latte art and your choice of delicious chocolate truffle to accompany it. What an ingenious idea Outstanding place! We went with my mother and we loved their chocolates and the hot chocolate was to die for! If you are on a trip there, you cannot miss their deliciousness! Amazing hot chocolate. They offer oat milk as well as soy for vegans. In this one you can also sit down both inside and outside. Its fairly priced for the area. We had the Butlers hot chocolate and we really enjoyed it. You can also buy gift boxes of chocolates here. You can get your drink/food to take away. There is a toilet (for customers) which you have to ask to get the key for. Very classy cafe with delicious drinks and chocolates, helpful staff. We had an Oreo milshake and hot chocolate caramel. Pure delight and inexpensive for the quality offered Buy a couple of the showcase chocolates and Order one of their Fabulous Hot Chocolates you will not regret mixing the Two. Buy a couple of the Take Home Gift Packs for family and friends to experience these yummy Irish Chocolates To be honest  this place need an update I am regular  customer  in this place there is one guy his name is Denis. he never smile or  welcoming  customers ,  always have face on him . Excellent chocolate and coffee alike, go here if youd like something unique to start out the day.  The chai latte was excellent, and the hot chocolate had what I believe was a bit of Irish cream, a welcome introduction to ones first day in Ireland. Amazing coffees and chocolates. Huge line though, missing a lot of cakes in the shelf s.. they definitely need more staff. The butlers chocolate is really tasty, but the coffee beverages are of low quality. It could be due to the inexperience of the staff making, or a problem with the coffee machine. Plus, the latte was served in a cracked glass. Unfortunately the cafe house at this location is not recommended The best hot chocolate I had in Dublin. Period. With a chocolate to boot. Not the cheapest, but definitely worth every penny. Great cafe shop with friendly staff who preparing a good coffee with chocolate treat . Help with a choice of chocolate for presents . Shop is always tidy and welcome . Vegetarian options: They have at least 2 vegetarian cakes which taste pretty good Chocolate Ecstasy! A superb coco goodness found in the City Center of Dublin. The Hot Chocolate Drink was a great treat for me. I have also tried the Praline drink.. I tell you.. its legendary! Try out their pastries too. My favorites are the Portuguese Tarts! Visit the Cafe when touring in Dublin City Center! The staff were very rude to my partner and I when making our order. When the drink was ready they didnt tell us and when asked, wouldnt give us a clear answer before walking off. Summary: The coffee was good The staff need customer service training. Update 2 weeks later: even though Butlers asked me to email them to discuss what happened I havent heard anything back from them at all after sending them all the information they wanted very disappointed in their customer care. Store wasnt too busy when I entered but I was a bit long waiting on my milkshake - almost 10 minutes. Other customers that ordered after me got served before me. The Oreo milkshake was nice though but it wasnt served with whipped cream nor was I asked for it. I have been to this place once but it is certain I will never come back! The food and chocolate were good but we have arrived and took order, then 5 minutes after we have been told that the place will close after 10 minutes! We were shocked that the waiter didnt warn us of that little detail when we ordered. That guy acted so bad, I discourage strongly to go here! Hot chocolate was not hot, maybe because of cold weather.. overall a nice experience really amazing and delicious cassio is so kind and really profesional but sometime is a girl her name is irina how I find quite rude! i loyal client in mind 2 times a day and every day. and is so nice when early morning you get there and there are nice but just that girl really rude.dessapointed Lovely coffee shop with very welcoming staff, ready to help you. Highly recommend. Sweetest staff ever! Gave me a free chocolate along with my hot chocolate I bought. It was a pretty rainy and cold day and the hot chocolate was a blessing in the disguise of a simple paper cup. Check them out to satisfy your chocolate cravings. I personally suggest Butlers Hot chocolate and white chocolate, both of which i thoroughly enjoyed in both my visits. Cheers! Worst customer service. Terribly slow. Just happened: 4 people in. One person before me. But the dumb and ignorant guy served a couple that just walked in. I asked if I was transparent and I said it was my turn. Not a sorry, just mumbled nonsense. I left the shop. Is not the first time that I experienced a bad service but now I had enough!!! Shame on you! Went in today to get a dark hot chocolate for the first time in ages. I put up a review previously saying how unhappy I was that their dark chocolate was watered down and I had a good few that were literally white in a few location. Your team reached out and refunded the drinks and I thought that was very kind. Today the dark hot chocolate I had was creamy, thick, like drinking a liquid brownie with a slight bitter edge, fabulous. I really appreciate how lovely the staff were  even though I walked in during a very busy period when it was completely full. Thank you!!! Butlers Chocolate Cafe make and sell great coffee, super handmade chocolates and lovely snacks. Great for purchasing gifts and for me tge best is the coffee. I always enjoy a coffee in a Butlers Cafe. An Irish high street chain of stores, always a treat to visit, certainly a unique offering that other Cafes cannot match. Butlers chocolate cafe is such a lovely place. They have a big range of different types of coffees and ice coffees. With every coffee you buy you get a complimentary chocolate of your choice.  Will definitely be going back Called in for a coffee whilst visiting Dublin and for my sister to spoil herself with a box of chocolates.  The free sample we got with the coffee... Whilst nice was too sweet for me.   She loved it and treated herself Great service and excellent deserts + chocolate truffles. Tables and seats could be nicer. Lovely place with very good customer service. Loads of chocolates and good coffee as well! We stopped in to buy some delicious and delightful chocolates.  Loved the hot chocolate and Efie could not have been more helpful  when choosing from the vast range of chocolates to bring home. Very nice cafe, the drinks have a real chocolate taste and are very popular when its cold! Plus you have the right to choose two chocolates when you have a drink and they are very good! LOVE Butlers!! More than peeved that I cant find any back home in England!! Hot chocolate is nice! The coffee shop is one of the Butlers chocolate outlets and as such is of the same high quality and delicious flavour. The coffee shop is very well organized and very fast service when full.  As well as coffee and treats you can buy large quantities of butlers chocolate here also. The reason its not 5 star is because a window display prevents a counter to sit at and watch out the window at Liffey street as the people rush across the city. There are tables outside in dry weather."
23,Cafe Crema,4.325,"Got some Gluten free food here for my wife that we couldnt find in 2 or 3 other places. Wasnt much, nothing fancy but the service was good, friendly and helpful and the food was fine. The Gluten free carrot cake was nice. Food Quant little cafe with a good range of foods. Everything is affordable, with a coffee, cake and panini coming into to under  15. Atmosphere is pretty quiet in the mornings, so great for anyone who needs to get any work done Weve been in here several times before, my friends and I, and they are always so accommodating. There were 8 or 9 of us today, plus a guide dog. They put tables together so that we could all eat together. Its small and cosy - but it looks smaller from the outside. Theres some seating down the back, making the place much bigger. The food is reasonably priced, a good amount for the price so good value and the staff are so friendly and helpful. The staff are so pleasant and the food is prepared really quickly and to a high standard. Always a lovely place to grab a bite to eat. Would recommend the salmon bagel! Great little cafe on middle Abbey Street in Dublin. With the usual cafe pastries etc and  decent meals on the menu, not to mention the great coffee, this venue is well worth a visit. Staff are friendly and efficient in a warm setting that is both clean and airy. Nice place for a quiet chat or a full on dinner. #Dublin #dublinireland #dublinstreets #dublinstagram #dublincity #dublinfood #dublinphotographer #dublinpub #dublinfoodie #discoverdublin #dublinrestaurants #dublinreviews #visitdublin This place is great, the staff is friendly. A little background music too. We stayed for 4 hours chatting in the warmth, drawing and eating. I recommend :) Really enjoyed the omelette and green tea. Staff are very friendly. You should totally try the Pina Co latte! Its the best coffee in the entire universe! The service here is impeccable. Nice little cafe tucked into a side street not far off O Connell street. Staff really polite and food came quickly. Like the touch of little biscoff cookies given with each drink. The food was really nice and reasonably priced at 17 euro for a tea, mocha, plus the bagel and cake. Cannot fault. Went in on spec because somewhere else was full. More than pleasantly surprised. Quite a good daytime menu at very reasonable prices for a city centre eatery, atmosphere pretty good, the toilets were spotless. Will definitely be back. A cafe that stays open until 7:30 p.m.! Very nice to relax, read or study since it closes later than the other cafes in town. Located in the city center, the staff is very friendly and the prices are fair ( 3.60 per latte). I recommend if you like spending time in cafes. Beautiful wee place, such friendly staff, stunning fry good quality meat. Love it. Love this place. Never disappoints. Great cafe food. Always great service. Even the tunes. My go to place for breakfast or brunch everytime Im in the city center. Highly reccomend. Stumbled upon this place years ago and have been coming back ever since whenever in town. Vegetable soup is unreal and the staff are top class. Staff were lovely and it was genuinely the best latte I ve ever had for a reasonable price Went there to see a friend and have Pot of tea and a scone and jam was very Good must very tasty must say Food : 4/5 For one bacon, one sausage, one egg and water young man charged me  10.75 Literally  what you can see on the photo and nothing else at this place cost  10.75 Food : 1/5 Great coffee  amazing music playing!! Made the experience very enjoyable If you like The Killers and Red Hot Chili Peppers, this is the place for you! Our thanks to Cafe Crema for offering us our first irish breakfast. It was lovely and tasteful. The coffee was amazing, the first americano that showed me that coffee can give you pleasure and taste good, even raw. But it was just the first of many coffees in Dublin that were amazing. Sitting then at the outside tables, seeying and hearing the city go by, really added to the experience. My recommendation for a stop at Cafe Crema when in the center. Great cafe, high quality coffee , ambience was good , service could improve. Id recommend this place to others. Good coffee and hot chocolate to have on the go near O Connell street in this cute little cafe. A nice place for lunch while visiting from Edinburgh. Lovely staff, good food (chicken wrap & soup of the day) and very reasonably priced compared to some other nearby cafe s / restaurants. Will definitely be back The decor is very dated as are all the fixtures and fittings. Theres a general air of neglect about the place. The hygiene isent great and some of the staff were quite scruffy. The coke was warm and the food just ok. Wont be back. The only saving grace was the girl who served us was very nice and a credit to the place. I always found this cafe a nice place to visit over time. It had a nice wee atmosphere. Called in earlier today. Staff member was indifferent & seemed to have an attitude. Service wasnt as before.  Unfriendly with a I couldnt care less attitude. Pity. Well -there are other places to go to. Cosy little cafe in the heart of Dublin. Friendly staff and honest food Lovely cafe and we just stopped off for a coffee, a tea and a rest. The staff were friendly and prices were fair. Cant comment on the food and hence a 3 buy it look fresh and inviting. They dont have many vegetarian options. Theres three things. I tried the tomato and cheese toast which was quite nice. They also keep herbal teas like lemon and ginger and peppermint for people who try avoid caffeine like me. Lovely food and staff. Would recommend for lunch Been here a few times but wont be back. Ordered a breakfast which took half an hour to come 3 staff behind the counter. The beans were terrible tasted so cheap and bad worst beans ever. Making someone wait half an hour for something so basic is a joke. I was about to ask for my money back before the food arrived. Disappointing because its a comfortable place. But food and staff not up to scratch. A class little cafe with a super atmosphere just off o Connell Street, the breakfast is a super feed, they do a super selection of lovely cakes, the coffee is super and they also do a nice sized pot of tea, the service is top quality and the staff are always friendly chatty and helpful! I love this spot Lovely cafe, clean lovely staff, very polite. Food was perfect! Full cooked breakfast, toast marmalade, tea or coffee 11.95euros. visited twice in four days. Well worth a visit. Nice little cafe in the centre, good place to go if youre looking for a quick, freshly made sandwich. Nothing too fancy, nothing too complicated, a good old school style cafe My favorite cafeteria in Dublin. Good to know they survived the COVID madness. They play High School Musical here. Breakfast was great! Might come back later for karaoke Nice cafe with thin easy reach of OConnell St. Good choice of panini,etc. Great for breakfast / brunch. Easily accessible. Clean environment. Nice food. Very nice folks here. Had excellent small breakfast for a very reasonable price (for the most expensive city in Ireland) Nice food and lovely cup of tea. Staff very friendly  and pleasant. Reasonably priced. One of the few places left in Dublin Im happy to just sit and work for hours.  Its cozy, the coffee is good and good value also, and the staff are lovely.  The only place to get a decent coffee later in the afternoon when lesser cafes have shut.  My go to when Im tired, hungry or bored in Dublin. Lovely people. Great food. The price is about as good as youd get in Dublin. I usually get an Irish Breakfast there that would fill you up no problem. Lasagne wasnt bad either"
24,Cafe Lisboa,4.9,"Few times in cafe Lisbon now ,plane always amazing me . I was impressed with service and staff even in busy hours. they were very welcoming and friendly, the cafe atrocious is nice and relaxed . Menu price was great value , food was  luscious , rich with flavours and traditional , Bring a little bit of the Portuguese culture to Dublin s . Lovely coffe place in the middle of dublin. When you enter you are greeted by a warm atmosphere and a friendly service. The coffee is beautifully served and very delicious. The snacks are also super tasty. Perfect spot to have a quiet coffee or read a book. Small nook in a quiet street. Almond croissant was excellent, soft and heavy but not overly sweet. Same with the chocolate croissant. The tart was one of the best tarts Ive had outside or Porto. Food I went for dinner with my husband and was AMAZING! All dishes were really tasty, delicious portugues wine, beautiful presentation and outstanding service. Definitely we recommend! My favorite cafe in Dublin. Better than Lisbon itself. The owners are so friendly, I always enjoy having a small chat with them every time I visit. This care is reflected in their delicious pastel de nata, and carefully crafted coffee. I have never been disappointed after coming here, and always recommend somebody looking for a cafe to come here. I came here for breakfast cos I wanted something different and a bit more particular. I tried the pastel de nata, which were good, really not bad for being in Dublin!! The coffee was really good as well. Overall a nice quiet place to have a nice breakfast with some Portugal vibes! Will come back! Super cute little spot, well executed style. The chocolate croissant was absolutely phenomenal. Good coffee and super sweet staff. They also have toasties which I did not try but they looked tasty. Gorgeous little cafe with beautiful custard tarts. Like being in Lisbon! Good value too! Amazing, Delicious and Welcoming are the words that summarize my experience at this charming coffee shop. Their toasted are very yummy and the Pastel De Natas are bites from heaven. The staff was very kind and helpful and I wish I had had more mornings to had visited them more. If you are looking for a down to earth atmosphere and delicious tasting food, pay these folks a visit and you won t regret it! Great pastel de nata! They also have some options of croissants and coffees! Service is good and the place is gorgeous! This place does not disappoint!  The pastel was simply amazing and the coffee divine!  Lovely staff, authentic experience, will come here again! We got 2 different egg tarts (one with jam and one without) and they both tasted great! The mocha and chai latte are also very good! The chicken and cheese toast is huge and very flavorful. The price is very reasonable in this area of Dublin. Ill say it right at the start, two friends with me- a German and a Dutch guy, loved it a lot and said that theyd give it 5 star. For me it was small basic place with simple and nice stuff. I had Pastel De Nata with Latte. Nata was simple sweet and nice, but tbh I couldnt tell the difference between this and the one in Lidl  . Maybe my tongue receptors arent that much developed     . Or maybe they are kind of same. In any case, simple and nice place where interestingly lot of people come to have a nice and lovely time. They must be doing something right I guess A new place in Dublin. Ordered there two espresso and 3 pastel de nata. The place was very busy and I got coffee immediately, however i had to wait for the rest of the order around 30m because the person that took my order forgot about it. I asked another person after 15m waiting, however she also forgot about it :-) It is a nice place just u need to get the earlier or not in a busy time, cus you might not get a place to sit etc. Summarising, the coffee is strong but nice and pastel de nata lovely. It is nice to have a such place in Dublin. First time visit. Mid morning. Really impressed with the quality of coffee and pastel de nata. Will definitely be back to try more. Food : 5/5 Word of mouth and positive feedback from co-workers led me to check out this cafe in central Dublin which was phenomenally good. There s a very warm and welcoming atmosphere here at Cafe Lisboa with its very homely decor. Moreover, the pastel de nata, paired with their delicious cups of coffee which was served by friendly members of the cafe s staff, are simply outstanding. It s not surprising that Cafe Lisboa is a success. A true gem in central Dublin! cozy location in the heart of the city, you can find a corner of Portugal close to you. The pastel de nata, cappuccino, and coffee are all delicious. staff was friendly and efficient. Finally got pasteis de nata from here and they rival those found in Lisbon. Cute little coffee shop despite being small. Great to see how busy it was as a small, independent business. The pastel was very good - not too sweet, crisp pastry, just-set custard. It would almost make me choose it over a Cantonese style daan tat. Almost. Super cute cafe with warm Pastel de Nata, portuguese Delta coffee and sandwiches. They now serve tapas style dinner with wine and sangria Friday and Saturdays! Food Very nice natas, one of the best I have had. The pastry is well cooked and flaky but they are just slightly too sweet in my opinion and makes them taste a bit like those cheaper ones you find in the shops. The first Portuguese cafe in Dublin! It has the BEST Pastel de Nata you can find in the city (trust me, Im Portuguese and Ive looked everywhere) !! cosy cafe with great soundtrack from Classic Portuguese artists, best espressos and they also do delicious Ice Coffee !! go Go GO !! Definitely this place will save our time not to go to Lisbon and get nice Portuguese tarts here in Dublin! We bought 6 pack and took them home. Kept them in the fridge overnight and heated them with air fryer. Still very nice and tasted authentic as we had in Lisbon. great chai latte and cappuccino    also great pastries and amazing service! The best Pastel de Nata I ve had since my trip to Lisbon! Pastry was so flakey and the custard was delicious! Staff are so lovely also. Coffee amazing too. Will definitely be back I love this little place. It s prefect for a little pitstop The natas are fresh and the coffee is great too. The staff are so friendly, I want to come back and try their evening menu this place is so good. the staff and the food are amazing, a warm hug in dublin city. Quiet and chilled vibes on a Friday morning. Everything was delish, coffee was sooooo good Was excellent,  looked at the other reviews and said yes lets go. A bit quiet, but really friendly, will be back. Coffee excellent and also beautiful fresh Pastel De Nata , 5 Stars Food Beautiful spot to enjoy a coffee away from the bustle of Henry St. Best pastel de nata I have ever tasted Best croissant I had in Dublin. The latte was also great. Nice place to sit and enjoy. Saw lots of other stuff I would like to try. Hope I make it back. Stumbled upon this quaint cafe in the back streets of Dublin and I was so happy we found it. Very good coffee and very good service. Lovely place for a quiet morning coffee As a family, our experience in the spot was just great. Excellent food, service and environment. We highly recommend a visit. Lovely quiet spot for a coffee and delicious pastel de nata. Great for sitting in or for take-away to help the time in the office a little sweeter. Busy place with great coffee and equally, if not better, Portuguese treats! I tried the pastel de nata (warmed up  ) and the Portuguese Swiss style roll. Both very good. Definitely recommend and will be back! Update June 2024 - still a great place! And starting the day with coffee and a pastel de nata from Cafe Lisboa, always makes for a great day Great Pastel de Nata, the taste is sweet and really complement the coffee that we order at that day. The environment was really authentic which is the strong point of this coffee shop as well. Absolutely incredible pasteis de nata   They were still warm when I got them! Tasted amazing - soft, smooth, sweet and with a slight crunch in the pastry. A real treat, I will be back! Lovely little cafe shop, authentic Pastel de Nata cakes and coffee bikka shots as in Portugal we get. Nice strong coffee, cappuccinos. Only downside the shop is very tiny, too small. Not enough seats, tables, and no outside seats. Recommend! The best place in Dublin for a Pastel de Nata!  The staff is amazing and the space is very cozy! Great atmosphere! Sergio is very friendly and always makes us feel welcome! Could not recommend more! Love this little cafe, the pastel de nata are insanely delicious and the coffee was perfect. I highly recommend this place, staff were really friendly as well :) One of Dublins best small cafes. Do yourself a favour and try it. Coffee is great, pastries and sausage rolls are excellent and their sandwiches are some of the best in the city. They also have really good vegan options. The staff are so nice and really friendly. Highly recommended. Vegetarian options: Lots of vegan and veggie options"
25,Cafe Vivaldi,3.4,"Arrived from Canada still on EST time. Tried to come here around 11 pm (supper time in Canada) to eat with my daughter, it was pouring raining. They turned me away saying the kitchen was closed, only drinks and they were closing soon. I ordered at the take out place across the street and saw someone go in and get seated. We went over with our takeout and asked if we could sit there because it was pouring, I said I would order whatever the drink minimum was. They turned us away again. So much for kid friendly. Its an stunning spot to grab a cup of tea and enjoy Temple Bars view. Definitely, Its a must visit place.The waitress Isabela is excellent! Shes so kind and friendly. Food was very tasty and the portion is perfect. Very friendly and kind staff and reasonable prices. I ordered a pizza for 12  - and all I got a frozen pizza and tasted like this!  They dont have even a kitchen, food will be prepared somewhere else. Also the bufala was no buffalo cheese at all. Stay away from this place! This is a real tourist trap! If you love GB but still want good coffee: come here. also amazing really friendly staff and best Aperol Spritz. Breakfast is good too ;) Best Espresso in Dublin (and i had lots of it).. maybe one of the most underated places in the temple bar area... by the way also the best aperol spritz you will find in dublin... tastes like an aperol in italy... i cant understand the negative postings... stuff is very friendly.... if you ever been in brazil or portugal... thats simply the way its doing over there... i dont care about the enviroment... but i defo care about the quality of drinks and service and thats simply great.... obrigado Excellent service. Tasty food. I will be back. Ive been here a few times, its a cute little outdoor seating Cafe, smoker friendly. Its a good place to people watch with roof covering and heat lamps. Staff are always nice and food is good and not too expensive, usually around  30 for 2 people. The owner gave my fiance a free apple pie, since it was his birthday. I dont know what people are talking about food being prepped elsewhere, I never saw that happen. Would definitely recommend :) I was afraid that it would really be a tourist trap once we sat down, but we ate very well and the waiter and the owner were friendly. The only point to improve is cleanliness (toilets in particular, which reflects the behavior of an establishment). Good value for money We enjoyed our dinner there very much, food was good and there was a pretty good offer that included a big burger and a pint for 13e. Plus, the waitress was super friendly and, since she made us switch to another table in the beginning, she gave us a slice of apple pie for free. Yummy! Delicious food, well priced (especially for the heart of Temple bar) and quick service. Highly recommended. The outdoor seating is a great bonus plus there is a heater and coverage for if its cold or raining. A horrible place, my friend and I ordered a lasagna and his came half full, we asked the staff to change and fix the problem, but the Italian guy was totally rude, he said if my friend and I were bothered with the size, it was to take a picture and go to another restaurant that was supposed to be the same owner and show it to him. I wouldnt recommend anyone to go there, this Italian guy was totally nasty and horrible. So disappointed, service was awful, staff were in no way friendly, they spent more time talking to each other rather than looking after customers We were told it would take 20 minutes for the food to come because  the kitchen is very busy   but there was absolutely no other customer at the Cafe at the time. I got a breakfast bagel, was hilarious, an ordinary bagel with goats cheese on the side costed  5.95, joke!  It was as if they bought a packet of bagels in Tesco and just added some cheese! Total tourist trap, avoid!!! Unfortunately the seafood soup was the worst Ive had in Ireland, did not finish it. My husband had the beef stew and said it was ok but was not as good as he had elsewhere on our trip. Outdoor seating is a plus for this restaurant in the summer since indoor eating is often hotter than the outdoor temperature. Lovely burger. And the best Guinness I have ever had! This cafe is located in the Temple Bar district. Its a terraced Al Fresco cafe - the tables are out on the street, covered by what looks like a temporary roof structure. When I visited, the cafe was draughty and a bit cold, though  they have some electric heaters installed. I had Seafood Chowder for lunch, which lacked any real flavour, disappointing. Reached for the pepper, which had whole peppercorns, but no grinder! Had to wait 15 minutes for the chowder, though the place was almost empty. The waiter apologised though, and gave me a free coffee. Service was poor, the waiter spent most of his time chatting with other staff member (the cook I think) and largely ignore the few customers he had. Disappointing.... All the stuff is lovely and Ive been so comfortable all the times I went until now. Today one of the guys had a really bad actitude with us. I feel bad because I really like the place but I will never go again. Excellent venue in the centre of templebar. The woman running the cafe was very friendly and the waiters were great as well. Food was excellent and service from waiters was top notch. I ordered what was supposed to be a half pound burger of irish beef. And what it really was were two separate hamburgers on cheap bread and a bit of lettuce. You eat the same thing at burger king, did not taste like authentic irish beef. Very bad food chicken wings burn for outside and undercook for inside.. beer without gas we ask to change the food and the beer and they give us exactly the same dish and the same beers.. the already lost  2 frenquently customers.. the onwner or manager very rude!!!! If you want spent 20 euros for nothing this is the correct place ! I ordered Irish Coffee, and it was horrible. Asked if they forgot an ingredient or smth and they brought another. It was as bad. It was made in instant coffee without mixing it, therefore all the coffee powder was still in the glass.. Horrible taste. The food here was really good, and the service was very friendly and helpful. If you get a chance, you should definitely stop here to eat. We ate a real Bacon Cheese Burger.... from the McDonalds next door. The anti-emetic tablet typical of McDonalds bread, the very finely chopped salad, the recognizable McDonalds fries.. Scandalous Tourist traps: frozen pizza, cheeseburger with overcooked steak. Only funny point: being served by the Pierre Croce lookalike who was friendly. Very expensive for what it is, cold cheeseburger, it came straight from the McDonalds next door. Very disapointed. Nice food and location but very poor environment. Old chairs, dirty windows, duct tape all over the place. I love the food at this place, great prices, a perfect location (in the heart of Dublin), good service. Excellent both the food and the welcome. Food is good price but not high-end. Location is perfect for outdoor temple bar people watching Not too expensive, given the fact it is  in a very touristy area. Beef stew tastes good and the staff is really friendly Cheap food, served by unexperienced young staff dressed with random clothes 30  for 2 breakfasts, 100% microwave cooked . Crappy place Waiter was really attentive and good food was grand overpriced but its Dublin so Id expect that We enjoyed fish and chips and a Guinness. Fair value for money. Nice enough at pot. Right in the center of Temple Bar and with good prices. They make a deadly Irish Coffee. According to my son Best pancakes breakfast ever Tourist trap, but welcoming staff, for the rest its a simple snack Bang on for a hearty breakfast. Can recommend, the food was excellent. Youve never eaten something richer than their rich chocolate cake :) Resonable prices in the middle of Temple, food is tasty and the service was nice and fast. Nice staff nice food great value and a great pint of Guinness"
26,Cafe en Seine,4.525,"Just popped in for a quick soup and a pint for lunch. It was a pleasant modern ambiance, with ample space. Had a large bar and a big menu. The lunch was quite pricey just for soup, and the pint was typical Dublin silly expensive. Overall, a fine experience. Service was accommodating as I had to move out quickly and needed the check expedited. Was in Dublin twice recently and found this gem. Beautiful inside and very classy. The staff are very attentive and professional, great service. We had lunch of a French dip sandwich and a turkey and brie sandwich with chips. The food here was exceptional which is why we returned for dinner a week later. Yet again the food was good, steak and himself had gnocchi. On both occasions the place was busy and unfortunately was given a time to vacate by. Understandable as they need the table. We also came back for drinks one afternoon and the cocktails were good. Would definitely be back. Came back for lunch on a Saturday and got the crab brioche rolls with chips. Absolutely divine. Only problem was that once we were finished it felt like we were rushed out the door. Arrived, ate and gone within 35 minutes. My first visit to this iconic venue was almost 30 years ago, so my  second visit on 22/6/24 held many surprises. This innovative chameleon venue has undergone an enormous make over and refurbishment about 6 years ago. The art deco / nouveau theme is still intact but a modern twist has been added with a  faux cafe street  now sitting where the dance floor and balcony once were. It still has its love story appeal, and  has embraced her  twentieth century makeover with grace. For me it is one of my all time favourite venues, I salute its ability to gently transform from an elegant lunch time meet to an afternoon tea delight then into a cocktail destination by early evening and a bustling night time party place until the wee small hours. We arrived as it opened at 11.30 hrs, every member of staff we encountered were professional and ensured our visit was not only a good experience but a memorable one too. The service was approximately timed, we weren t rushed and our 2 hour lunch felt relaxed and enjoyable. My Vegan bowl comprised Quinoa & Edamame, Cabbage Slaw, Cajun Sweet Potato, Avocado, Curry Spiced Cauliflower, Ranch Dressing, Rocket, Toasted Seeds  & I added Buttermilk Chicken, was an absolute delight to the taste buds. We also enjoyed eggs Royale, the Eggs were poached to perfection and enhanced with Spinach, Hash Browns, Ballycotton Smoked Salmon, Hollandaise, Rocket Salad . I liked the addition of water brought to our table without request although the faux Parisian street was something of a surprise. I didn t figure on the make over! However the retractable roof is a novel addition which allows the outside in, which was closed as the wind picked up. It was wonderful to revisit Cafe Em Seine, although I didn t appreciate at the time of booking my last visit was almost 30 years ago. It was interesting to have a wander and explore the new decor on the various levels. Thank you Cafe En Seine for a delicious birthday lunch and the next time I m in Dublin, I will come and visit you again. Hopefully it won t be 30 years before we next meet. Swanky bar and restaurant that served its purpose perfectly. We popped in and luckily grabbed two seats at the crowded bar. the bartenders were extremely friendly and helpful, and the drinks were great. Once we looked into trying to potentially eat at the restaurant, it seemed way too busy and too much of a hassle to be worth the effort, so we went elsewhere for dinner. But for pre-dinner drinks, it was perfect! Fun cocktail bar in Dublin. Well worth the visit if you are in the area. Wide selection of drinks and good service.  Interesting atmosphere that is different than most places in the area. The outer seating area is lined with books, giving it a different vibe. The food was incredibly delicious, and the drinks were a must-try. The French Martini was one of the best Ive ever had! The service was amazing as well. Lovely staff and atmosphere . The fish and chips was so nice and in nice portion . The fish was fresh not that dry . The gambas was lovely it is dipoed in too much sauce but its lovely. You can never go wrong with a chicken wings it was so nice with its blue cheese dip. Stunning and massive place very central. We had breakfast there but I bet it s amazing in the evening for cocktails. Roof terrace, indoor courtyard French style. Like a Tardis - it s huge! Great vibe Me and my friend came in on a Tuesday night and wanted to get some different cocktails that we never had. We decided to test the bartender Matthew, and who we soon found out to be his brother Gavin, on some peculiar cocktails we found online. To say they were the most interesting and delicious cocktails we ve ever had is an understatement!! Will definitely be coming back again :) Gorgeous cocktail bar! We were expertly looked after by knowledgeable bar tenders who took so much pride in their creations.  The theatre of it all was an added bonus. The venue features an engaging decor and distinct spaces for enjoying a nice dinner or hitting the dance floor for some fun. At night, the lively music sets the perfect backdrop for guests to indulge in a good selection of beers and cocktails served at the bar. Gorgeous ! From the moment you enter you know that you are in a unique place. The decoration is perfect and the cozy atmosphere makes you want to stay warm and enjoy a hot chocolate + marshmallows or a pint of Guiness with friends. I recommend it. Parking: Quite difficult to park nearby. Wheelchair accessibility: Yes because there is no stop in the entrance and the large main room is on the ground floor. Awesome find in Dublin! Was visiting and wanted a certain whisky which they had! Staff were very friendly! Not cheap but worth it Food was really good, I got the steak and it was super tender and flavourful. The staff were amazing, really attentive, and super friendly. The atmosphere and decoration was great also. First time in Cafe en Seine, was always hesitant to come in. Our server Matthew and Gavin were friendly and accommodating. We are not big cocktail drinkers but heard this was a good spot, we asked for recommendations and they gave us a clover club and spicy paloma. We were so happy with our drinks and the atmosphere was amazing! Will 100% be back! We attended this venue as a large crowd for a business dinner. We had over 30 people. The service from where I was in the group was fast and efficient, and every was smooth and no issue. The food was exceptional and worth a return visit. The place itself is iconic and very beautiful inside. Most certainly would visit again. We came for brunch on a Sunday and the atmosphere was great and there was even life music! To start off we shared the  Vegeterian Antipasto  which was better than we expected and then for mains we got the  Eggs Royale  and the  Turkish Eggs . The latter was just eggs in yogurt and lacked the spiced butter/oil so that was a bit disappointing. We also shared the  Smoked Bacon Mac & Cheese  which was great. To finish off we had the  Lemon Tart  and the  Espresso Ice Cream Sundae . Both were really good! Delightful as always, makes it feel as though the gray rain wont last. Very romantic feeling, as intended. We didnt need a booking after work hours. Came just for drinks. Stumbled upon this place by accident but 100% glad we did. Absolutely lovely place and amazing cocktails. If youre as lucky as we were to be served by Nikolaos (sorry if this is spelt wrong) you will not regret asking his advice on cocktails. Absolute pure gentleman who knows his stuff and an asset to this place for sure Excellence in every aspect: fine food in perfection, friendly service, tasty interior. Highly recommended! Food Came for a drink and nibbles and it was great. Absolutely stunning building and interior design. The cocktails were great, as were the Irish coffees. The table nibbles were lovely and fresh too. Would highly recommend but make sure you book if you want to eat. Art Nouveau restaurant, cafe, bar. Cool place in Dublin. It is better to reserve a table if you want to go out here I had a very disappointing experience here. While celebrating my friends wedding, my purse was stolen from the sofa in the lobby in the few seconds we stood up to cheer for the newlyweds. Although the manager was helpful, it s unbelievable and disappointing that a place like this doesn t have security at the door. There was absolutely no security, and we were robbed on a Wednesday afternoon, not even at night. For this reason, I would not recommend this place you just dont feel safe. One of the best places in Dublin to have dinner or just go for a cocktail. Food was very good and the atmosphere was amazing. Surprisingly, the prices are normal Dublin prices (not crazy expensive as I expected). Would definitely go back! Fabulous place! Service is very prompt and not too much in your face at the same time. Nice music in the background, just at the right volume where its comfortable to hear and be heard. Warm atmosphere, staff are very pleasant. The menu is quite small but the food is delicious. This truffle dish is incredibly delicious! I strongly recommend it. Staff were so kind and friendly with us. If there were more stars, theyd get them. We popped in for lunch. The food was bursting with flavour. Loads of veggie options. Staff were great. The atmosphere and the building made me feel like I was back in Paris. Lovely cocktails. Not too expensive either. Brilliant, you need to go here. Top marks, what else can I say? Great place, good food, excellent staff and lovely atmosphere! The steak was EXCELLENT, and also quite expensive. Its difficult to find places like this one in Dublin, with a fantastic view from the terraces at the top floors. Also, bear in mind that the bill can go up if you start drinking wine or spirits. It has become one of my favorite places in the city :) The food is worth the price and even more. I had a very pleasant evening and ate delicious food. I recommend the Cassoulet and the lemon tart. I felt like the kitchen really wants to give you a good time and not just to feed you. The Art Deco style of the place is a big personal plus! Cibo buonissimo e posto molto ben curato. Ottimo per coppie! Mangiare le alette di pollo e uno spreco, provate tutte le altre ricette! Had a great coffee and the probably the worst cheesecake ever.  . The white chocolate cheesecake has no taste, 2cm x 5 to 6 cm is the slice with an ice cream scoop for 8 euros.. Very naive of me   . Lovely spot though Been here a couple of times, really helpful staff and tasty food. Love the decor and really reminds me a bit of Paris. Cozy enough for a romantic dinner, cheeky drinks, or a business meeting during the day. Wheelchair accessibility: No stairs on ground floor beautiful spot. great food. HOWEVER, we waited 40+ min to get seated for our reservation. they did provide us a round of drinks, for free, to compensate for the wait. finally seated  we ordered and received our starters but then waited 30+ min for the entrees to arrive. it was an obvious delay and they got us some extra drinks for the wait [again]. strange that the wait was so long? maybe because they had 2 events but you would think they would take care of the delayed reservations? the servers were SO rude. we checked the bill before leaving, we were charged for some extra items so we had to get the adjusted. OVERALL, aesthetically beautiful, food good but NOT worth the hype. It s a shame their service was bad. Absolutely loved the ambience, the food, the service. A well executed package. A truly divine experience, from the atmosphere to the food and cocktail to the service. Never quite visited a restaurant like this one before, with Parisian aesthetics with the apartments lining the walls and small cafe s, every inch was photo-worthy. We were seated out in the waiting area for no more than 3 minutes before being guided to a table and provided with a menu. The menu was vivid in choice (and me being me, I opted for the fish and chips) which had a small 10 or so waiting time yet tasted like it was being meticulously watched and perfected. The fish was light and crispy, the chips flavourful and the tartar sauce was delicious. (Also came with lemon and curry) the lemon added a punch to the fish that brought out even more flavour. Whilst scanning the drinks menu, I was a little overwhelmed by the wide array of choices and creative concoctions. Despite this, I noticed no  common  cocktails and had asked my waiter if they had a Pornstar Martini, I was delighted to find out that one could be made for me- and it was stupendous! Waiters go above and beyond to assist you and assure you have a wonderful experience. Will definitely be back again! I was here for brunch and dinner and both times have been lovely. I like their ambience especially in their courtyard where you could have natural sunlight as the roof is glass. Price is okay i think. Brunch is cheaper than dinner. We had antipasto shared platter, risotto, halibut, mimosa and red wine for about 100  not bad! Just make sure to book ahead especially when you plan to go on the weekends The atmosphere and the food was absolutely amazing! The place looks beautiful and is great for larger groups or even dates. I came here with a group of colleagues after work and was pleasantly surprised by how good everything was. But there was two big issues, the non alcoholic options are pretty bad. This is understandable as they are more known for their wine selection, however i had ordered a mocktail which was  11,50. This was just plain sparkling water with a flower in it which was flat after 15 minutes. If you re interested in non alcoholic beverages you re better off ordering a mixer. Another thing was, server Joudy had approached us at the end of our night without approaching us before and had brought us the bill. She was very rude while paying as she had misheard us and thought we weren t going to leave a tip, she said  you re very bad leaving no tip   with an angry impression and attitude. When we had corrected her, which we at this point shouldn t have considering her attitude. She proceeded to smile and say  oh you re not so bad then This had left a weird atmosphere between the colleagues too as we had been having a great time and had ordered a good bit of stuff (food and drink). This behaviour is most definitely not appropriate in any establishment especially in a well known place like this. Hopefully this won t be a reacquiring thing Stopped there for a bite and a drink around 8pm on a friday. I ordered a antipasti platter(17 ) and a cod croquettes(12 ) and a bottle of white wine (34). The service was great, as it should be, also the food. Didnt take too long to be served. Ambient is nice and cozy, good atmosphere for a happy hour or a date. Recommend. We had a get together here. A very wonderful spot close to the city; beautiful indoor/outdoor aesthetics; cocktails are absolutely good. Takes a bit more from your pocket but the service is worth it. A beautiful place in Dublin. also ideal for companies to celebrate annual events or parties. here is an example with the company The Pa Way from the UK. more examples on my website or instagram @emidphoto Very good food. Beautifull place with lots of good spots service could be a bit better Food : 5/5"
27,Caffe Cagliostro,4.725,"Great coffee place. I am a fan of their Cappuccino and Espresso. Their focaccia bread is also nice and fluffy. They have few seats inside and 8 - 10 tables outside. You can sit and relax in the middle of town and enjoy watching city move by. Wow, really good coffee here. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere, highly recommend. The best coffee in all Dublin. I Love it. My favourite place. The staff incredible. Found this place on 3rd day in Dublin.  By far the best coffee in Dublin so far.  Very friendly staff. It feels like I m in Italy!! Highly recommended the hot chocolate Italian style!! Just got my heart This is one of my favourite coffee joint when Im in Dublin City centre. I like to sit at a corner enjoying my coffee while I watch the early morning rush. You can tell the  barista enjoys his job because he was very polite and welcoming. He doesnt look Irish but I his politeness. If youre around Dublin City, Caffe Calgliostro is within the Jervis certer Street from the Luas Stop. A nice cafe, a good cup of coffee. Dessert was a bit pricey but enjoyable Food Best coffee in town! Espresso, cappuccino, macchiato and delicious pastries! The staff is absolutely superb! I cant recommend this place enough! Make sure to pay a visit and have an espresso! Theres not many places you can find Ichnusa in Dublin, food and service both very good! Best coffee in Dublin. Food is amazing. Staff are great. I have been bringing my son to the cafe since he was a baby and the staff have always treated him like a little king. I havent a bad word to say about the place. An Italian friend of mine took me here so came back with my girlfriend  and there coffee is the best Ive ever tasted in my life and she agreed best tasting coffee ever also great selection of cakes to go with it all so tasty. My previous favourite coffee place is no where near as good as here you have you have2 taste it. seats inside and out great service u can see why there are so many Italians at the Caffe. We will be back many times in the future now thank you! Lovely coffee, drinks and food. The staff is amazingly friendly. I feel like Im back in Italy every time I come here. Stopped at this cute corner looking for a treat and was not disappointed: 2 lovely cappuccinos like in Italy, a pastiera napoletana and a big bacio di dama al cioccolato. Sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine. Service was warm and attentive, didnt have to wait. Ill be back soon. Perfect Italian place for your Italian aperitifs! 10euros for a cocktail plus all food you can eat from the buffet. Seems small but they continuously add new food every 30min. I love negroni and Campari Spritz here. On advice from acquaintances, we had breakfast in this very nice cafe. Good background music, excellent cappuccino. To recommend. Recently refurbished - same space but more spacious. Cappuccinos are made properly with correct proportions of coffee and milk. The seating area outside is under the gaze of John Byrnes 2004 excellent public mural of the Last Supper. Anywhere I can find a good cornetto is a must. Sadly in the USA they re VERY hard to find. But I got one here that was delicious and the employees were incredibly friendly. Semplicemente il miglior espresso a Dublino. Its simply the best espresso I found here in Dublin. Im really fussy about coffee, and this is the only place where I sit and order my espresso, confident that I will just enjoy it with a smile. Italian bar, very good panini and special espresso caffe. Early afternoon dj set with Ape Piaggio and Aperol Spritz. Great fried pizza. Friday night free buffet when you buy drinks. I love this place, coffee, food, pastries and their aperitivo on Friday are amazing! Definitely recommended. As an Italian abroad this is the place I go when I want to feel back home. Great espresso, bravi At the present time, cafes may only serve to customers who sit outside. This is one of the better places to do so in Dublin. There is quite a good amount of shelter from the elements, there is enough space to be comfortable, you are separated from people walking by and there is no traffic passing here. In addition, prices are reasonable. You can have a large americano and a pastry for less than  5. Frequented by lots of Italians so that has to say something. Coffee very good and the ambience of the place makes you feel like you are in a different country. Coffee and pastry deal is really good, the service is friendly and the place is cosy Great coffee, very cosy place, great service Very cozy place to eat. The owners are very friendly. Nice coffee and amazing hot chocolate. They just mess with the pastries a little bit. The staffs really nice and cool. Is a nice place to have a coffee with friends, outside to get some sun :D Lovely spot for a coffee. Good prices as well. The staff are always very friendly. I love the little terrace, very cosy. I come to this coffee shop every time Im around the area and the weather allows it. We always pay a visit to this small Italian Restaurant every time we go to Dublin. We love their coffee  and pastry. The staff are always  helpful and friendly. An Italian corner in the heart of Dublins centre. Relaxing; cozy and with a great staff. You may pop in for a cappuccino or a cup of coffee, treating yourself with delicious delicatessen, or having a real Italian spritz during weekends. I went there for aperitivo few times. Beside the fact quality is slowing decreasing (but still good), the real issue is that in less than one hour from opening there wont be any food, and drink will still be at full price (the one which include food). If aiming for an Italian aperitivo, I advise to be already there at 6pm (the time the aperitivo will open) or not to go at all, since youll just get stuck in a huge crowd of people, no sit, expensive drink, no food. Very cozy place, the pizza was great, and the staff were pleasant and prompt. And the free wifi was great for planning right after getting off a plane. The Italian barista were very warm, love the location of this place. The Cappuccino I had was good too. But for the price, quantity was less I think. I love this cafe but I was shocked by price hikes since my last visit some months ago -  9.30 for a regular tho v good cup of coffee + a small sandwich is pretty hefty! Authentic Italian coffee with pastry.  You can keep your Starbucks Sitting here now , I m a country man , up on the train , always our first stop , love it Nice coffee. Great team. Main seats are outside. Food A frequent customer for years plenty of friendly staff, food & pasteres & little cakes busy all the time a small place friendly and comfortable   A must for when your out and about in town Best coffee in Dublin, Good service the guys are amazing."
28,Caffe Nero,3.545,"It is a nice cafe. They should increase some vegetarian hot food options. Location is good and very convenient  . Staff was nice. Sometimes it can get really busy and order wait can be longer. They also have seats upstairs. Just got a coffee and the person who takes my order was so rude . She didn t make any effort to try to understand what I wanted, say  read there the menu   and she just dropped the coffee over the counter without even looking at me or say thank you etc . After that , my enjoyable time to have a coffee just vanished. I came for the first time to this place to try it out, but the red-haired girl treated me with racism. I don t know why she treated me like this and spoke to me in a way that no one could like and accused me. Unfortunately, a very bad experience. I ordered a cortado with oat milk here the other day and I m not sure if the barista who served me at least has been properly trained. The shot was 10 seconds, and only a single for 3.50 ? Seems very steep, even for Dublin , especially since he just poured the second shot out. The milk was also burnt and it just tasted horrendous. There was a long queue which was the only reason I didn t ask for it to be remade. The place itself looked cozy but slightly messy, lots of plates and cups left here and there. Also understaffed. Not enough people for the amount of work required there. One of my favourite places to go for coffee .. baristas provide professional services and theres  that Christmas wibe already .. love the tree with coffee cup boubles   and my favourite drink - americano over ice with coconut milk Nice coffee and very friendly staff. They get to know your order quickly if youre a regular Excellent coffee in the heart of Dublin. One of the very few places which serve fresh cream as an extra. 5 stars alone for this option. Have called in here a few times when in town. Croissants are good too. Recommended. very nice iced latte and the upstairs is a nice quiet place to study. theres also outlets you can use. Absolutely disgusting , watery, bitter and unreasonably expensive coffee, the worst Ive tried in Dublin.  I paid 10 euros for coffee and a small cake, and it was money thrown away.  Im serious, even McDonalds has better coffee than here. The atmosphere is a walk-through courtyard, it s uncomfortable to be on the first floor, and the second floor is crowded with people with laptops. I regretted going to this place for my lunch coffee. Such a good Chai latte. Great service and atmosphere. However, the only complaint i had was the glass wall view we had from our seats looking up stairs for 2nd floor seating, showed some gross spilt drink on the glass and down the wall, that looked like it never got cleaned.  Looked nasty. Great Nero in a very central location. Seating outside, inside and upstairs. Bookshelves!! Parking: No parking. Kid-friendliness: A bit narrow for children and buggies. I went to Caffe Nero at O Connell where I was too bad treated by the staff who was suppose to be the manager (a blond woman), she was extremely rude telling me they didn t have any seats, forcing me to decide quickly either if I wanted to have a coffee there or take away (when she has already told me there were no seats available) then she also refused to attend me, giving me the money back. I was fully upset and I also had already wasted my QR code from Three app which I didn t have a coffee!!! Such an unacceptable behaviour specially from a supposed manager! Very disappointing! Very rude staff member. We were getting served by a member of staff and asked if there were any seats upstairs as the place was a bit busy and we weren t sure so thought we d ask before we get it for takeaway as it s freezing outside nowadays. Then, another staff member, a blonde lady with tattoos butts into us questioning the staff member shouting  no there s no seats upstairs no  with an angry look on her face. Then there was a couple beside us trying to use a discount code that comes with Three+ and it wasn t working so the blonde lady was visibly annoyed and as the couple was leaving she started complaining to her co-worker  what a waste of two drinks . I was actually appalled at the service we got, we done a long day shopping around the city centre and came down to cafe nero for a coffee as a little treat as we love the quality of cafe nero s drinks and were surprised with the rudeness of the staff. The coffee itself was lovely that was prepared for us two by the other member of staff that looked embarrassed of her co-workers attitude. We won t be coming to this cafe nero again after our experience here. Nice place for a coffee and cakes. Thee are few table but being the shop on OConnell Street it can be very crowded. Toilets only for customers My god, what a cold welcome... The desire to work is not there, that s for sure. Coffee almost cold, dirty table with cocoa spilled everywhere from previous customers, floor full of cocoa and I had to ask 3 times before they came to clean, we had almost finished our breakfast.. for the prices they are a little high given the location Peace and calm morning vibe! Very tasty coffee! Many thanks The Frappe Creme has o taste at all, which was a disappointment but I belive they do very good drinks there. I was just unlucky. BAAAD SERVICE! AWFUL ATTITUDE!! We walked in to get a couple of coffees to go and a bite to eat. The place was a bit crowded as is usual in this type of coffee shops but we waited in line since there were only two baristas trying to handle all the customers at once. However in the little room next to the bar were two other employees just chilling and doing NOTHING! When asked if they could please take our order, one of the employees (a blonde girl) simply replied  but they are two baristas doing the orders  without knowing the back story to her attitude, I would simply say that if you have a place crowded with customers GET OUT THERE AND WORK! Help the two baristas already trying to multiply themselves to make all the orders as fast as possible!! I just bought hot chocolate and it was amazing service very very delicious regular hot chocolate and the service was so professional. I really appreciate and I device everyone go to this lady thank you so much. Good coffee and the staff are lovely, bad atmosphere particularly in the evening strange men around who looked through my bad when I wasnt looking, these men are regulars in the afternoon/evening I expected this to suck and be like an Irish Starbucks adjacent but it slapped I am just recently dipping my toes in the dirty chai waters so maybe I m not qualified to touch on this but I really had the best dirty chai here and the cwoffees are FAT don t play w them Food Loved the cafe. Visited three time during our stay in Dublin. Wonderful coffee, nice staff what else you can ask for When I was here, there were men having a fight in the cafe. Guards had to come and the men ended up boxing the heads off each other outside. Most of the customers seemed scared. The bathroom is locked, and staff need to leave the till/drinks area to unlock it, and this adds a lot of unnecessary time to the service. Most places have a code or just an open door. Vegetarian options: Lots of options Dietary restrictions: Some of the food have warnings that they might contain allergens Kid-friendliness: Not very kid friendly. Theres nothing for kids to do, and screaming kids disrupt other customers. Its also easy for kids to run onto the street, and theres a lot of sketchy people about Wheelchair accessibility: Reasonably wheelchair accessible, the bathroom is good for people with wheelchairs or prams Paying customer and they wouldn t let us use our bathroom when pride was on. According to ISB Special Restaurant Licence (Standards) Regulations 1988 if you serve food and drink you are required to offer bathroom services. Staff did what they were told by manager but this is a health issue (pregnant women/ women who need to change a tampon) and general human right. Bad form I only had a coffee here. It was a busy Sunday yet there was only one toilet for customers, crazy but it might be because it is in on OConnell Street, Dublin. No doubt crazy rents. I thought the place was  in need of a paint! Coffee tastes mid. The cupbit came in is dirty. The lighting is not great, so the dust and hairs on the coffee lid does not show up as much on the picture here. Costumer service from the bartisa that served me was not great. Toilets are not available for costumers. Would go to a different coffee shop around this area. Contrary to the Nero in Waterford city, this is the way it should be done. Proper coffee, sharp and attentive service. No messing. Excellent coffee and people tuned in to what is happening around them. Excellent. Is a cozy coffee atmosphere, but the staff doesnt know how many people they could  fit comfortably....    Is way too occupied and noisy Nice and cosy cafe on the town. Very comfy sitting area with great music. Lovely coffe too. Big plus for the clubcard on the phone and possibility to order coffe online for those on Rush and on the go all the time, just order and collect inside , there are some other good rewards as well. Recommended I have visited this branch of Caffe Nero a few time this year. While I enjoy the drinks I ordered, the service from the staff is good and its a nice place to visit, what puts me off is the cleanliness of the shop. I cannot believe it is allowed to open as an eating establishment. While the tables are relatively clean and wiped down, all the surrounding walls and especially going up the stairs really look grim and disgusting. They dont seem to do any deep cleans at all here. It cannot be lack of money as this place is constantly busy. It is a shame to not seem to give a damn about it. What are the owners doing about it? I also visited a branch in Blackrock to visit a friend and this shop was tip top, as expected, spotless everywhere. Since numerous people have commented here about the cleanliness and nothing seems to be done about it, I am going to check with the food authority body to call in anonymously to see if it is acceptable. I would be especially worried if there was a back area, e.g. storage and what condition that was in. UPDATE: Have reported above to the FSAI (Food Safety Authority of Ireland) to try to get something done about it and they are dealing with it now. Slow service but a pleasant girl. Toilets are a disgrace,  and the floor looks like its never been washed. I was here at midday and it was quiet, so no excuses for it not to be in good condition . Also I find it  appalling that only card payments can be used. I would not have ordered here if I knew that. Great place to have a cup of coffee and read a book. Might feel a bit crowded at times but its all worth it. Look I usually love cafe Nero. Always find the staff friendly. However the presentation of my drink today was ridiculous. If you ignore the little spill on the left that was a result of me stirring the cup because it was overflowing the server placed my chai tea latte directly on this tray on no saucers even though there were a million saucers right beside he trays. And as he put it down the whole spill that you can see on the right happened and he made no comment whatsoever and just asked me to pay. Not my best experience in a cafe Nero. Side note though their chai latte in general is usually very good and the taste was not affected by my experience coz it still tasted really good. A great location, next to the spire in the heart of dublin city center. Friendly staff and good service. Coffee smells like cabinets, Are you serious? You know what tastes terrible? Arrived here for take away cake. Good service, very helpful.  Will be back. What a shame. Coffee and music were nice but staff were extremely rude. Came here for a coffee with my husband and baby at 7am, purposefully found a corner upstairs where we wouldn t bother anyone. My son was playing on the ground quietly and an employee came over and aggressively told us to pick up his toy from the floor (not in anybody s way) and that we were only allowed to use one table. Bad vibes. Won t be back. Kid-friendliness: Not kid friendly at all. Closest place to my hotel, figured Why not? Chai latte tastes like water; Im not getting any tea or spice taste at all which is amazing considering of even has a cinnamon dusting. Lemon cake is light and pleasant enough but a bit too dry/crumbly and I expect lemon to have a bit more bite to it. Staff were great and professional. Ambiance is chill enough. WiFi required setting up an account, eff that. Its the last time we come here. The bathroom is unpresentable, dirty, what a shame. I recently visited Caffe Nero on OConnell Street and, unfortunately, my experience was far from ideal. Its evident that the place is in dire need of refurbishment and better management. The sofas were worn out, and the overall cleanliness left much to be desired. The food and drinks did not meet my expectations either. The pastries were quite dry, making it difficult to finish them, and the coffee had a burnt taste. Considering the price point, I expected a higher quality product. However, I must acknowledge the efforts of the staff, who were friendly and tried their best to accommodate guests in a fast-paced environment. They deserve recognition for their hard work despite the less-than-ideal conditions. Caffe Nero on OConnell Street is situated in a prime tourist area, and its essential to present a better image to visitors. With some renovations, improved management, and attention to detail, the cafe has the potential to become a delightful spot for tourists and locals alike. Im giving it 2 stars, primarily due to the commendable efforts of the staff. I hope to see improvements made in the future, as the cafe has potential if the necessary changes are implemented. They start close almost 2 hr before the close time. They putted my dessert inside a paper bag, the cream got stoke in the paper. They closed downstairs as well and you dont have place to get sit and enjoy your coffee. If you are going nearly closing hours its the worst place to get a coffee! Quiet place can have a relax time by own self or with friends. Service is nice and lots of choices to eat. With art design deco interior. I ordered a cappuccino and it was cold so I brought it back. They gave me another one and it was like pouring water directly from the kettle into my mouth! It cost  4. Ridiculous! The coffee and food is very good, we have returned multiple times even though the dark haired women working are not friendly at all. They do not greet you, not a single smile, very brut and harsh when speaking to you. Requests aren t followed very well either, asked for no cream on top and yet got cream, asked to sit in and got take away cups instead. If the coffee and food wasn t good we wouldn t come back. Very relaxing atmosphere, plenty of room inside ground floor and downstairs, also outside seating area. Staff are barista trained which is a very good sign of the ownership. Lots of activity in the place, looks to be used a lot by people using laptop computers either for leisure or work. No soap in bathroom, only sanitizer. Sanitizer not a replacement. Its not effective against noro virus and some other viruses. Otherwise hreat place! Our very first coffee in Dublin. And pistachio cake was amazing. The staff here are extremely rude. Male barista is an ignorant so and so. Didnt say thanks or anything. He was the same with the woman in front of me. He needs a lesson in good customer service. I wont be coming back here again. Quite a choice, my oat milk coffee was very good. However, the staff were not friendly and the place was not clean, especially the toilets.... Part of a large European coffee chain, but feels like an independent coffee house. Large, cozy atmosphere with comfy couches, bookshelves filled with old books and vintage decor. Good place to rest your feet, catch up with a friend, read, or work on a laptop. The basement is quieter and less busy and has a large table with outlets nearby so you can charge devices. Nice selection of hot and cold drinks, as well as sandwiches and treats. quiet, cozy atmosphere just across from stephen s green. no parking available on the street, wheelchair accessible entrance. average cafe pricing Dietary restrictions: they serve regular milk substitutes like oat, almond etc. Honestly, can you really get it that wrong. Large made as small. 3 times, yes 3 times confirmed the order as dry cappuccino and what gets made? Not dry. Its really not that difficult to give the customer what they want. Listen and get it right, or go get another job. Food Great decor, very chilled atmosphere, plenty of space both upstairs and downstairs. Great coffee. Food 20 meters far from St. stephen s green shopping center lovely cafe with really nice decoration and good quality of coffee... the staff is really friendly as well... perfect if you want a quite and comfortable place... One of my go-to cafes around Grafton Street. The coffee and the croissant are delicious . The decor has many dark academia elements, very cozy interior. Never had any problems or complaints, the staff are very lovely. Overall a really nice cafe that is worth visiting if you re in the area. Its super cold here...really no explanation why they make here this cold... And its Ireland... Like why would you turn on the air-conditioner when its 15C outside... Very expensive and taste is not the best. All people drink tea or coffee is that the reason the improvement doesnt exist in all kinds of coffees. Toilets were very dirty and very crowded at that time.. Food The four stars is just because it is convenient to buy from the cafe as it is nearby. However, it is you and your luck whether you will get fast service or not and someone who smiles or frowns all the time. It is fine as I suspect they arent well paid Outstanding and dependable coffee purveyors! I have stopped in many times and locations and been pleased every time! Comfortable digs too. Sweet location on walk street central to Dublin. Very good. Friendly staff and good coffee. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the food and coffee was nice the day my family went in. Able to get vegan porridge and vegan coffee. Nicely newly decorated but only bad thing was the shop and toilets were not very clean. Vegetarian options: Vegan options available. Wheelchair accessibility: Some wheelchair accessible seating area and wheelchair accessible toilet. It opens until 9, that s nice. So many otherplaces close too early Food I love Cafe Nero, first it serves great coffee, nice blends and types so it is a coffee house first. Ambience is similar in them all, relaxed, laid back and comfy. Everything about Cafe Nero is laid back, staff are knowledgable and always friendly. Waited for coffee more then 15 minutes and only one guy working all the time, two girls were slow and chatting all the time. When mentioned that it takes too long and that the que is getting longer, the girl with the black hair was really rude and said to relax. Awful experience  never going back again. Good place to be in in Dublin since this Italian chain cafe was influenced all over the world AMAZING! Very warm and calm. Has very comfortably couches and calming illumination. The coffee has high quality and its very tasty. Great coffee, but the place reeks. Dirty tables inside and outside. Cigarettes, napkins, and general dirt everywhere. Lazy management. The light shades on the left Side of the cafe. Are to low I have hit my head off Them a number of times. They need To be shortened.  The tables are very Rearly cleared you have to clear Them yourself. Very handy coffee shop since its open so late, making it good for hanging out in town without needing a pub. Seating is decent and the same as youd find in any other Nero so no complaints there The coffee here can be quite bitter Incredible vibe and friendly employees, hot chocolate was also grand. Ive never been to such a filthy coffee shop. Im not one for such a bad review but this is necessary and I do apologise to the owner. Toilets - dirty stained floors, very smelly, no soap. Huge roll of tissue that I had to pick up off the back of the toilet and unroll. Period blood stains all over the sanitary bin. Shop - filty! , sticky dirty floor all the way through. Dirty tables we had to move used cups off our table onto another. The dust was very thick on the book shelve and books (gross). The armchairs and sofas are absolutely disgusting omg Ive never seen such bad condition furniture in a coffee shop. Ye maybe your tryna go for the friends look but these are bad. Staff - unhelpful, very slow, girl rolled her eyes at me when I said I was sitting in, i got ignored when I asked how are you and got no thanks. I will not be back here unless management focused on what a business should be. Also the fruits flies and blue bottles flying around was a huge no no for me. Its like an infestation. Shows a sign of the conditions in there. Also at the disabled toilets there was 2 or 3 big black bags of rubbish blocking the door. Wheelchair accessibility: Yes there is easy access in and disabled toilets Very good coffee choices Always a good atmosphere and beautiful decoration Beautiful interior with pretty decorations. Warm and cosy so you can sit down and enjoy a drink during cold weather. The coffee is delicious and very high quality. I ordered an iced Americano with a squirt of vanilla syrup (extra syrup is free). The atmosphere is warm, comforting and had a very New York coffee shop feel. The staff are patient and friendly. The location is fantastic, very close to St Stephens green, so you can grab a drink and sit down to appreciate the parks fantastic nature. Reasonable prices. Overall, a very nice coffee shop hidden between the busy streets of Dublin city. Dietary restrictions: Variety of options for dairy free drinks. Lovely coffee shop. I was here with my partner on vacation and never go to the big chains when I travel. This us the coffee shop you want the bigs to be. Great service, great coffee, and get you on your way. Rocket fuel in hand. Dietary restrictions: Seem excellent at catering to your dietary needs. I think they can adapt anything and have food items for everyone. Caffe Nero has been our go to coffee joint in Europe for some time. Tucked into 17th and 18th century buildings, they never disappoint for atmosphere or quality. My favorite is the oat milk cortado or the flat white. There are so many charming, high quality coffee shops everywhere, but this is always a good go-to and is usually open earlier than other shops. Asked for an iced cappuccino and the trainee made it. It was just a cup of foam with a shot of espresso at the bottom, I know trainees are new so I politely asked the non trainee if she could remake it as this was clearly not a cappuccino. She then proceeded to try and gaslight me into thinking that was how cafe Nero made their cappuccinos and rolled her eyes at me while whispering with other staff members and sniggering. I was a barista for 3 years and I know what a cappuccino looks like. Every time she d walk past my table she d roll her eyes. Just so strange because I was very polite and understanding that trainees make mistakes. Never recommending this place to anyone Any one think that Starbucks the best coffee, aroma, service, value for money ....think again and try Nero. Came in for a coffee this evening, red haired person seemed to be the only one working but was so lovely despite it looking to be a stressful time with lots of customers. Coffee was also one of the best I ve gotten in a while. Got a nice seat in the downstairs area - really cool vibe there. Nice but cold as air-condition was blowing terribly. Coffee is fabulous but the mugs were chipped. Staff abrupt, no pouring cream or Almond milk on offer. Couldnt tell up how much a KEEP CUP was that we wanted to buy.   very disappointed as love. Love the coffee. I m a Dub & meet family & friends in  this Cafe Nero weekly.  THE STAFF is brilliant consistently   - lovely atmosphere & great location! If you have arrived on an early flight and your room is not ready. - Cafe Nero in Temple Bar is the place to go Sit on the benches outside and watch the world go by PS: The staff is brilliant We needed a quick pick-me-up after a full day of tours and before more tours. The coffee is perfectly made and balanced. My wife and I had cherry lattes and my daughter enjoyed a hot chocolate, which were all delicious. The staff were very helpful and accommodating in their suggestions. The prices are fairly reasonable. The entire place is small but they try to pack in the seating as much as possible. It seems like a nice place to work if you can get a seat. It s especially nice for working, journaling, or just sitting and thinking as the entire aesthetics of the place is that of a darkly lit and warmly inviting cafe. Overall, it s a great place for a quick stop or a long working afternoon. Enjoy. One of the few coffee spots open before 8:00AM, and I m glad we stopped in because it was a delicious cup of coffee and some great muffins. Exceeded my expectations for a chain coffee shop. It was VERY quiet, but the staff there was very friendly. Spacious, but still a nice cozy spot for a cup of coffee and discussion. Sometimes that all you really need of a place. It was a great atmosphere with the jazzy music. The luxury chocolate was so smooth and rich in flavor. The seating area upstairs was really homey and lovely. The cookies and cinnamon rolls are great too. Very delicious. The cinnamon roll was fluffy and loaded with flavor. The cookie was rather soft baked and also tasty. Staff is always lovely, welcoming, and super kind. All of them remember my usual order and it s easy to strike up a conversation, banter a little. Best Oat Flat White in town. Yep, probably biased because I like it so much, but honestly, good coffee, a great barista, and a chill atmosphere are the best mix. Also a good place for writing and studying. Or meeting friends. Big shoutout to the staff for always being respectful and kind. I wanted to share some feedback about my recent visit. Unfortunately, I had a really unpleasant experience with one of your staff members. They were disrespectful and asked me to leave in a rude manner I was shocked and it was first time someone talk to me like this. It left me feeling unwelcome and upset. I believe in treating everyone with respect and valuing their contributions, so this was really disappointing and discriminating about how you look. I hope you can address this issue and ensure a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all customers. 26/04/2024 Thanks, 15:35pm The staff there is so warm and welcoming! The ambient is nice too, I like to spend some time there just observing while drinking my coffee Place was good and tidy, but lacked enthusiasm. The staff were only friendly to a certain point. Toilet was clean, but they always keep it locked and hand the keys to you when you need to use it. I wasn t very fond of where the toilet was located. I understand that a bathroom has to be private and out the way, but it felt secluded from the rest of the shop. I have to let a BIG THANK and all my compliments to the staff Sean for his professionalism and kindness!!! I came straight from other Caffe Nero at O Connell where I was too bad treated and also kicked off by the staff who was suppose to be the manager, she was extremely rude telling me they didn t have any seats, forcing me to decide quickly either if I wanted to have a coffee there or take away (when she has already told me there were no seats available) then she also refused to attend me, giving me the money back. I was fully upset and I also had already wasted my QR code from Three app which I didn t have a coffee. So I explain to him the whole situation just willing to use my QR code wasted in that situation earlier so he gave me a coffee and also apologised for her behaviour! We went around 6pm to have some chocolate, there were some dirty tables. Only the upper bathroom was open and it was dirty. The chocolate with whipped cream was tasty. Nice place in the heart of temple bar. Not so much space and might be crowded. Staff is super helpful,nice,friendly. Toilet code downstairs is 135. Asked to buy hot water,they didnt charge me. Thanks for that,very appreciated. Coffee,tea,sandwitches,cakes A wonderful little coffee shop in the heart of Temple Bar. It s a great place to sit and have a coffee and a pastry while people-watching through the window. The employees were very pleasant, too! Cozy and enjoyable place. Perfect for taking a break siping a good coffee, chatting or working. Intresting variety of coffee tastes and lovely baked food available. Friendly and helpful staff. Great! Top Cappuccino we discovered this lovely place. Great cafe friendly their cappuccino is very recommended. Nice atmosphere Ok, I didnt have hi expectations from Cafe Nero, but this branch is worse than the average cafe Nero youve seen. Waitresses are loud and rude, focused on their phones rather than costumes. The toilets are out of order,  the place is messy and untidy. This is the view from my table! Zero vibe! NEEDS ATTENTION. The individual making the coffee, etc was nice and efficient--she made a great cappuccino. But the restaurant itself was not very clean, including the tables and the bathroom, in particular, which was pretty disgusting. Thats a big turn off to me and you wont find me back here. i ordered a coffee after five minutes of waiting until staff stopped talking to each other, there was a queue behind me. my coffee was totally over drawn and burnt and smelled awful, workers directly ignored me when i tried to gain their attention to continue behaving in an unprofessional way, talking loudly about drugs and drink behind the till and openly ignoring customers. i should like to see these people removed from the shop as i expect to be served coffee and heard when it is burnt and i do not need to know the personal workings of staff pr have to wait for them to finish their personal conversation, place needs new staff properly trained baristas Nice cafe, the minions they let work here do an excellent job, try oatmilk if youre having a sweet coffee. I once thought to myself ew how do you milk an oat but Nero in Temple Bar has convinced me Last week on Thursday, my wife and I stopped by to have a coffee and wait for a friend. We both had the same Mocha drink. My wife started feeling sick first by vomiting. I started feeling sick in the early hours of Friday. we both had a lot of vomiting and diarrhea. We lost a day of work. And now we are very afraid to drink any drink with milk outside the house I love Cafe Nero but I paid 6 euros for a coffee and a croissant and the toilet was awful, it should be renovated. Just went there 08/03/24 at 8:55 and there was only one worker ( a girl with black hair) smoking outside, I tried to go inside and she stoped me saying they weren t open. I asked when they would open and she just answered  I don t know Terrible staff, not time accurate in google. Food Nice place.  I like their coffee and the sausage roll. Great service. Good coffee. Nice spot to sit and enjoy the morning latte. Coffee there is good and i like the teas, its quite popular so can be hard to find a place to sit but nice ans comfy place with good staff I have my coffee there at least once in a week because of the three+ program. The coffee is nice but not the best, the staff are usually friendly and I liked the prices Food Great cafe! Ive been there so many times and every time feels special chai latte was 5 very good service.. clean.. chill ambience.. Food : 5/5 | Great place to stop. Get a croissant and a coffee.  Even iced coffee! I ordered a tgtg bag from here a few months ago. The pick up time was like 4-6pm or something so I arrived at the earliest time available. The staff there advised that I come back in an hour or so because they hadn t prepped the bags, and cancelled my order as soon as I left the shop. Dont know if I like this place or not. Its called cafe, but the coffee they do tasts horrible. They have sandwiches with wrong labels on the counter. Bought it anyway and it tasted very good. Maybe a place for a sandwich and a regular drink. Avoid the coffee A chain coffee shop with decent coffee and good pastries. It is not the cosiest place around, but offers nice views of one of the most popular streets in Dublin. Food Friendly welcome, warm and comfortable place Good products Seen on a busy street and seen on a pub with a very beautiful facade. Happened to be meeting a friend there and forgot that it was that pride thing was on, so I was dreading Temple Bar in general as the march would have been finished and the crowds horrendous, which they were, however to my delight and surprise Caffe Nero was light on clientele, private, quiet (must have triple glazing or something), service was great, plenty of plug sockets around and the   cappuccino for me was really nice, staff very personable, prices what youd pay in a Costa in a Spar, so for Temple Bar Well done guys, no problem recommending at all I didnt eat there, hence I left it blank Weve been there twice for St Patricks day and the queue was long. Staff managed to serve us all quickly and they were really nice with me. I couldnt speak that day and I use the note of my phone to ask for my order. When I came back later for a snack, the barista remembered my order, so as I didnt force my voice and this is an excellent customer service for me. Thanks a lot. Products are good and the coffee too, as always, CN is my favourite shop. Caffe Nero in Temple Bar is a wonderful Cafe. The building is beautifully situated in the heart of Temple Bar adjacent to Oliver St John Gogarthy and opposite the The Auld Dubliner. Its coffee heaven, the ambience and atmosphere makes for a terrific cup of coffee. Me and the lads had a great time here, the tea was superb and the cheese and tomato toasted sandwich was amazing. great atmosphere, coffee and carrot cake! I waited for the bus to gallway in the morning and it was a nice place. The environment and the atmosphere was great. Coffee is so so. Friendly staff. Nice cappuccino and desserts. Good atmosphere Both the atmosphere and the service were great. Hats off to their Italian barista for preparing the best cappuccino Ive had so far in Ireland, and sorry for ordering a cappuccino at 5 pm. I know its almost a criminal offense in your country. They have a lovely sitting area inside with a nice decoration. Went to Cafe Nero Dawson Street yesterday. My first time ever. Served by Valerion. . He said  7.65. Handed him  10. He said I can t take that it s old and shabby. I said there is nothing wrong with my money it s legal tender. He refused to take it so I got a  20 out of my purse and paid for the drinks. I am absolutely appalled at his rudeness and arrogance. People were listening and were appalled by his attitude. Will make this public to tell people don t use a crinkled nite in Cafe Nero. Short mid-morning coffee break. Small cozy place perfect for this stopover. Nero staff are wonderful, the most friendly and genuine staff. This is what makes a good cafe, as well as great coffee! The ambience is super important when you walk into a cafe, good seating, relaxed atmosphere and great staff! apparently a traditional caffe nero but we were Quite surprised in finding out just behind the entrance this cosy and warm space ( see the pics). The coffee is in the average like the other brands of this category but probably you will enjoy more because the place. Super nice! It is a lovely place with a good location and excellent coffee, but the internet connection is terrible. My family and I visited from the US and Valerio and Giuliano in particular far exceeded servicing expectations. Cappuccinos were equal or even better than those we have tasted throughout our vast travels of Italy even. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend. Cozy place, especially on the back seating area. The staff was professional and asked about COVID pass, that made me feel safer. Coffee was good, I didn t try cookies though. I regret to convey that the cappuccino experienced at your establishment was notably bitter, prompting me to seek an alternative venue. It is my sincere suggestion that the quality of your coffee aligns more consistently with the pricing standards set forth. Arrived here and ordered 2 drinks. I tried to use a voucher on my three mobile phone app (gives any drink for  1). Once scanned the server said that it was out of date, therefore I paid full price for both drinks. Once I sat down and checked the app the date was valid and expired the day after. No point going back to server! Once we had our drinks we had to wait for a seat as it was a hub for people on laptops and devices using the free WiFi. Some tables just had bags and devices and the occupants had disappeared.  Some tables didnt even have food and/or drinks and were obviously here for the day. We eventually got a seat. This place is OK for a take away but good luck getting a seat on a Saturday with people spending considerable time taking a table. Cafe from a chain that can be found almost everywhere. The decor is nice, sofas, club armchairs. Good pastries or pastries and different types of coffee for breakfast or a coffee break. Friendly and smiling staff. Very sullen waiting staff. No words spoken. Had to ask for serviette. Loos dirty and no toilet paper. On the upside the coffee was really good Good location. Staff are very friendly as soon as you get to the counter. Plenty of seats. If you go past the counter and turn left , there are more comfortable seats/ couches and a lit fire, books on shelves,  where you can chill and get away from the busy streets outside for a wee while Beautiful coffees and warm welcome from Valero (hes just two weeks in Ireland and is doing a wonderful job here in cafe Nero Dawson st) I also want to mention Roun very nice and so hardworking...I have to say all the  staff here are lovely and so are the coffees wether its a flat white, mocha or cappuccino they are all made really well and taste gorgeous..thank you guys! Nice Cafe, with large seating area with library. The show case Can be improved ,and  the coffee more professiol. Food The girl at the till was not nice, the card machine wasn t working, the iced cappuccino is like 90% milk, there were little flies everywhere, they had no cups for sitting in so we had to have takeaway cups and the couches were covered in crumbs. Was overcharged for my coffee and pastry and when I went back up to the till to say it to the staff, one of the women were incredibly dismissive and rude and said  bye  to my face, refusing to refund me. It turns out it was a miscommunication on their part regarding what I had ordered but once they discovered their mistake and refunded me I didn t even get so much as an apology. Customer service really lacking. Just all around great coffee. Its got a wonderful old feel to it. Tons of seating, a bunch of different kinds of options. And the coffee is just fantastic! Lovely coffee shop with plenty of seating and perfect for a place to sit. The staff here are amazing. Decent coffee for reasonable prices and loyalty cards are also offered. Food Very cozy place with warm atmosphere. Kind staff. Tea and coffee were tasty. Very good table is near stove   . Enjoy and a Happy New Year Food : 5/5 | A bit overpriced for such average and artificially-tasting food, ATM machine was not working. It is well decorated but could be way cleaner, specially in the bathrooms. Really tasty baked goods and delicious tea. The interior is nicely decorated and has lots and lots of space. But that is all for the positive sides. The service was basically non-existent. No greeting or in any way noticing customers upon entering. Poor communication. No plates, no mugs, only papercups and paper pockets. Napkins were basically sandpaper. The restroom was out of order, and so many things just seemed to be somehow incomplete. The ceiling looks terrible and cuts away the nice and warm mood of the place. Conclusion: a really good place to pick up a takeaway cup & cake, but at least I will not visit again. Comfortable environment, baristas are suler nice, coffee is always good, great background music; highly recommended. Great service from Valerio Best Cafe Nero I been to.  Staff is really friendly and helpful! Coffee could be a little bit better (coffee latte was too much coffee) but the paninis and croissants were really good. Sadly the cappucino cake was a lil dry. The coffee is good A little expensive But staff spend more time laughing and watching videos with each other on their smartphones than taking care of customers. The tables are not cleared or even cleaned. To avoid Place is filthy, there was plenty of staff and it wasnt busy at all yet it was impossible to find a clean space. Toilet didnt work too, avoid. Shame because if the space was well taken care of the coffee shop would be lovely. Whilst I usually really enjoy the coffee from this franchise, the only male barista here is extremely rude. He has put me off ever returning and I would advise avoiding this particular store or even franchise because of his awful demeanor and lack of ability. Cosy little cafe. Had a delicious cappuccino to go. I can t speak on the food here, but their iced pistachio latte was the BEST latte I ve ever had!!! Juan, the guy who served us was very friendly and gave us very good recommendations, the vegan croissant and the mango and passion fruit juice were a success. Vegetarian options: The vegan Croissant is amazing Great place to grab a coffee and a quick brownie. Lovely place with very comfy seats. Nice and classic cafe shop, #Espresso there is so good I dont recommend this place. It looks cozy from the outside but inside is dirty. The armchairs smell like vomit. The tables are dirty and sticky. When I put my phone on my table I had to use wet wipe to clean it because there was sugar and salt sticked to it. I came for the breakfast and staff was loud. The only thing I enjoyed was coffee. Its OK but today they had run out of Oat and Almond milk, so I ended up on regular milk. Cake was ok 4.75 is a disgusting price for a large latte Shame on you Excellent customers service, chocolate vegan cheese cake delicious and the restaurant very clean. Love it Hot chocolate was nice, they ran out of proper cups and served the chai tea in paper cups. Cookie was decent. Service was rather poor unfortunately and they only accept cash, because their internet was down. The morning staff today was absolutely awful. Not even they were not wearing masks they were very rude and unprofessional. No hospitality skills at all, and they seemed bored and uninterested. I love Nero cafe shop, I often chose the franchise than other ones, its a shame the staff was so unwelcoming. Great coffee , nice sandwiches, expensive for what I got in my opinion.  Staff pleasant but  one trainee barista and one staff is not enough for a 1.15 lunch time session.  Suggestion go there if you have time though not on a lunchtime run. Good coffee if you re in a hurry. It s a chain shop with some bakery items. They did add chocolate on top (my partner loved that about her trip to Oxford). No gluten-free options, but it does have a toilet for customers. Fastatic coffee every time. Good croissants very fresh. Plenty of space to relax and even do some work. Nice place. Good atmosphere. I ordered a scone which I suspect wasn t today s. Also I had to pay  1 for jam and 50 cent for butter!!!! The coffee is good and not overpriced as in other shops. Additionally, I like this shop very much, as they offer some cozy private benches spots like you see in the attacched picture. Best coffee and perfect fluffy bakery. Amazing tasty and friendly personal. A nero cafe run by a friendly young man. Errors in the order but a good atmosphere. Perfect Caffe to go into and just read a book or learn something for school. The drinks are very good and atmosphere is good too! I can just recommend it! I love all the cafe Neros Ive been to so far, this place is small and in the heart of Dublin, a relaxed atmosphere in a busy city. small Nero that I passed by on my way to Trinity College, had a lovely hot chocolate with coconut milk made by William, whos very cute by the way Excellent coffee and friendly service. William was very helpful An espresso in a tall cup? I have never seen such incompetence in a Nero. Also the service was unbelievably slow at a time in which I was in high rush. Nice coffee shop that offers decent coffee and snacks for a midday pick-me-up! Great coffee spot especially for cappuccino. I usually love Nero, but this one is not good. Bad service. Update 01.05.2022.: Got here at 17:48 to collect my order, but they are closed even though they are supposed to be working til 18:00. Extremely unprofessional! Thank you to the staff at Caffe Nero, Merrion Row for the excellent customer service experience I had this afternoon. I needed to get vouchers for work and the staff were unbelievably helpful in getting me sorted with a quick turnaround. If you are popping around Dublin City centre looking for a place with lovely coffee, amazing staff and good vibes definitely head to Merrion Row! Thank you again for all your help, looking forward to returning soon. I walked into this cafe as I do everyday, it s where I go to get my boost of energy that I need to continue my day after 4pm, I walk into this cafe and there was one girl alone there serving customers with a line of ten people waiting. Disgraceful, definitely need someone behind the bar, didn t help that I saw a woman with red hair in a Nero shirt writing an essay at a table, not even helping with the situation at hand, I waited here for 30 minutes until I got served with the red haired woman never glancing an eye at the situation. After I got served I sat down to do my work and the woman with red hair didn t move from the spot for another 2 HOURS, shocking to see in an establishment like this. I definitely will not be returning to buy another coffee, although the people who served me were kind and polite at the time, disgraceful line and the woman with red hair could put a bit more effort into making sure the shop was working the way it should. Disgraceful wait and experience. Just wanted to say that the staff member I dealt with last Sunday was so kind, helpful, generous. I think his name is Francis and he really was so warm and welcoming. Thank you ! I was here today and really underwhelmed. I was the only guest and there were 2 staff members. Still it took a lot of time to do everything. They are super passiv and inattentive. The coffee tasted so burned and is just trash. Really the worst coffee I had for a long time. I dont know what other peoples standards of hygiene are, but I was surprised to read some of the reviews describing this cafe as clean. Its far from it. each time Ive been there, the toilets have been disgusting. I was afraid to touch anything, even felt i needed to wash my hands again on exiting. Such a shame...its ideally located, the coffee is good and its nice to sit and watch the footfall. That is, if you can ignore the unwashed windows, the dirty skirting boards and manky chairs! Come on management, make this into a cafe we can be proud of in Dublin...so many tourists walking past from Stephens Green etc. This Nero is consistently disappointing, always understaffed, always given a paper cup while sitting in instead of a mug, tables are always dirty. I love Nero coffee generally but I dont bother visiting this store anymore Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Good coffee and the cafe is spacious, a nice space to relax. Nice coffee, relaxed atmosphere, good service Grand coffee. I was in this particular caffe Nero twice in recent weeks to get some work done on my laptop. Both times I was taken aback by the staff. For the majority of the time I was there, the workers were sat at a customer table loudly messing around and chatting to each other. I had to ask for my dirty table to be cleaned before sitting. They were so unprofessional. Not once did I see any of them move around to check the tables. I couldnt believe my ears when one of them started to loudly read out the cafes bad google reviews and then laugh abnoxiously. This review is for her. Very obvious there is no management around to keep this rude staff in check. Very great service!!  (And a very cute barista tho) Coffee and bottle of water consumed sitting on dirty chairs or benches and tables too. The beautiful benches cannot be used because there are chairs on them. Sticky door handles, unfrequentable toilets, broken flush, no soap.... Not for me. The staff make it seem like your coffee order and presence is an inconvenience. Youll get a much better service (and at least a smile) from those in the Spar next door. The staff are clearly not happy in here and that explains the high turnover in there. Very good cafe, very cozy to just read a book or do something, had no too-loud customers (of course that depends on the customers, but still). Barista wasnt the nicest person, had some attitude, but didnt have any problems. Good coffee and cakes.  Busy around lunchtimes and 11s but comfortable outside the rush hours.  Some big tables if in a group  but small ones for a chat aswell. Priced as you expect in Dublin. Good cappuccino and rich salted caramel brownie. Interesting literary-themed decor, quite fitting for this area of Dublin. Toilet for the disabled at back of cafe. Easy to access. I only stayed for 1 minute, as I wanted an Irish coffee but they didnt do alcohol, si we had to go somewhere else. Nice place,good location, nice staff. Perfect yo grab a coffee on the go or to sit and relax for a while. It gets busy at times. Great coffee The lovely girl serving us was great but she was on her own while the bar was very busy. Cafe Nero should be ashamed to treat employees is such a disgraceful way. Never again! Flat white and panini - panini was actually soft like they should be, unlike some places. Flat white was good too. Staff were friendly and a relaxed atmosphere The shelves were very dusty and the offer was not great. 3pm and they didnt havr any kind of sweets, cakes to havr a coffee I dropped in for a coffee at lunchtime and was told that they would only serve it in a takeaway cup. I asked for it in a conventional cup but was told that they were only serving takeaway cups. I asked if an exception could be made (I explained that I have Parkinsons disease and that I had a difficulty with takeaway cups in that my hand shakes and this can result in my being scalded). The guy behind the counter merely parroted off what he had already told me. I made my excuses and left! Lovely coffee, nice decor and friendly/helpful staff. Expensive food however and average priced coffe for a high end coffee shop. Central location just off Stephens green helps the rating. The food selection wasnt extensive however this visit was during the bad weather and Im sure supplies were limited. I was in this cafe today i bought a coffee and something to eat to take away, when i was leaving i noticed it was raining outside so i sat down to eat my food for 5 minutes and a member of staff by the name of kelly asked to see my proof of vaccination when i told her i wasnt vaccinated she told me i couldnt eat in their premises i had to leave, ive never come across someone so rude, it was the way she spoke to me it was disgraceful, i will be making a formal complaint, it wasnt what she said it was how she said it, shame on her. Nice place. I like especially the comfortable seats in front of the big window on the street . If you come here for the late afternoon you can enjoy a quite and relaxing atmosphere and during my visit I was lucky enough to get some sunshine ! Delicious coffee & cakes. A really good treat after a busy day down town. Lovely surroundings and staff exceptionally polite. Such a lovely place. I really love to work in this Caffe Nero when there is no lockdown or smth. All staff is so cool but Cam definitely is the best."
29,Cathedral Cafe,4.225,"Food: The cappuccino glass is a bit old you can see from the handle that its color is off already, the foam was not set and fluffy but just small bubbles and runny. The tuna melt was a great choice of bread and the perfect cheese hasnt had a good combination of string strength and stretch on a melted sub in a long while the only downside was the lettuce was ruined it was too moist in the melt you never warm lettuce its a kitchen rule everywhere and everyone knows that. Would replace a lettuce with a different ingredients to make that perfect tuna melt they have a huge potential with that choice of bread and cheese. As for the carrot cake the extra-sided yogurt was a bit too much for decoration and didnt add much flavor, sometime simple is better. The cake by itself tastes wonderful no need to add anything! Service : Took a bit longer to serve but its just because thats only one person on the whole place not sure if its usually the case or low on staff for the day but if thats one person on the entire coverage its a bit too much to handle, I admire the idea for independence but busy days on like this or even on less sunny days it should be taken as a consideration, not to overwhelm yourself. Atmosphere : An old-style coffee place that has a cool and cozy feeling. Kinda makes you feel like youre entering a home and not a coffee shop. Which its a unique style. Small but lovely. The place is fantastic and the food is delicious. I recommend it, especially if youre not in a hurry and enjoy well made food. Great place, very cozy and welcoming. The prices are affordable (14/15  for a complete meal, with a drink and a dessert) Delicious food! Great option for breakfast or brunch. We had an  irish breakfast  - toast, 2 sausages, egg, amazing beans in tomato sauce and bacon. So tasty! For drink you can choose from many types of coffees and other beverages. Too bad we were too full to try some of their tasty looking pastries. Food Do not miss the best food and best view of St Patricks Cathedral. Breakfast and brunch, homemade patries and good coffee. The food is cooked on the spot by the owner: an amazing Spanish lady that makes the place bubbly and welcoming. The staff is really friendly, efficient and the atmosphere unbeatable. Lots of regular and workers freque tly stop for brunch which means a lot. Thanks, guys! Wheelchair accessibility: There was a customer using a wheelchair when I was there. A simple safe with yummy food.  We stumbled on this unpretentious cafe when going to St Patrick s and greatly enjoyed the green breakfast and coffee.  Don t expect a fine dining experience but the food was great and coffee yummy. What a wonderful breakfast.  We were just walking by and a couple had just left their table so we were very fortunate.  Dinner if the best home cooked food we had on our trip. A local cafe with nice friendly service. On menu it tells you food can be 15 to 20 minutes when busy but food is freshly cooked and piping hot. Nice coffee and dog friendly. Homemade food and beautiful flower/plant collection. I bought one for my work desk and It is just perfect! Almost everything they offer is handmade and the best part is it is pet friendly!!!!! so bring your pets in once life goes back to normal! Had some breakfast here. Friendly staff but a bit chaotic. Everything is cooked on a small cooking hob so it does take quite a while until you get your food. It also doesnt anything for the cooking smell. The food itself is tasty although a bit oily. One of the most tasty and beautiful handmade breakfast in my trip. We found it by mistake but it was the biggest pleasure of the day. The couple that they own the place cook our breakfast, both of them was very kind and friendly and the prices fare enough. Also we bought some handmade soaps and the gave us one more as a gift. Thank you guys. We gonna visit you again. A beautiful spot diagonally across from St Patricks Cathedral. There may be no name over the door but it oozes with character. Simple home made food prepared on premises Vegetarian options: A veggie option is always available Absolute Gem in the city! The owner is a wonderful Dog lover (dogs allowed), food is always on pointe, delicious and fresh. Small cafe, amazing atmosphere, myself & my dog Stevie are loving regulars. 5 STARS I love coming here, the breakfast is delicious and the atmosphere is always warm and welcoming and I can bring my dog. I couldnt  recommend the place enough and the owner always has alot of time for everyone even though shes always out the door busy with customers. Coolest little cafe in Dublin 8! I have visited this place and I couldnt eat the food. The owner that she is also a cooker touched and kissed a dog of some clients in a cafe and immediately after this went to cook our breakfast. Didnt even washed hands. She doesnt use any gloves too. The dishes and their kitchen looked quite dirty. Absolutely disappointing cafe. We just payed the bill and didnt eat at all. I dont know where inspections look... Run away from here because they have never heard about hygiene. Small hidden place where you can find nice things to eat! You feel like youre coming home to eat... Fast and very pleasant service, I highly recommend! The food was delicious. Like home cooking. The service was warm and friendly. The atmosphere was very welcoming. Food Great little local cafe. Ive been here a couple of times and service is excellent - so fast and friendly. Food is cooked to order right in the cafe. Highly recommend the smoked salmon and eggs its delicious! What a lovely place. Easy to come to, great care, lovely food (vegetarian sandwhich roll), beautiful chill music, lovely decorated. Would recommend Nice and cosy lunch spot, I had a delicious hot chocolate as well. There are just 2 people working though so food did take a while to come out. Nearby the Church so there is a very nice view So, this place has so many wonderful positives about it and I really want it to succeed. So I hope they take on this feedback. Comfortable, front-lounge feeling. We had the salmon breakfast which was really really great. Good flavours and well put together. The team working were lovely and patient. Very friendly. The major downside is the total absence of ventilation and that you effectively sit inside the kitchen, as the cooking takes place in the seating area, with no overhead extractors. The air was thick with smoke and grease. We left STINKING. Ive actually had to throw my hoodie out as I still cant get the smell out of it. Instead of seeing the cathedral we had to go back and shower and change our clothes first. In short. Lots of promise. Lovely crew, lovely food. Sort out a kitchen wall or extractor hoods. What a great discovery this place is. Laid back friendly atmosphere. Good food. Great coffee. Officially my new  Go To  breakfast place. Well done! Located in Dublins Christchurch Quarter, the cathedral cafe is but a short walk from the city centre. The venue itself is small with only a handful of tables available, and the style is rustic... very rustic in an almost is it decorated kind of way. My partner and I went in the brunch time, at which there was a short wait, that was however mostly due to folks sitting there for extended periods over empty cups ; one girl was already finished and sat there for over an hour without so much as another coffee. This isnt of course the fault of the venue rather than inconsiderate people costing small businesses revenue. The service was friendly and efficient and the food certainly without surprise.  Its nice to see a breakfast just being a breakfast without being crumbled or smashed or in someway deconstructed.  The almond and orange cake was delicious and moist, perfectly balanced with the hint of yoghurt on the side. All in all a not unpleasant dining experience if you excuse the sitters. Breakfast presented as it should be. We had the green breakfast and it was incredible. Eggs were perfectly well done, bread was fresh and amazing, and the vegetables tasted like they were fresh from the garden.  Loved the plants inside. Such a cool spot! A small, lovely place with literally the best green breakfast in Dublin (spinaches and mushrooms are amazing, with perfectly poached eggs and other vegetables). If you walk past St Patrick s Cathedral, this is an absolute must-try. Very traditional Irish breakfast as well. Definitely one of the best brunch you can get in Dublin! Come over and support small businesses, you can safely sit outside :) Absolutely awful. Over an hour to get some eggs. Had to ask for water and coffee after 30 mins. Woman was a rude witch too. The worst service I ve had in ages. Will NEVER go back Also just editing this now due to the owners reply. You should really learn to be professional and to spell. Fighting back at criticism is the epitome of ignorance! Awful experience here at the weekend. Service was so slow, was seated to a filthy table and had to sit in other people s dirty dishes for 10 mins. I ve read the reviews below and the owner is so unprofessional replying and gaslighting negative reviews. The place is a dump and the owner who was cooking had no hair net and her hair was filthy with grease. Actually feel sick thinking about it :( Happy to serve us food even if close to closing time. Lovely sense of community. Real people - just like we like them. Food was good and tea was excellent. Thank you! The food is excellent and homemade, the staff is absolutely adorable. I fell in love with this place and cannot wait to come back. I recommend the green breakfast (with spinach and wild mushrooms) Owner/chef is fabulous host gives the warmest local feel to the place and does amazing food, I go out of my way to support this wonderful cafe Fabulous soup and bread. Lovely, friendly atmosphere. Teresa is a wonderful cook. Super fast good reasonable price. I recommend Fab breakfast reasonable prices and the owner is just luvly Food was great, premium ingredients, service was quick, staff was friendly and accommodating.  Couldnt ask for more.  Prices were so reasonable, especially compared to the hotel restaurant. Cute little place with a small menu and good service. The food took a little longer than expected, but it was very busy and there was only two staff. It was worth the wait - Delicious Irish Breakfast was served hot and the tea was great! Well definitely eat here again before we leave. Thanks for the experience! The Irish breakfast is the best I have experienced in the city. The staff add to the character of the building. Its a hive of activity, that seems to be a hub for all types of characters. At one point the the cafe was full and all the customers were in conversation together. Which was a pleasant experience. Not only was I fed well, I was entertained too and I met some really interesting people. I came out with a full stomach and a huge smile on my face. Thank you for that experience. Beautiful, small cafe. Reasonably priced, but not able to serve the clients. It took us 30mins to get simple cakes. We were long done with our coffees, before they arrived. Tasty cakes and nice coffee, but you do need to get your act together, what comes to serving the customers. Strong   coffee  , homely breakfast *EDIT* Owner has suggested I am mistaken in identifying Cathedral Cafe, which is incorrect. I visited in 2018 and my account is accurate. She mistakenly claims I mentioned the older woman  shouting , or that I  had a dream there . As she clearly takes the time to read all reviews, praising the good and gaslighting the bad, I would suggest she read them a second time and perhaps consider the criticisms more closely rather than patronising her customers. I didn t think it was possible for my opinion of CC to get any lower, but the Owner has ensured it. It has been suggested the Owner is harvesting false 5 star reviews, which I cannot verify, but her responses here do not inspire confidence. Wrong order brought to table twice (by an older woman who didn t appear to work there?), then my juice went to the wrong table. Poached eggs were overcooked and watery, rest of dish not very tasty. Owner didn t seem to care about the service or dish; carelessly tossed her hand in the air and said  Eggs  benedict  to the waitress (older woman), as though it was a first   Shame as the place was a recommendation."
30,Catherine's Cafe & Bakery,3.75,"Dropped in for late breakfast after hospital appointment. Staff friendly, menu varied and food tasty and good - vegetarian breakfast except rashers which were stiff as boards. Place was busy so regular turnover. Would have preferred a pot of tea instead of cup (used to do same) Vegetarian options: Tasty and enjoyable except for rashers, generous portions. Parking: Good location in busy, friendly area near many great attractions. Wheelchair accessibility: Ok with walking aid. We went here for breakfast, the food was Quiete nice and reasonably priced 11.90 for full Irish., could not say the same for the atmosphere or service. If you are not a local do not bother coming here you will not want to come back. You are very obviously treated differently than other customers who are  regulars . Not even a thank you when paying and walking out the door. Atmosphere felt very off decor is nice but the overall vibe just made us feel uncomfortable and wanted to leave as soon as we walked in. Good food but we will not be returning. Today I was excited to try Catherine s Cafe, but I was treated so poorly I felt it was important to write a review. Even though we came in happy to wait for a table, or come back, I was told by the woman at the front desk that they had no space for us and wouldn t allow us to wait or return. I am super disappointed and surprised that someone would speak to us so disrespectfully after just entering the establishment excited to try the food and coffee. We won t be back, and I d recommend anyone, particularly those who aren t local, to look at the other cafes in the area instead of Catherine s. Really sad to have had a bad experience here today. Was there in there months ago and recommended to my friends that we make this a regular spot today. However, when we asked to be seated they said there was not space for three people and they didn t allow people to wait. Confused about this as there were multiple tables open and people were seated after us. Was it because we aren t Irish? Unsure and won t be able to confirm because we won t go back. Honestly am confused about this experience today. I was really looking forward to having breakfast at this restaurant however my experience trying to get a table was anything but lackluster. I was initially told by a hostess that it was too busy to get a table and said we couldn t wait or come back later for a table. Minutes later though I witnessed other groups being seated.This was really disappointing behaviour and my friends and I won t be back again. We both had a full Irish breakfast. It was a lot of food and it tasted great! The coffee was a bit watery, but the hot chocolate was very nice! The lady behind the counter looked a bit angry, but she was very lovely! Nice little stop for breakfast. Really good breakfast sandwich! Lovely place. Got some sweet stuff to take away. Great service. Salmon bagel was vile, bagel was soggy & cold. Came with no cream cheese and was covered in butter at the bottom also? Salmon also came cold :( waffles were okay, but had no berry compote. Had the eggs royale, tasted average (a bit too much lemon in the hollandaise sauce) but it was priced very reasonably. We had an Americano which was really good value for what you would get. Overall, had a good experience. Lovely place for breakfast. We ordered takeaway and it was delicious. Highly recommend. Great coffee and bread and cakes next door liberty history Sr Catherine bakery. Fair prices and the quality is fantastic! Loved the pancakes Environment and decoration is not the best, but the price and food quality are great, and the staff was very kind. Recommended full irish breakfast with tea! I love this place. I lived in the area for a short stint and this was my go-to place for bread, doughnuts, etc. People are incredibly friendly and its impossible to beat the prices. Look at this beautiful brown bread! We were happy to find this little cafe for a late breakfast. Got our day headed in the right direction! Wheelchair accessibility: The Cafe is accessible from the back of the building. Toilet facility was large with a number of grab bars. Spent a couple of days around the corner from this cafe last week and only had take-away coffee early in the morning on both days. Coffee was great - and I m very fussy and the warm, friendly lady who served it would give anyone a great start to their day. Sorry, I didn t ask for your name to thank you properly. Great place tucked away in a nice street to walk down. Reasonably priced and friendly staff too! Super friendly waitresses. They bring treats from the bakery into the cafe on busy days (I went on a Sunday) so you can still get delicious baked goods while in the cafe having a sit down breakfast. All the food I saw everyone ordering looked delicious. Savage little place, seriously the nicest cafe for everything specially cakes. Most places are selling literally pastry with a bit of cream classing them as cakes, here you get the real deal. Cakes are fantastic, coffee slices and those cakes are full of cream and flavour. I travel here most times just to buy from this cafe (even if that means getting stuck in traffic or taking 30/40 minutes) but well worth it. Parking can be really hard to get   it can be a nuisance- sometimes you might get some close to the main road and walk down to the bakery - again all worth it Such a pleasure to find a decent cafe serving freshly cooked food at a reasonable price - well done guys keep up the good work  stay fresh Traditional, old Dublin charm and atmosphere, from poets and painters to street traders and salt of the earth Dubliners, you never know who is going to be sitting at the next table The staff are friendly and welcoming and not pushing to move you on for the next customer. I would recommend the healthy option of porridge berries and seeds with the wholemeal toast, if you want to start a day of discovering Dublin and have a smile on your face, then head for St Catherines, I think they have one tomato to serve a days customers. Asked for a bit of extra tomato because no mushrooms, not mushrooms hidden under my eggs & not getting any extra tomato, I got 1/8th of a tomato. They asked us to move tables, which we happily did, but this caused such confusion to them, our food sat there for ages, the food waiting to be served is for the only table that doesnt have food in front of them. They also forgot the bacon. Its a bakery and they butchered our toast Great little Cafe with friendly staff and lovely food Defo recommend this place food is to die for staff lovely Weve ordered for delivery from this Catherines before but today we decided to go in and sit down and it was lovely, the staff are friendly and the food is great! Worst food we ve eaten in Ireland. Tasteless and practically inedible even after we tried to salvage it in our own kitchen. Salad smells like death. Absolutely do not recommend lunch from here. Service wasnt great. waited quite a while for our order and cajun chicken wrap had shredded bacon in it which was fatty and tasted sour. Breakfast was nice and prices are good Food I went with my mum (first time in Ireland for her) and we ordered the full irish breakfast. It was delicious! We also ordered decaff lattes which were way too strong, but the waitress brought us milk to compensate the taste. It was very busy when we got there and the waitresses were a bit stressed, but they were attentive all time taking care of everything and everyone. I recommend the place :) It is a small place but very cozy! Visited around New Year, lovely breakfast place, great service! Brilliant portion sizes. Loads of options for vegetarians which was great for me, fast service. Can t recommend enough and slightly cheaper than the more popular areas which was a bonus considering quality was just the same!! Lovely place,, we go there a lot from work fo breakfast and  is  always very nice, went with the family this morning, daughter was delighted with the pancakes, highly recommend. Went for breakfast with a friend. Waitress forgot us so we had to go and find our own menus. When we managed to order our food, people who ordered after us got their food first. I ordered Eggs Bennedic and my friend had 1 sausage, 1 hash brown and a small portion of scrabbled eggs which came to  8.50! When my friend asked why it cost that much she then tried to say she should of charged her more. Even tho you could order bits separate. The lady then proceeded to argue about how she should charge more even tho it was 3 items. My friend questioned her saying separate items are  1.20 and really it should be  5. The lady didnt want to listen and then decided to give  1 back and pretty much slammed it down on the counter. Unprofessional and rude if you asked me and the waitress could do with smiling a little bit more. Really helpful lady serving and made me welcome Delicious, generous Irish breakfast. Highly recommend. The service was fast and friendly, and the food was legit. When locals eat here, you know youve found a gem. Pleased to have visited Catherines and her brilliant employees. Terrible experience. Unfriendly if not hostile service. Coffee served in a paper cup, no sugar or anything. A woman named Catherine who I presume was the owner sat outside next to me to smoke, cig smoke blowing in my face, when asked about it, she just rudely replied Im outside, its for smoking. The coffee was alright at best and severely overpriced, probably even worse in taste after pieces of ash from her cig landed in the cup, but Ive decided to leave at that point. No idea why anyone would treat a customer that way, definitely dont go there. We went there for our last breakfast in Dublin. The food was very nice, but I remove two stars for the very poor service provided. I dont know why but one of the waitresses was super rude to us, not welcoming us, throwing us the menu, and not taking our order or even look at us to see if we were ready to order. Some people who arrived after us even had their food before us ! This person was nice to all the other tables expect us, and we were really polite from the beginning so I really dont know what happened, but it wasnt a really nice experience, and I am not sure I will recommend this place for this reason. Came in for a take-away breakfast: I have to say that this is the first place where I found a good coffee in Dublin and great pastries, even if they were made yesterday. Ordered chips and can of coke and to be nice for a friends birthday purchased her breakfast which was a mini the total came up to 13.20euro and then another friend at the same table paid for birthday girl breakfast as well. So they double dipped in payment and I saw them mark it off the order at the counter when I paid and said please let them I paid as I had to leave first... Wish I got a receipt now! Will not return. I collected a too good to go bag today and one of the cakes had mould in it. My grandson ate some of it before we noticed and Im hoping hell be ok tomorrow and doesnt get sick. We wanted to test the experience of bakeries in foreign countries (being French). The place was quite special, the pastries particularly expensive, personally I didnt really like them because they were very different from what were used to eating!"
31,Chancery Park,4.525,"Gorgeous park with a massive beautiful church. Love the water fountain, the brown ish building behind, and the cute little park at the corner. It s a wonderful place to relax and release some stress after work. There is a tram cafe there as well to enjoy such calming experience  to the fullest. A pocket park in the begining of the Chancery Str. Protected by raillings it has two entrance doors. The fountain in the middle offers is the greater surprise to the passerby. It is impressive how neatly clean the park is kept. I stayed five days at the near by hotel and never saw someone sitting on the three iron cast benches on the one side of the fountain! No matter what the park adds a nice brush to the surrounding area! It matches well with the brick built houses very close at the Ormond square. The benches are v nice and theres a lovely fountain too Today I was more than surprised by the fact that I could enter this nice little park. The park is an extension of Chancery House, a block of Art Deco style council built flats designed in 1934 by the then city housing architect, Herbert Simms. My understanding has been that the park was locked most of the time because of anti-social activity in the area. Today I discovered that a number of parks in the area have been re-opened to the public but in the case of Chancery Park access is limited to a few hours a day [8 hours Mon-Tues and 4 hours on Fridays with no access at weekends]. Maybe if enough people visit the hours may be extended. Small park with a small bit of history attached. It was a quiet spot in a busy area. Nice. An amazing little park to relax. It has a water fountain. Well maintained garden. I live in the area its a quite little community ive lived in chancery house since I was 12/13 & im 44this June love the area &everything is on your doorstep luas buses trains & the city centre town Absolutely beautiful little park, meet a lovely lady with her little dog, so peaceful in the had to believe it was in the city Lovely to walk past. It looks like its a private park. A lovely little bit of green catches the eye as you pass to the back of the four courts. Mostly locked as i pass by. Great peaceful place to sit and relax the fountain is hypnotic  calming Beautiful, small, calm Sweet little spot to sit by the fountain and enjoy peace and silence. Lovely little park and fountain Beautiful park in the heart of the city and my homeland. Very tiny but nice garden Herbert Sims classic. May you rest in peace Sir! Out of the way and lovely for a casual picnic or a quick break from work A pretty and well maintained small garden Nice benches, saw a cool dog One of the few heron sculptures in Dublin City Centre. Well hidden park - lovely for lunch hour. Clean park well maintained Nice quiet little park! Nice,,clean. Quiet It was quite and nice and clean Great little place for a break nan Beautiful little park.

32,Chillest Bench,4.666666666666667,"Traveled from the U.S. to experience the chillness of this bench. The reviews were all correct. This was in fact the chillest bench that has ever graced my cheeks. 10/5 would recommend Took a nine hour flight to see the Chillest Bench, did not disappoint. I even got to talking with the waiter, a little grey feathery fellow, and the stories he had were inspiring!! I went to chill on this bench , but I didn t realise it was the chill bench . Was supposed to only chill , lay low for about 10 mins. I ended up leaving the bench after 30 mins giggling with my eyes pure red . I strongly recommend prebooking a spot on the bench . I had to wait in line for about 15 mins to chill . Got really lucky and managed to get a seat in 15 minutes, should have pre-booked. Bench is extremely chill, great place for a cigarette and or a sandwich. I dont smoke but if I did I would on this very bench. I ended up drinking lucozade sport orange flavour with two of my friends. The view of the Samuel becket bridge, Dublin skyline, and light breeze make it undoubtedly the chilliest bench in Dublin. Hella chill bench... Almost missed my bus to the airport because i was so chill. 10/10, came here after having lunch at Eddie Rockets and it was very chill. Never forget this bench , used to walk past it on way to work in 2004. Beautiful view, chill bench, cant improve on it Terrible.  Not chill at all. Inspirierender Ort - Von der Bank hat man einem wunderschonen Blick auf die Samuel. Ecktet Bridge und die schicken Lofts auf der anderen Livey Flusseite. Netter Platz fur eine Sandwick Pause oder ein Picknick. Wir haben 10 Minuten gewartet und sind dann nach zwei chillenden jungen Mannern in den Genuss gekommen auf DIESER Bank zu sitzen und zu geniessen. nan nan nan nan"
33,Chorus Cafe Bistro,4.575,"Great experience. My second day in Dublin and second breakfast here! Yesterday I had the mini Irish Breakfast and was awesome! Today Sweet breakfast with homemade pancakes and hot chocolate! The place it s comfortable , cosy and well cared. Staff it s polite and welcoming! Went to see the spot where Handels Messiah debuted and thought this was an appropriate place to stop for lunch.  Sat next to a local who told me this is her favorite spot in Dublin!  Owner was friendly and happy to share the history of the place. Food was great and prices were reasonable.  If in the area again, Id definitely return! Amazing food and such lovely staff working here. We were delighted by how much choice there is on the menu for vegetarians. Definitely worth a visit! Vegetarian options: So many options for vegetarians. There was breakfast, starter options, paninis, pasta, omelettes, salads and sandwiches. Really are spoilt for choice. This Bistro, Chorus Cafe, is a must visit when in Dublin. We stayed at a hotel close by and ended up having all of our breaksfasts here, every day for a whole week. It was the best start of the day we couldve had. The food is delicious, lots of choiches, and the atmosfare is so relaxed and lovely. And the staff, so warm and welcoming, always doing their best for you to have a wonderful time with them. We highly recommend them! Food and service was very good and the atmosphere was lovely! A very nice an friendly place to eat a lunch in Dublin. Homemade and tasty food for a affordable price. Visit and enjoy. Friendly staff, all day breakfast - but not the best place for breakfast. I ordered a full Irish which was the biggest breakfast and it only came with 1 egg. Coffee was not free refills here either. My daughter got kids pasta and didnt finish it. This is a cute little cafe restaurant though, had a good hang session here with my daughter and we caught lots of pokemon on the free wifi from the hotel across the street. Cool ambiance inside as well, and when the weather is nice they have a patio in the back where you can eat. Little breakfast restaurant. Very yummy food. The price was okay. Not to much tables and seats to be honest, but we found easily a place to sit. To be recommended. Would leave no star if I could. Ordered a chocolate pistachio cake that looked gorgeous in the pictures. Quite possibly the worst cake/ more pancake that I ever had. No pistachios to begin with, price outrageous for a flour sugar combination from last week that was heated in the microwave and drizzled in chocolate sauce. Peanuts are not pistachios, not sure if this fact is known to the kitchen there. Absolutely disgusting! We , my two friends and I visited this lovely , friendly family run bistro twice. It was the best Lasagne we had ever tasted served with chips or salad. Then we came back for the Irish Breakfast and that was delicious as well. It is run by Mazza and Ciros a warm , welcoming couple from Persia. If you love sweets they were all home made by Mazza.  It has a water feature so you feel so relaxed when you walk in listening to the sound of water.  Then on the tables beautiful fresh flowers plus outside a patio area as well.  It is situated .near the end of Temple Bar.Thank you Mazza & Ciros and all the staff behind the scenes. If you get the chance to visit Dublin you must call in here . We loved it !!!    Julie, Margaret & Donna  xxx Dietary restrictions: Gluten Free Almond Biscuits Excellent for breakfast Very pleasant welcome Direct from this superb bistro/cafe, a wide choice of products, all irresistible! A warm and friendly welcome. I recommend +++ I really enjoyed my experience at this wonderful cafe. The outdoor courtyard is quiet and away from traffic. The food was very good (excellent club sandwich!). And it was nice to meet the owners who seem to genuinely take pride in their business and care about their customers. Highly recommended! Despite having been in Italy less than 2 week prior, the Chorus Omelet that I had here was inexplicably the best Pesto anything I have ever had in my life. My wife had the Full Irish Breakfast and also raved about it. Next time were in town, were 100% coming back This is the cutest spot ever for a breakfast with coffee to DIE for !!! What is not in the photos is the back patio with Umbrellas. I loved the eggs Benedict with the tiny edible flowers. Food This is a great cafe, the service is fast and the food is tasty. I love their panini selection and also their menu has something for everyone. Reasonably priced, a great spot for a lunch. Lovely Place to eat at if you cant find anywhere to your liking. It has a wide variety of different food and drink and the service is very good. Great place for breakfast! Staff friendly. Good prices! Great Cappuccino and Irish Coffee! Came with a group of 6 and the service was great! Love this cozy Cafe Bistro. It is a great spot for a relaxing break a few steps away from the busiest streets in Temple Bar. Very nice service, good food, full vegetarian Irish breakfast available We were looking for a place to eat a typical breakfast. The manager is really very nice, be careful cash only (he still accepted contactless). Everything was very good, a slightly unpleasant smell of fried food but you get used to it. Not too expensive Excellent breakfast! The little Irish breakfast was the perfect amount of food without being too much! Eggs Benedict and pancakes also looked amazing. Decor and ambiance leaves something to be desired, but good food! Morning guys , just a quick thank you. I just had the Egg Royal delivered to me for breakfast this morning. Compliments to you guys. It was the most magnificent Eggs Royal I have tasted in Dublin. Well done, I will be back for more. regds, Dave Great service and lots of food and bakery options.  Friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere Staff were polite but very slow. Avocado was out of a packet-no flavour and quite spicy even though there was no mention of spice on the menu. Poached eggs were hit and miss. One was lovely. Other was not cooked. Food says fresh but you can see them getting everything out of a packet. Waited far too long to pay after having been given the bill. Young girl was running around after everyone and man in the kitchen wasn t really doing much. Edit: Horrendous way to respond to constructive criticism. As I can see from your other replies too it seems you are just as rude online to your customers and you are in person. Would not recommend at all. Lovely cafe, food is great and the staff are super friendly. There is always music playing (hence the name) and all of their pastries and cakes are homemade too. Ate here twice for breakfast Very friendly, local cafe/bistro. Food is always a delight. French ambience. The food tasted good and was brought to our table quickly. They wanted to take my plate away though I hadnt finished yet. Afterwards they asked us to leave, but one of us hadnt even finished his tea yet! Finally, we wanted to go to the toilet, and while we were waiting, they again us to leave quite unfriendly. Not recommended, if you want to chat besides breakfast as we did not even have an hour to finish our breakfast. Really good food and the service was great. Friendly staff! Worth a visit Delicious food, great variety, friendly staff, quiet cosy atmosphere. Hidden away but well worth the visit. Cozy spot, amazing breakfast and friendly service. We randomly picked this lovely place for our meal and are so happy we did! We came for breakfast at 9:30am on a Sunday and really enjoyed our meal. The staff were attentive and welcoming, and the food was fresh and tasty, the coffee was nice. The outdoor seating in the courtyard is very pleasant. We would definitely come back! It was quiet when we were there but its probably worth making a reservation for a big group just in case they are busy. Thank you Chorus Cafe! The food and the size of it was average, breakfast is not value for money. There are better places in the city centre to eat in. Additionally this coffee shop has a poor ac so you are soaked with its smells. This Cafe on one of the most historic streets in Viking Dublin, is absolutely gorgeous. The owner and his wife are so helpful, accommodating and kind. I love sitting out the back patio on sunny days, food is gorgeous and very generous proportions. I would highly recommend this cafe to anyone loving or visiting Dublin. 5 STARS Loved everything. Would totally recommend Had a full Irish breakfast here. Best fried egg of my life and everything came out quick and delicious. Our server was friendly and helpful. The food was really, really nice, but unfortunately the coffee not so much. :( It was roasted too much and it was bitter. If I may give you an advice: please, change the coffee. Otherwise would be an awesome place! L.E.: it s really nice that you listen to your customers. Next time when I m in Dublin, I will be back for sure! Such a lovely little cafe, my son and I had breakfast here. Delicious eggs benedict with salmon good strong coffee served on a quiet terrace, the owners are very friendly and welcoming. A perfect end to a lovely weekend in Dublin, we will definitely come back Had lunch here today and absolutely loved it. From what I gather, the 2 people working were a husband and wife team and both were so friendly. Best omelette I ve ever had. Great coffee too. We came here for lunch based on our tour guides recommendation, and it was delicious! We had the chicken pesto panini and Greek salad and were delighted by both. If you come here, and you dont get the pistachio cake, youre wrong ;)"
34,Christ Church Cathedral,4.6,"Ruth Kennedy was our wonderful and very knowledgeable tour guide. This is a beautiful and educational tour of a historic sight in Dublin. There were children in our group and Ruth tried to keep them entertained as well which was very helpful. You can also rent audio equipment and do a self guided at your own pace tour. The audio could be helpful if you are hard of hearing. Wonderful gift shop also available for beautiful keepsakes and souvenirs. The cathedral is a magnificent one. Beautiful stain-glass windows. It has a larger crypt with lot of old artificets. Marvellous floor and Marbles statues. It has a good pipe organ, and a lot of antiques. Worth a visit. Please check the entrance times online - we stop by one day and it was closed for a three hour. And were not able to get back till three days later. It was well worth it it was Friday morning not too big of a crowd walk right here but we did have to pay an entrance fee, as well as at Saint Patricks Cathedral which was a little surprising as many cathedral throughout Europe are free to enter. But it was beautiful inside and great to walk around and look at everything and then go to the dungeons The cathedral has a Irish charm ans is absolutely rich with history. The audio guide is done very well with multiple paths you can take at each stop. The crypt is very cool to check out and is the oldest structure in Dublin. Its a bit pricy for for the tour, as its rather plain by European cathedral standards. We went in the evening. Its beautiful from inside. The priests were saying their words from the holy book. It quite big We walked in and there was no waiting to purchase is self-guided tour ticket. We took our time and were able to finish the tour in about an hour. They had 3:00 (15:00) Mass going on which added a nice touch to the tour. They offer guided tours for a higher price as well as family, student, and senior pricing. The stained glass windows throughout were amazing! Visited as a music venue today. Acoustics were very pleasing. Saw much architectural excellence that entices me to return. Visited on Weekday We went for the 5pm service, so we didn t pay anything to get in. We enjoyed visiting the church and learning about its history. They have costumes we can wear, so of course we loved the props. A GREAT cathedral! A must do if you are passing through Dublin! I had a wonderful time. Dont hesitate to do the labyrinth which is at the entrance outside, it is the same as that of Chartres Cathedral in France. It allows you to make a deep interior path. A lot to see in this cathedral, Strongbows tomb, St. Laurences (patron saint of Dublin) heart, original medieval tiles, and the spooky crypt. There is also a Belfry that you can climb and ring the bells but you have to buy a separate ticket for this. If you want the gift shop, you have to walk through the crypt. In general i would leave 5 but tell me the why generation by generation church become as a circus for clowns who likes be a different..Church would burn them that time but priests become same gays and hanging this flag? Whats all.about ? Christ Cathedral in Dublin (Ireland) - this historical cathedral is one of the citys tourist attractions. The cathedral has beautiful architecture. But we saw only a very small part of the cathedral, since further entrance was paid. Since we were just walking around the city, we accidentally stumbled upon this cathedral, we had no strong desire to walk through it all.  But for history buffs, I recommend it) Situated in Dublin s city centre, Christchurch Cathedral, formally known as the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, is a beautiful example of Romanesque Gothic architecture. There has been a place of worship situated on the site from an original church built by the Vikings in the 11th century. While originally Roman Catholic, it is now a Church of Ireland Cathedral. It was enlarged in the 13th century under the direction of Strongbow and suffered a major collapse during the 16th century. It was restored and extended to its current glory in the late 19th century with the addition of the tower and Romanesque flying buttresses. They also added the bridge section during this restoration. Today it still remains a place of worship with regular services. During other times it is a huge tourist attraction and, while there is a small entry charge, is a great visit while in Dublin. #Dublin #dublinireland #dublinstreets #dublinstagram #dublincity #dublinfood #dublinphotographer #dublinpub #dublinfoodie #discoverdublin #dublinrestaurants #dublinreviews #visitdublin Christ Church steeped in history, is well worth visiting and the grounds outside are a nice place to sit and relax as you watch people as they walk by Good location - walkable from the Dublin Castle, museums and Temple Bar area. Recommend buying tickets for the Cathedral, they have two levels to show. Outside park is free of charge. Actually I went in May 20222 but I forgot to leave a review. It was very beautiful place. And to avoid buying a ticket go there at the time of a service, in this way you enter for free, join the service and then can walk around for free. Visited on loved visiting the cathedral grounds. absolutely stunning and has some informational boards around the building. A very beautiful place that really exudes faith. The only downside is that it closes at 5 p.m., which is very early. Very pretty cathedral seen from the outside. Unfortunately we were unable to return. It was closed. However, the garden surrounding it is very pretty. Fascinating piece of irish history. Did the self guided tour, which is easy to follow. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. A Medieval Cathedral with a lot of history and is over thousand years old. An iconic building with wonderful interiors. I visited right after visiting Dublina and walked across the bridge from Dublina to Christ Church Cathedral. Its very impressive as you walk in and seems to be well maintained. I would recommend visiting if you have the time. I used Go City pass for my ticket, so Im not sure what the cost was. Very nice tour with an audio guide (with smartphone). Certainly a little expensive (11.50 euros per adult) but worth visiting. Very kind staff, various times of services and open to public. Interesting tour and definetely a spot to visit once in the beautiful Dublin! A very beautiful place definitely worth the visit, however, for a cathedral, the entrance fee is pretty high. One of main attraction in Dublin, beautiful cathedral with rich history and the stuff there was very nice incredible how history is alive here. go see the crypt and archway across the road. The building dating back to 1000 a.d. and its in such remarkable good shape, Beautiful, well worth a visit. The crypt is one of the largest. Very atmospheric. We really enjoyed our experience here. Its a beautiful cathedral, but that aside, the audio tour is well done. Its informative and engaging. It also offers multiple levels of understanding the cathedral, which I thought was really effective.  We love old churches and have toured lots of cathedrals. This one is on our top 5 for sure. Even our 7-year-old enjoyed herself. We highly recommend a visit. This cathedral has been here for almost 1,000 years. It is well worth a visit, and the history is fascinating. There are services every day. The sung Mass on Sundays at 11 am is a great experience. If you love architecture or are into history, you have to checkout Christ Church Cathedral. It s absolutely beautiful. We even got to sit in on a service and it was a nice experience. There s also a crypt in the basement that I found to be very cool. To visit in Dublin! Audio guide to download on your phone: it s practical! A little expensive though. One of the oldest structures and a must visit in Dublin It s not massive like what you see in Spain or Czech But nice This landmark is absolutely beautiful and filled with so much history. It is definitely worth it to buy a ticket and take a look around. Don t miss the crypt down below, and if you see Tom the guide, you should ask him a few questions about the cathedral, he has a lot of interesting facts up his sleeve! Its style is Romanesque and Gothic architecture, there is an obligatory stop in the city. You can pay a ticket to enter the church. Tom was the most amazing tour guide. Not only he had great knowledge about the history and interesting weird facts from the cathedral, but he was such a good storyteller. He was funny, clear, warm, and very entertaining. We had the best experience thanks to him! Amazing cathedral with a rich & storied history. The tile & stone floors are truly magnificent! The stained glass windows are glorious. In the crypt, there is the original copy of the transcribed Magna Carta that was adopted by Ireland. London , England was replaced with Dublin, Ireland, when it was adopted as law. To this day, the MC is still written into the Irish political doctrine. The courtyard is a great place to sit for a visit. Inside cathedral,  there is a daily service around 6pm. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  John & Tom are fine chaps. There are several stairs to get to crypt. Restrooms are in the crypt area near the gift shop. There is no street parking. Easy Uber or taxi drop off. 15 min walk from Jameson Distillery, 5 min walk fro. St. Patricks  Cathedral,  10 min walk to Dublin Castle. We did all in one day. Start or end at Jameson since you will need to RSVP a time there. 11 Euros to enter, and you can do a self guided tour, audio tour with choice of language,  or take the guided tour. This site is also part of the Go City pass, along with the other sites mentioned above. It is also a stop on the Big Bus Dublin. We purchased 3 day passes, and they were well worth it. Saved us a lot of money on entrance fees and transportation.  Cheers! Not the most mesmerizing, but has many Irish monuments its very well preserved. The floor tiles caught my attention, also has a huge organ pipe, looks recent but well integrated in the cathedral. 12  its a little bit to much for a ticket I recommend this visit. Little wait (less than 5 minutes) Incredibly beautiful! So glad we were able to go! Be sure to pick up your headset. They forgot to remind us and we walked around a bit before I went to see if there was a cost. There wasnt. Even my teen boys loved the audio tour."
35,Cinnamon Cafe,4.525,"Great experience overall! Ive never had such delicious porridge! We wanted to go back before we left but it is closed Sunday The coffee was also great! Also very convenient that you pay up front so we could leave whenever we wanted! Food Food is decent, but the salad is a bit over savery. Great service and environment! Lovely small Cafe in downtown Dublin. Great friendly service, by the owners I believe. We enjoyed strong and tasty coffees - a way to get a Saturday started. Good selection of pastries as well. Pretty big place with big enough tables as well. Nice atmosphere, waited way too long for a roll and my coffee was cold by then. That s why service gets only 4 stars. Roll was delicious though, and waiters very kind. Will come back What a lovely cafe with some amazing people. The best bakewell tart I ever did have. Certainly, it was a favourite place for me in the beautiful Dublin and my first stop when I come back. I loved this place - had breakfast here - simple scrambled eggs and toast - very tasty. The lunch menu looked really good, and the coffee is really good too. I loved that this is just a good, honest traditional cafe, with morning radio on in the background and newspapers to read. Served really quickly, food was great, coffee was incredible, atmosphere was great and so were the staff. The bread was especially good and HUGE! :) The place lacks character,all furniture looks old and neglected, toilets need cleaning and bit of paint wouldn t harm. Staff polite but looks like they are kept hostage there;) Food was good, coffee too but with competitors next door owners should put more effort into design and vibes. Food Charming little cafe, friendly staff and fair priced food and coffee. Also despite the retro/used look really clean. Definitely recommend it, especially because of the early opening time. Very good beagles for a reasonable price. Combined with the porridge and a cup of coffee, you have a nice breakfasts that brings you throughout the day The ambient is a bit rough - remembering to an old American diner. Stumbled across this cute little cafe on our way to the Jameson Distillery. Quick service and a hearty meal for very fair price! There were no scones on display. I had a sausage roll heated which was ok.  The service was good. I took the veggie bagel and the granola, and what to say .. the food was amazing, really tasty, and the persons was sooo nice!! Clearly recommend Food I was looking for place for lunch at Smithfield area and found Cinnamon Cafe with selection of soups (four different) plenty of sandwiches   and ciabatta options. I am very much  soup person  especially in autumn and winter. I got delicious beef soup! I haven t try coffee yet but definitely I will be back. Really lovely, had a very good time. Excellent coffee and the cheese sandwich was so delicious. One of my fav spot Went randomly into this cafe looking for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. I had a cappucino, which was good, and a breakfast ciabatta, which was absolutely amazing. Really recommend checking it out. 10/10 Nice little cafe, delicious pastries and they make a very nice creamy latte. Went here with my friend. Lots of options to choose from. They have flavour coffees here which I saw after I ordered. I got a small break of Scrabbled egg and toast with sausages and coffee. My friend got Scrabble egg and toast and coffee. Lovely breakfast and great service and reasonable prices. Just 2 drinks ordered and they managed to forget, 4 tables were served before and despite my attempts to call no glance towards the tables... no effort of apology, too bad. Very cozy little breakfast place - the coffee us a rad on the bitter side but the food us delicious, especially the hot wraps (recommended: Cajun chicken ). All at a fair price, beating neighboring hipster spots such as urbanity by a mile. Got a small flat white and a tint cake. Cake was stale obviously yesterdays. It was 8.25 euro Great coffee and service. my mornings wouldnt be the same without stopping in for a take away coffee!! Perfect for breakfast, eggs and bacon with delicious homemade ketchup Great food, great coffee! Swing by and fuel up for a great day ahead! Had the basic breakfast of bacon, eggs, and gluten free toast. It was lovely; came with three pats of butter, a delicious jam, some green onions and a spriglet of parsley. Four stars only because the portion is a bit meager for the price. However, if 8.5 euro is really the going rate, then the quality is up to snuff, and its clearly not a chain establishment, which seems to be increasingly rare in big cities. Dietary restrictions: Gluten free toast available Best Chai Latte Ive had! BLT was generous and tasty. this place is awesome! the people who work here are super nice and the food is great!!!!! Lovely little cafe with friendly staff, good food and great coffee. What more could you ask for right beside a Luas stop. And all reasonably priced as well. Had the breakfast Ciabatta and it was exactly what the doctor ordered. Top marks. Very cozy place, tasty food and nice staff The 2 ladies working there were an absolute delight. Very efficient and hard working as well as extremely accommodating. We just came off the back of a 33 hr travel plan and had a load of baggage which they were very kind to allow us store and recharge our phones. Not our first time at Cinnamon but cant rate it highly enough! See ye next time Beautiful eggs, good coffee, saved me well this morning Simple breakfast options well cooked and presented. Found this   of a place where the food is outstanding the staff friendly I would highly recommend a visit A little super cool gem . Excellent pastry . Just one suggestion DO NOT order a dairy free cappuccino will ruin your day I came here in the morning for a quick breakfast before catching my train. I ordered their eggs & bacon along with an iced coffee. The food was filling and came quickly. Brilliant little place. Sandwiches are delish Food Great place for breakfast and for a lunch sandwich or a soup. Coffee and cappuccino are so good and tasty. A nice independent coffee shop, with loads of outside seating. Reasonably priced for the area with speedy service, and staff were very friendly in dealing with us. I would definitely return, really tasty leaf tea was a big hit for me. Much better than the big chain outlet next door. A very lovely place for breakfast and lunch, service and cuisine are just perfect Best coffee you can get in here! Have tried quite few places and decided to stick with them! Girls are working there also very pleasant. Well done Food"
36,City Kayaking,4.95,"A truly unique experience! I highly recommend this activity. Its great for beginners and for those with more experience! Our tour guide Jonathan was so friendly and the musician we had,  Fin, was very good! We will definitely be downloading his music!! A great way to learn about the history of Dublin whilst seeing it from a unique location. Guide was highly knowledgeable and engaging. Highly recommend! This is one of the best gigs I have attended in my life. Amazing kayak trip, very easy and friendly, but overall, it was absolutely phenomenal to hear the acoustic under OConnel bridge. Thank you so much! I literally came to Dublin for this unique experience and it didn t disappoint! As a child I d seen a picture of someone kayaking through the city and it ended up being my very first impression of Dublin. It was a rare rainy and windy day in Dublin s summer but Mr Jonathan still managed to help us beginners have a smooth and fun ride, all while happily sharing his abundant information about Dublin I d never known before! It offered a perspective you can t get just by walking around the city and I m so glad I finally managed to fulfil this dream of mine. Really fun activity for anyone, you don t have to be particularly fit and the activity is suitable for families. (If you do want to go a bit harder, you can too). I thought the tour was informative and definitely original. The staff was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Great experience all around We were blessed with a lovely evening but I would ve enjoyed it if it was raining! I went with my 13 year old daughter and she adored it. Great staff who made the event enjoyable, paddling wasn t too challenging and the music under the arches was magical. Would definitely recommend, it was a brilliant two hours. A wonderful way to spend our first evening in Dublin. We took the musical tour under the bridges. A seal joined us for part of the trip! Really nice activity to see the city from a different point of view. Friendly staff and good equipment. During the paddling there is a guy from staff with boat that take picture of you for free. Highly recommended. But bring a spare clothes with you! Great city adventure that let s you experience city center through a whole new perspective! The kayaking experience was fun, easy and we were able to get beautiful pictures (and awesome memories!). This experience is great for families, friends, couples, even solo! You get about 2 hours to explore a nice stretch of the Liffey (from Capel Street Bridge to the Samuel Beckett Bridge). Someone from the company is always at hand (they cruise around on a motor boat) if you need any help, but you re left up to your own devices, so you can enjoy the views, get a bit of a workout, float for a while, take some great pics and even interact with people on the bridges. Great fun! Highly recommended. The price is more than fair ( 25 pp), the staff was responsive, friendly and knowledgeable, and the process (from booking to kayaking) was a breeze . Very fun and informative kayaking experience. Our guide Lee gave good information about the city of Dublin and its history. He was very kind and patient with all participants. We rented kayaks for a couple of hours and did not have a guide with us. We  had lovely time kayaking at our own pace, but got a bit wet and cold. It was a cool sunny day in May. Definitely bring some dry change of clothes with you if you can. Great experience! 100 % recommend people who like to see Dublin in a fresh and calm perspective (on a sunny day of course). 5 star for our lovely guide as well! Amazing weather luckily! Great tour, amazing way to see the city and a bit different. Suitable for all abilities which is great. Slightly harder if your an odd number as someone has to go alone but our guide was lovely, would do it again This was such a fun experience and great way to explore Dublin. The tour guide, Michael was brilliant! He explained use of the kayaks clearly and gave informative and interesting facts about the sites we kayaked past. This is a fun, safe and different experience which I would thoroughly recommend! One word... INCREDIBLE. This is a very professional set up with all the necessary water proof gear provided and a very patient and knowledgeable guide. What I really appreciated about this kayaking was the knowledge gems that we received all along the river regarding the history of Dublin. The river was quiet and everyone was allowed to row at their own pace, I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants an adventure and a quirky way to learn more about the city of Dublin. One of an amazing activities I have been tried in Dublin, and I recommend it strongly. We absolutely loved the music tour, highly recommend This was a great experience we got to see the city from a fresh new viewpoint , while experience a new activity. We tired ourselves out and were drenched but it was worth it If you are looking for fun and see Dublin city from a different perspective city kayaking will give you that!!! Amazing day, lovely instructor, curious histories about Dublin bridges and buildings. Great craic, the guide was knowledgeable and patient with those completely new to kayaking! We even got to see some seals Brilliant experience with music under the bridges.  A must do 2 hours if you have the time. Fantastic experience. Really unique way to see Dublin. Staff very helpful and friendly! Great way to see the city. Great tour, really friendly staff. The boys loved this activity and they got a bit of a history lesson along the way. Our guys were 11,14,17 and their Fav Uncle it was a Fun few hours spent on the liffey .Bring a change of clothing Their Bottoms got wet frim splashing We would 100% recommended City Kayaking Amazing few hours kayaking on the liffey ..music under the bridge is a must. Great idea, such a nice way to spend an evening. Anyone can do it! Defo wouldnt be keen in the bad weather but mild or sunny weather and youll have a great day! Nice way to see the city in a slower down pace! This is not to be missed.. Beside the Jeanie Johnston ship.. Hire of a kayak wetsuit( if needed) instructors/ guides..on the River Liffey ..it is fantastic..and as an added bonus ..the guys will give you a history lesson.. Excellent.. 35 For all of the above..if you have never kayaked or even if you have..give this a go... This is amazing I would thoroughly recommend it.  I was such a cool and unusual way to see the city and it was great fun.  My Kayaking experience was none existent but that didnt matter all abilities can enjoy. Amazing experience! It was my first time on a kayak and loved every minute of it Pro tip: whatever the guide says, TAKE THE PLASTIC PANTS OR YOULL GET SOAKED We went on the musical bridges tour and it was a unique and very engaging experience. A good combination of beautiful Irish music combined with the physicality of kayaking down a fairly uncooperative river made for a lovely couple of hours. The musician during my outing was Clara (Im not sure if I spelled that right) and she was incredible. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing Irish folk ballads as well as some of her own original stuff which was equally enthralling. I definitely recommend this especially if you have a couple of hours free in the evening It was amazing! Thanks to Lee, our guide, for this magical experience. Its a nice and different way to enjoy and know more about the city. Did a guided tour with Jack. Even though it was really windy and a bit cold, we had a great time. Jack was full of interesting tidbits, and also seemed to have the safety issues well in hand, even with a somewhat rambunctious stag party booked into our same time. Its a lovely way to see the city from a different perspective. Very friendly staff and extremely wholesome activity, really some of the best fun Ive had in a long time Great experience of Kayaking. You can go with your partner and enjoy this experience in middle of city chaos. My partner and I had a great time on the music tour. I am a big guy, but our guide was very accommodating to help with equipment and the process in a very understanding way. The music under the bridges was wonderful and relaxing (shoutout to Brona Keogh) and while the water was cold and the weather was a bit glum, it was still a nice experience without being overly physically challenging. The kayaking itself is great and the guys give you freedom. Boats are decent price is great. Beware of the little scrotes swimming though, they capsized one of us. Sewer Rats! What can I say !!   what an amazing experience !! We loved it, our son was blown away with it. Paddling down the capitals river thats steeped in history , just to be able to paddle underneath the bridges alone was incredible. The halfpenny footbridge in all her glory in the sunshine. Our guide and mentor for the trip was Johnathan. What a super decent guy. He was able to put us at ease within minutes and kept us safe for the few hours we spent with him. We made it all the way up to Guinnesses brewery before turning back down again. The views of Dublin from the river are a must see, bring a change of clothes and footwear as getting splashed is part of the fun. We found the Hilton Hotel carpark perfect to get in and out. Toilets at the hotel were handy and parking is reduced if you eat in the hotels Olys restaurant ( very reasonable prices and food was amazing) have your parking ticket handy when leaving hotel, reception will zap the ticket as you leave.( every little helps!!) As a family outing its perfect, fun and very rewarding. We plan to go back later in the year and aim to get up as far as chapelizod if we can. Arrive ahead of time, groups often get delayed and it can impact others booked for the same time. Also, a good pair of waterproof leggings or just light waterproof clothes help. Wet suits not really needed but it can be windy so a warm top will help. 10/10 you will love it. A great experience, even in the rain. Fun, completely safe and perfect for all levels, including complete fools! While you should always pay attention to the weather in dressing, you warm up pretty fast once you get going! Its a great way to see the city from a new angle. The lads are well informed and instill confidence in the experience. Prepare to get wet but its worth it Lee was an amazing tour guide! We had a blast and learned a lot about the city from him. We highly recommend this tour, it was our first full day in Dublin and a great way to see the city. Lee was very informative and a great tour guide. Would five 6 stars is possible!! Absolutely fantastic, highly recommended for all ages.  Sarah was so helpful with organising the day and Johnathans knowledge of Irish history allows you to see the city in a whole new light.  There is something wonderful about traveling along the quays away from the chaos of the city, while literally being in the middle of it, the views are amazing.  Safety is paramount, so no need to worry,  our groups ages ranged from 8 years old, to teenagers, then 40 plus and everyone had a ball."
37,Clement & Pekoe,4.05,"The decoration is simple and comfortable, with the wooden tables and chairs make it feel very warm. making me feel no pressure and no sense of distance. A very comfortable atmosphere, where you can completely relax. The layout design is very good, and the appropriate space design give the entire space a unique structure and sense of space. The hand-brewed coffee tastes good with two flavors to choose from. Pairing with dessert. We chat and spend a wonderful afternoon. Hate to do a bad review but feel like I have to after yesterday Wanted to try this place for a while don t live in Dublin so as I was here it was the perfect time to try. Got an iced coffee for takeaway and all was fine, staff were nice. Did have to get another straw in circle k as the first one cut into the lid and wasn t able to use it. When I finished the drink I wouldn t usually look into the cup but noticed a black hair around the end of the straw! Instantly felt sick because of the thought that I could have swallowed that! I don t have black hair so couldn t have been mine which is disgusting! I hope for the future you can be more careful with your drinks!! I visited Clement & Pekoe in Dublin on a Monday afternoon, drawn by their renowned tea selection. My first impression was that the staff seemed quite dull and cold. Knowing their specialty, I ordered a chai latte and a peanut butter brownie. Its worth noting that they only offer sweet treats, with no savory items available. Unfortunately, the chai latte was very disappointing the spices werent strong enough and it tasted watered-down, falling short of the expectations for a tea-specialized cafe. The peanut butter brownie was decent and satisfied my craving. The cafe allows laptop users during the week, which is great for digital nomads. The branding and interior are charming, but unfortunately, theres little else to entice me to return. Coffee is tasty but they are unfortunately following the new trend of giving every drink in a flat white size cup. This is a cappuccino, it fits in the palm of my hand. I can t fault the coffee at all but it s just unfortunate to be paying full price and getting a drink that s half the size it should be. The best of Single Origin coffees whilst watching the world go by in the hang out area of South William Street.  Only cafe in Dublin with steps to lounge and chat a Saturday morning away on. Treated myself to their cappuccino made with a rich nutty Ethiopian coffee for  3.50. Would love to keep this understated oasis to myself yet the food tour guide in me wins out. Hang out here like a Dubliner in the know. Fantastic place to have a delicious specialty coffee and do a spot of people watching in the heart of Dublin! I hear the tea is also out of this world. Super nice coffee spot. Offers all your espresso based drinks with milk alternatives. Matcha tea, chai latte, a lot of loose tea leaf options, filter coffee like V60 , French press, aeropress, Chemex as well as batch brew. Also offer decaf. Generous seating area with a bright nice vibe. Friendly staff. Welcoming for all. It simply is the best coffee for me in Dublin. Hands down. For tea lovers: they also sell loads of different types in the back of the cafe. Food This is a great coffee and tea shop. The latte I had from here was quite excellent. Even higher marks however go to the tea blends that they put together - their Irish breakfast blends are really quite fabulous. We took various bags back with us. Service was focused and friendly, and the place has a nice decor. I stumbled upon this tea shop on my last trip to Dublin. I was warmly welcomed by Darina(who I met at the tea tasting a few hours prior). I came into the shop sweating buckets after a long walk from just outside Dublin City centre(didn t know where I was as I m not completely familiar with the bus stops in Dublin City ) and she gave me a complimentary glass of water and a mug of what looked like Turkish apple, mango and mint tea. The atmosphere was very lively which was good. I was even able to look at the tea menu to see if there was any other teas I would like to try. I would definitely love to come here again and have another cup of tea, maybe even a baked treat. I ended up ordering a few bags of tea online and delivery was fairly quick. I highly recommend the summer fruits tea. I personally wouldn t recommend the Turkish apple tea(without the mango and mint). If you are looking for Melbourne quality coffee, this place won t disappoint. Great atmosphere and service was excellent too. Ordered a coffee and a tea. Unfortunately after a while has to go back as the order hadnt come and they had forgotten. The tea, coffee and sweets were ok. Really loved the vibe. The absolute best, and if you get a window seat - even better Cute and cozy, seems tiny from the outside but theres actually plenty of seating in the back the coffee is outstanding and the staff are super nice. Its quite popular though so could be quite some waiting time We got there expecting to have a sit, but it was only after we ordered that weve been told to sit outside because they were closing. We also included four different pastries that were supposed to be chocolate-something according to the labels at least. Finally we got our coffees, a pair of barely decent lattes with really nice hearts that could be fine if we hadnt ordered capuchinos instead. The pastries... What could I say? Far from what we expected by the look and labels in the counter, they were mostly oat with butter covered with a thin layer of chocolate. Our deception was such that we got speechless, wondering how would this place could have this high rate. It seems like a really nice place. Was our experience was just an unhappy coincidence? I rather keep the doubt than coming back. Consistent good coffee! Best coffee in Dublin and pastries are really good also! Wonderful Americano. Very mediocre banana muffin. Clean, well equipped rest-rooms. Food : 3/5 A really nice relaxing coffee shop in the city. And they do have an amazing good quality of coffee and good tea also, if you prefer filter, they always have two filters on the board everyday. Like the vibe like the staff, clement and pekoe is amazing! Don t come here if you re American  a friend and I came to do work on our laptops and after sitting down for barely two hours, were told to leave. Employee was very rude to us and was clearly just having a bad day or generally xenophobic. A nice place with good coffee where people can work during the week. When I visited the place it was very cold inside, which made it difficult to actually enjoy the space. Food The service here is noticeably better than any other independent coffee unit based in Dublin (using independent here as Coffee Angel has top tier service as well). The staff are very kind and considerate when it comes to bringing orders over, even when you sit outside and order something elaborate. Chill place and all staff are kind and really seem to know their stuff. Parking: car park down the street. A really nice place, looks smaller on the outside I ordered raspberry pie and Kenya. Coffee is really good, with fruity aroma and only a bit of bitterness. The cake isn t too dry and is really tasty! Great central cafe with one of the best quality coffee in the capital. The cafe is bustling and offers a nice selection of sweets to accompany their perfect coffees. Needs a bit of a scrub up and paint job but the quality is in the cup. Very good coffee and hot chocolate. However, probably the most expensive coffee shop in Dublin. Inside is ok but quite crammed and uncomfortable chairs One of the best coffee spots in Dublin with a great selection of pastries Good place to read or get some work done. Great spot out on the steps to people watch. Their coffee isn t my favourite but they have some good options for tea and the snacks are really yummy. No laptops on weekends. Simply one of the best coffee shops in Dublin. I would highly recommend as coffee is delicious. If you sit in there is a nice vibrant atmosphere as do quick meet ups in here all the time. Had an iced coffee with unflavored syrup, and it was great. Theres a lot of seating available and its mostly busy due to its location, but I was there at an odd hour, so it was pretty much empty. They have a good selection of tea, coffee and coffee machines inside that you can buy (tea/coffee based on weight). Ive loved this coffee shop for years but I recently bought a flapjack which had peanuts in it and was not labelled as having them. Peanuts are an easy one to label for given how common and severe this allergy can be, and given you wouldnt think that a flapjack might contain them. I think its in their interest to label for this. The purpose of my visit was to purchase loose leaf tea. There is a second till in back that is dedicated to tea sales. The shopkeeper who helped me was very knowledgeable and still managed to never make me feel stupid. I left feeling like I had a new friend. Their prices are very reasonable and I left with LOTS of tea for myself and for travel gifts. Their default size is 100 g. But they can upsize if you want more. Naturally you do. Coffee is always amazing in this place! Outside bench in the sun on an Irish summers day is my idea of perfection. However, very cute and cosy inside area! Music was calming, made me feel calm inside. Staff are lovely as always! Me and my friend was served lukewarm chai latte, what basically was a diluted milk (more latte, than chai) with sugar and small hint of cinnamon. Not worth 4.5 euro, to be honest. And definitely not what you expect in a wintertime. The coffee jars installation on the wall looked like an ashes display. I found it hilarious. Food Solid espresso, nothing crazy good though. Also a tasty housemade kombucha, although would have liked some fizz. Snacks and treats were delicious as well! Liked it a lot, bright airy and eventhough it was full, wasnt too noisy. Perhaps because the layout doesnt lend itself to big noisy groups as well as the 3 rooms meant muted acoustics. Nice latte too - not too strong, not too milky. Will go again. One of the best coffee shops in Dublin city. A beautiful store with a magnificent range of wholebean coffee bags to purchase. The serving coffee is of excellent quality; nice and rich in taste. The staff and atmosphere are delightful and friendly. A terrific place for good coffee! So glad I randomly walked by C&P while I was in Dublin.  Cute little tea room with a great communal seating area in the back and a huge tea selection.  I ended up ordering a few bags of different breakfast teas online when I got home to California and it was delivered in about 10 days.  Thanks for offering international shipping!  Every cup will remind me of my amazing time in Ireland. Lovely little spot and spacious inside, very nice when its not crowded its very comfortable and cozy inside Great coffee and a lovely place to catch up with friends! Disappointing coffee. Went for an americano and it was nearly tasteless. It would be nice if the staff didnt slam the doors of the cupboards or if something was put in such that it didnt make a massive bang every time theyre closed as this somewhat interrupts the ambience. On the positive side, I sat at the front window and the view was nice for people watching and the music was good! The cafe itself is also very pretty and it seems all the staff get along well with one another which is nice to see. Not a welcoming design. Music is so loud. The stools are uncomfortable and you only get 30 mins of wifi. Its not a Starbucks nor an Italian cafe. The pastries are ok. Basically the experience is not that special. Laptops not welcome on weekends. It doesnt add up.. Excellent cortado! Great flavor and perfectly balanced. The cafe is easily accessible and the staff is friendly. Highly recommended!"
38,Cloud Picker Cafe,4.725,"Probably the best espresso I ve had anywhere or ever. A truly incredible experience from such a small amount of liquid. Looked to have a lot of good cakes and pastries for sale too alongside coffee equipment and beans for sale. recent fav cafe in terms of aesthetics! the flat white was good, creamy but not so thick. loved the art, a beautiful lily of the valley. the space feels airy and light, perfect for a sunny day where light pours through generously. the outdoor seating area is small but cute, although the view is meh, just cars coming and going. the projector down the alley indoor plays some (independent?) films, quite a vibe. lastly if you bring your own cup, it s 25 cents off :) I love this place! The coffee is amazing and they have so many options and flavours. They are also dog friendly (big+). Been getting cloud picker beans delivered for a while but first time visiting the cafe. Great coffee and setup inside. Highly recommend a visit Amazing coffee shop! If you want to enjoy an amazing coffee, thats your place! 3.1 for an amazing dark with cream double expresso in a nice glass (you cant ask for anything else). Great experience, I will definitely come back! Great coffee! And really cool vibe. Pastries look amazing. They also have a nice selection of coffee related necessities if you are making coffee at home. There are a few places to sit inside and outside, but you need to get a bit lucky that they aren t too busy. Beware sizes are smaller than chain coffee places. Super welcoming and knowledgeable staff. Had a great Thailand premium pourover and little white chocolate covered dolce de leche pastry. Super cute spot with a wide selection of awesome coffee. Will be coming back thats for sure. Dublins smallest flat-white at  3.65  - complete rip off. There are better coffees, in bigger portions at lower prices in the same area. Never, ever be back. I am from Australia and I visited this cafe last week during my holiday trip with my family. I have already heard about this place from my friends but I felt over the moon when I actually  visited it. The atmosphere, food, and ambiance was outclass. Miss madeeha served me the food and coffee. She is very soft spoken and didnt disappointed us. I will definitely reach out again before going back to Australia. I can highly recommend this place to everyone in Dublin. Coffee didn t stand out but the cafee itself made up for it, cute interior design and chore jackets on the staff. Great selection of space cakes (Media Luna Croissanterie) - we d like to get our hands on more of these stocked throughout Dublin. Nice staff. View of the road and Trinity gym. Could do with a better view but understand it s in a prime location next to Trinity. Not enough space to work in nor enough space for a good hang out. More of a take away place in our opinion. The Good: The coffee is excellent. The Bad: the food, particularly the pastries look better than they often taste The Worst: twice now I ve ordered a pastry and it s been stale and old. For the prices, this is unacceptable. Food : 2/5 After being in Ireland for a week and trying different coffee places, I am convinced that this is the coolest place with the most authentic approach to good coffee. Definitely want to come back. Thanks! You can grasp the hint of the beans tasting notes from the flat white. Lovely latte art too. A professional sophisticated atmosphere to enjoy a perfect cup of coffee along with the pastries that you love. The shop seems to be a guild of coffee that you get a feeling of being in a coffee world. If you like this kind of light-roast 3rd wave hipster coffee (which I do), this spot does great work. We ordered two different espressos (espressi?) and they were both excellent. Lovely atmosphere and great service but the coffee is really bitter and I haven t enjoyed it both times I ve been there. I had the Iced Lavender latte and wish there was more ice and oatmilk because for $5 the cup was not filled to the top. I would also not recommend studying here because all of the chairs are uncomfortable and impractical. Overall hoping for better for this shop because the interior is very nice. A modern and stylish coffee shop serving great coffee roasted in Dublin. Staff are always really friendly and know their stuff about coffee. If you arrive early, you might be lucky enough to snag one of the artisan croissants, they are some of the best in town (dont try and eat it in one sitting though!). Cloudpicker also sell an array of coffee making equipment, including grinders, brewers and filter papers. The prices are actually pretty reasonable too, from my experience they are pretty much in line with what you would pay on the web, give or take a few euros. In conclusion, a great spot for coffee lovers and fans of decadent pastries! Visited this place one morning for a coffee and a pastry. Staff were really friendly, vegan pastry options were on offer, and we also bought a box of coffee beans. They sell lots of coffee-related merch and equipment too! Highly recommended coffee spot Great coffee place. As good as some of the best with fantastic coffee, coffee-people and food for coffee! My first coffee shop hunting in Dublin. Absolutely AMAZING    love the way they promote  zero waste . The coffee is amazing and also the poppyseed cake! I would definitely recommend cloud picker Very nice little place. Pricey, 30  4 flat whites and 4 chocolate croissants. But everything was delicious. Nice lil coffee shop in the heart of Pearse street. Welcomed by friendly staff. Arvin was very friendly and informative, answered my questions very well. I did not get the name of the barista who made my coffee as there was a customer but delighted with my cup of flat white.  Lovely lil spot for chats while enjoying a nice cup of coffee Amazing coffee. I got to finally get back into the city and get a coffee Cloud Picker. I also had my first vegan pain au chocolat, as a dairy lover, I was a little sceptical if I m honest when the barista assured me the taste was as good, he was right  and it didn t disappoint. In fact, possibly one of the nicest I ve had outside of France. I will defo be revisiting on two accounts now, the coffee and vegan pain au chocolat! Thank you I dropped in to pick up some coffee, but ended up chatting to the barista and got some fantastic advice for dialing in with my new grinder... It was really invaluable, and also talked me through the flavours with espresso. Genuinely made my day better and Im close to getting my home espresso right Parking: Loads of space for the motorcycle... This place is amazing! They offered the best coffee and showed the best attitude to its costumers. Such a friendly and professional staff. Speciality coffee, has equipment for self prepared filtered coffee. Nice pastries and good quality coffee. Great filter and amazing service. The playlist is fire as well which is always a nice bonus. The best coffee in Dublin with staff that is always so kind and helpful :) Oh and the croissants? We had the one with apple crumble and with apple & cinnamon puree and it was a piece of heaven! Definitely will be back Amazing coffee!! Lots of options for espresso or filter coffee. Pastries were nice too. You can also buy beans and other coffee merchandise here. Dietary restrictions: Vegan pastries available It s a nice place to have a cup of coffee outside. And the coffee was smooth and delicious. Hands down best coffee in Dublin. I absolutely love going to a cafe, seeing the Cloud Picker logo in the window, and knowing Im about to get a great coffee. Recently picked up some bits to start making cold brew at home and the equipment I picked up has been ideal and the staff were super helpful helping me pick it all out & grinding the beans I needed. Special shout out to Anna Maria, who put me onto one of their coffee varieties that had been fermented in the process. Honestly one of the best cups of coffees Ive ever had & I still think about it often. Ill be back for more for sure. My only wish for the cafe is that there was more space to sit inside. Best coffee in Dublin, really feels worth the money! Not many seats but its a lovely place with great music and friendly staff. This my go to spot for take away coffee in the area. Always love their filters, the space is awesome and the staff are always extremely friendly! It is also very refreshing to see that they take eco initiatives very seriously :) During most visits to a new town that I haven t visited before, I try to locate the coffee roasting facility that is pressing the best espresso in town. Cloud picker left nothing to be desired. They are at the top of their game, with a refined, technique-oriented third wave quality that is truly world class. You won t be disappointed. My go to Cafe whenever visiting Dublin. Good walkable location, lovely atmosphere and great filter coffee Best coffee in Dublin! These people are fantastic at what they do Really good coffee. Had an almond croissant too that was good Excellent: a fabulous selection of coffees and delicious pastries. The staff are knowledgeable, welcoming and friendly. My only complaint is that its not big enough - it can get a bit crowded between lectures at the college across the road. average coffee but cool spot and good service Finally had a chance to try this specialty coffee shop even though I study right across from the store. Unfortunately was left a little disappointed as my espresso was quite underextracted. Seems like a genuine good place though so may give it a second chance soon. Edit: Went back for a 2nd go and glad I did as the coffee was good! Lovely latte art too. Most likely just unlucky with the first shot. Lovely space and for sure will be back."
39,Cocobrew,4.575,"Hands down the best coffee in Dublin, the cafe has a cozy atmosphere and the baristas are so kind and welcoming, its my go to spot :) It is a cozy place to have and enjoy a coffee, in other hand, croissant was not fresh Nice little coffee. The flat white was good. However the one with ist milk seemed off, maybe it was the milk or the specific brand but I definitely had better ones, before. Coffee prices are good but the snack prices are quite high. 7  for a cheese toastie is just crazy. Nice little coffee shop, good food and friendly staff The enviorement and vibe once you are there its awesome, especially when the kind and gentle guy Carlos is working. He make you feel you are at home. Delicious coffee and excellent service!! I highly recommend this place. This speciality coffee shop is well-located, and the place is cosy and cute. Best coffee experience so far. Delightful staff, great location at the heart of Temple Bar but somehow neatly tucked away from the hustle and bustle. Full of personality and ticks all the right boxes for conscious tradesmanship. Some unique origin coffees to try too. A must visit when in Dublin. Absolutely delicious cup of coffee. And the service was awesome! Very friendly. Cookie was good too! Love vibes of the little spot. Customer service needs work. Coffee was good. Atmosphere was hard to judge being alone on a weekday afternoon. The coffee here is superb. Lovely location with a very relaxed atmosphere. Staff are super friendly too! Absolutely beautiful spot, went there once and so going again, the staff were do wonderful and helpful. Sadly door in is a bit of a step up, not good if you just finished leg day Food The staff here is really passioned about coffee. Ive been here a couple of times and we always have a nice chat. Its a small, charming coffee place almost hidden between the caos in Temple Bar. Besides coffee, theyve small snacks such as cakes, chocolate balls and a few sandwiches. My favourite coffee in the area! Decent little coffee shop, a regular coffee is small in my opinion, I d recommend a large. but it tasted good. Went to stock up to start my keto diet. Val is great, took the time to explain everything. Got all the ingredients and maker unit , to make the Bulletproof Coffee myself The coffee was smooth as the DeNiros and Connerys of old, hold the misogyny, and so warm as to tickle every rivet of my oesophageal canal as it made its journey through my body. The staff truly made me feel at home. The beans were slanging, the tunes banging and the atmosphere, unlike ours now tainted by human greed, was indubitably exquisite. My only regret is that I had to leave, but duty called like a child missing their father on a cold Christmas Eve. Very small place with only 12 seats but you can take away all of the seinks. They made their own coffee and its definitely excellent and the lady serving is nice. You can take coffee but they also have extra drinks like homemade smoothie. Give. It a try ! I like a small, cozy coffee shop. This is one of them. Not too loud music, not too busy, its a real treat. I recommend the Chai Latte with a cookie. Will be coming back. :) Great coffee, a welcoming atmosphere and really cool dudes at the counter. Lovely coffee, really nice atmosphere the barista is very friendly, cappuccino is very nice, good foam :). Best coffee I had so far in Dublin Had my favorite flat white in Dublin there. Great coffee and great baristas Supper great! Friendly, and tasty spot. Ice menu is available. Nice atmosphere, cappuccino is great overall. IMO just a bit milky and not hot enough, very delicate teste, thought. This cafe is perfection. Organic, house-brewed coffee, delicious mince pie, the best mulled wine Ive ever had... The cherry on top was the perfect atmosphere. We were looking for a good place to tuck away from the noise and hubbub of the city and Cocobrew delivered! Absolutely lovely! Very cosy with kind staff and wonderful food. We had a great time Rude staff. Denied me when I asked for filter coffee and then again for an aero press. Claimed they only use an espresso machine, even though it is clearly on the menu. Why waste you time here when you can go to one of the other many amazing coffee shops in the area? Great coffee and very friendly staff!! Keto lovers, reunite at Cocobrew. Although I prefer my keto coffee with grass fed butter, cocoa butter served at Cocobrew is still good option, if youre looking to have keto coffee in Dublin. Also had the chicken salad and I have to say it was yummy. Everything reasonably priced for the high quality youll get from Cocobrew. Thumbs up Excellent coffee with many gluten free options and amazing staff, Adriana prepared the best coffee! Thanks The place is cozy and clean, the waiters super nice and the carrot cake is amazing!! These guys know how to make great coffee! Wow! I was nicely impressed and defo going back there for more!! I had an amazing cappuccino with almond milk and mark my word, it was absolutely delicious! Wow The mondays are open too. A highly recommended place for a good coffe and some delicious deserts. We first came across Cocobrew & their retro VW van at the RDS wedding fair & knew we had to have it for our big day. A caffeine hit after church was a big success & the van was a beautiful backdrop for our photos, especially with their blue hydrangea on the counter. Thanks guys! The best coffee shop in Dublin with lovely staff. I will go there again once I come back to Dublin The barista is very polite. Also, the place is very clean which I am sorry to say is rare for Dublin. The customers are also polite and dont shout. Only 1 person behind the counter. Slow service. Not chatty. Moderately friendly barista. Cosy place. Good coffee. One of the rare good coffee places in central Dublin. Today I had a pleasure to enjoy cup of flat white made on Brazilian Arabica beans, both roasted and grinder here. For a flat white drink had too much foam for me. After years of enjoying coffee I still can t feel the taste of it and I think it s only draws away from the main taste. Beans were almost perfectly roasted, a bit too dark for me, I ve tasted a bit of burning coat in it and the drink was more acidic as I prefer, but not too much so I could enjoy the taste of the drink. For an Brazilian Arabica I unfortunately haven t felt any caramel or chocolate, but the drink had big body and was very soft. When the drink was running up my palate it felt like honey, not too sweet but very pleasant and calm, not even a tinge of sourness was casting a shadow on that feeling. Definitely recommend to everyone, tho keep noted that it is not a place to seat, but a place to take a takeaway coffee and enjoy the quay! #coffee Lovely little coffee shop that has a nice atmosphere. Unexpecting for being right next door to Temple Bar. Coffee is a bit pricey, but thats in comparison to chains. Super coffee and super service. Wonderful coffee shop with a great setting just off Temple Bar and the Liffey 10 secs away. Freshly ground Brazilian single origin in the hopper and super quick service. The staff know there stuff. Bad coffee, bad staff and bad place. Dont recommend. Therere lots of better Coffee Shops just around the corner. Food"
40,Coffeeangel,4.55,"Unfortunately, I cant give 6 stars. These guys are so kind. They recommended me a lot of nice places in Dublin and asked a lot about my experience here as well. Very talkative, very kind and very sweet people. And their coffee is just as amazing as they are. Definitely coming back again. Love you guys, cheers!! :) Really nice place, a little bit expensive but its worth it. Love everything in this coffee shop. A friend recommended this place and  now we know why. Its worth the visit. Their almond croissant is soooo delicious and the coffee is well prepared. Well be back soon Loved this little spot for a quick (and DELICIOUS) cup of coffee. Americano was about  3.50, but worth it. You could tell they pride themselves on their coffee brewing. Lots of coffee gear available for sale and plenty of beans to buy. Friendly service and a great little outdoor dining area with plenty of seating and some umbrellas. Just a short detour off of Grafton street. Great opportunity to take a breather from the crowds. Beautiful Coffee and definitely one of the best in Dublin, I had a cappuccino it was fantastic. The staff are really kind and watching them work was impressive everyone of them was on the ball and really attentive A++ Service guys, thankyou! Had the date bensa on individual pourover. So good. Staff were super sweet in and the cafe is cute if a little crowded but that comes with how central it is. Good choice if you are looking for a tasty cup of coffee. I like the simple coffee menu. In case you are starving you can purchase some pastries or other nibbles too. On Saturday late afternoon the pastries tasted fresh. The stuff are friendly too. One of the best around! Just be aware that the coffee blends are not that great if youre into proper Italian ones. But its not Italy so good luck finding a better place around! Best coffee in Dublin and some of the best customer service. They always have a flask of filter/batch brew ready to go so no need to wait. The one time the flask ran empty before the cup was full, they gave the coffee for free & a ticket for a free coffee next time. If youre not sure about the batch, they will give you a taster of whatevers on brew first. The beans are also the best going, ground how you like. Pog Mhilis is amazing, rich, fresh a nice fruity tone. Campobello is similar, a bit deeper but still fresh. I doubt theres a coffee here that is not delicious. Some reviews here say its a bit expensive but I disagree, its no more expensive than any other coffee shop in Dublin, but comes with consistent quality and staff expertise. Lovely place to enjoy a cup of coffee and pastries/bread while watching people passing by Coffee is good and service is great! Pan au chocolat was fair, couldnt complain I have purchased almond croissant and coffee. I really like the staff and they have heated the  almond croissant which actually enhance the flavours. I really like the coffee which was really nice. Worth visiting a new place for coffee. i learned a new word to describe food the other day with my Spanish friend: asqueroso. The latte I had is very bland and so is the matcha latte. we couldn t finish them    other than that, Service is nice! ambiente is nice ! Had been a regular for quite sometime. This place never disappoints. Great coffee and snacks that go great with it. Best coffee in the city. The menu includes batch filter, which is hard to find. Oat milk latte was exceptionally delicious. If only the place was open for a bit longer  I m sure good coffee would get enough customers in the evening. Found them via the European Coffee Trip, I had a flat white, quality beans, tasty, the milk was nearing the high limit as temperature for my taste. Good latte art. The service was pleasant and fast. The service was fast and and the staff was friendly. You get a good variety of pastries. Their latte is pretty good, and the scones were served warm with the jam and butter on the side. They also have a very nice terrace outside the coffee shop. You get a very beautiful view on an old church in the historic part ot Dublin. Their coffee is good, and I loved the cool paper cup design its a unique touch. The atmosphere is cozy, and the staff is welcoming. Great Coffee. Speciality for Real in Dublin, Ireland. Friendly & Professional staff. Outdoor & Indoor Seating. Surprisingly good coffee and croissant, given its a chain. Small seating space (arguably too small). Quick and efficient service. Food It s a little place, but it is Cousy. The staff there is super nice and the pastry there is very delicious. One of the best coffee I have ever had, perfect mouth taste and right temperature to start my morning. Cozy and warm place with lovely staff. I will definitely come back. Given the quality that Coffeeangel serves, youd never think its a chain. To be completely fair, Ive only ever been to this particular branch. They are consistent, reliable, and lets face it, experts. They really do know what theyre talking about in terms of coffee. It s really high quality, and it shows. Ive really like their batch brew/filtered coffee and their flat whites. They do change up the beans every so often, but its always a good and fun surprise. They also have quick bites (sandwiches, soups, oats, etc.), but Ive never eaten there. Whenever I m looking at the merchandise, someone always comes from around the counter to ask if I need help. When I was picking out beans, they took their time and really explained the options to me and even let me taste the roasts they had out. They re kind and always quick. Im so happy whenever I go there. Coming in here is the best part of my day. Everyone is super nice and friendly. The coffee is consistently great and the service is the fastest Ive seen. They donate to environmental organizations when you bring in a keep cup. REALLY good coffee. The coffee is really excellent. They also have these wrapped up cookies which were delicious. Theres the usual stuff on the menu and some health drinks and waters too. The staff are really friendly, without being over bearing and the choice of music there too was a nice change to the usual middle of the road dross in other places. A great little spot to chill out in. v60 was great - tasting notes clearly perceivable as promised by the barista. nice, professional service. fully recommend to coffee snobs and regular people alike Always friendly, efficient and great coffee.  Never leave without buying a warm cinnamon swirl either. Started going to coffee angels for my morning coffee only this week. Very tasty coffee and really nice staff. Expensive at 3.90 for a large Americano but thats to be somewhat expected these days This was the best coffee we have had in Dublin. It paired well with the friendliest experience we have had in Dublin as well. We had their single origin roast   Pueblo Nuevo  from Columbia as a pair over. It was delicious! We also enjoyed the selection of newspapers and old copies of Monocle that were available. Fantastic Coffee! Every time I go in here i m blown away by the coffee bean taste! Probably the best and only nice chain of coffee shops in Dublin, Staff incredibly chatty and friendly, always get you in a good mood despite not being a morning person! Great Pastry s and sandwiches on offer too! Must check back see I can I get a loyalty card! See you guys soon! Amazing coffee! Staff always friendly and kind. Highly recommended. The coffee looks very nice but the taste is was far from what I have expected as it is known for the best Dublin coffee. The taste and coffee it wasnt great I would come again. It looks like a good brand thats all. Ciao So far, the best coffee shop we went in. The coffee is amazing and even the mocca is good and easy to digest. The staff is incredibly sweet and nice. The food was awesome. I recommend the scone April 2022: Update: Made pour over filter coffee on Friday morning using the Pog Mhilis. Was very delightful (22g of coffee to 350g of water)! Was staying nearby at The Shelbourne hotel and wanted a morning coffee. Stopped by for a coffee   and some whole beans. Service was very friendly and they were very helpful to help me pick beans that I like. Coffee was very good. Will definitely be back for more great coffee. Wonderful people! We asked if he knew a bean to taste a bit less bitter and he gave us a cup of brazilian coffee for free! Amazing place, and what a view!! From the table you can see a beautiful church. I come here often and the staff are truly so nice and genuine. There s always a lovely atmosphere and the coffee is perfect! coffeeagel is my favourite coffee in town. Followed their foot print from IFSC to every where in the city. This particular shop that I usually visit on Saturdays because I always in the area. However I m not particularly impressed by the Korean looking staff in the shop, she has very strange attitude, she is super lively with the customer that she knows, but has very strange/moody attitude towards others, even regular customers that don t click with her. I have seen this happened at multiple occasions when I visited. So I will avoid visit this shop going forward. Plus the coffee tasted completely different today on 3 July when I visited, not the same anymore, had to throw half cups away. Fantastic coffee. Warm and professional staff, and let s face it, it s hard to find anywhere open to sit for a coffee at 8am. Mmmm delicious coffee!!! Thanks Im disappointed that Coffee Angel only offer oat milk as their alternative to dairy, while I am aware that its less ecologically taxing to produce as it can be done locally and it doesnt use as many resources as a result, crucially though its not going to be suitable for coeliacs. The americano I got instead was good despite suffering from coffee scum, but pricier than it was a few weeks ago, thanks to the newly increased tax and the round up added by the chain. On the plus side, I do like drink ground coffee at home and they have a great range here. The Su  Nollaig is a lovely treat in the morning (I also like the clever name of this festive blend, it means Christmas Juice in Irish) Was out for a stroll this morning and came across the coffeeangel on Ann St, saw the awards on the outside of the building and figured it would be a great cuppa. Ordered a double espresso and the locals inside were excited for me to try it. It did not disappoint! Amazing profile! Notes of grapefruit but a natural sweetness that balances the acidity. Simply Fantastic experience. The staff this morning was very friendly, I didnt catch their names,  but the three were very welcoming. Now Im sad I have to go back home Rarely been received like here. We are told where the coffee comes from etc. And it is extremely good! We were recommended to visit Coffee Angel by a friend of ours. The site wevisitedis compact and has seating inside and out. Our order for a flat white and Americano were taken quickly and served effeciently. Would visit again when in Dublin and my partner said the flat white was one of the best coffees she had tasted for quite a while. A superb atmosphere, a nice welcome and a delicious chai latte + cookie! I recommend with your eyes closed Lovely food, coffee, and staff Returned everyday of our visit to Deblin. Food Lovely friendly Staff and Great Coffee! I like the cozy vibe I love the coffe and pastries Super nice employees, very friendly and helpful to find something lactose free  . The wraps were also really good Definitely recommended. Tried their chai and it was so good. Such a nice place to have coffee and chat with your friends. Finished my breakfast so fast I didnt even have time to take a picture. I had tried everything already. Yogurts are so good although the muesli is too toasted for my taste. In any case, service is the best of all the caffeterias in town. Always trusted Santiagos recommendations and never fails. 100% recommended Excellent service . Lovely food . Very satisfied! Good coffee good food good service and good ambience. A nice place to have a good break ;) Cute little cafe, with good coffe, good choice of sandwich and pastries hot and cool. Cosy atmosphere. Good quality of coffee. Nice sitting area outside. Tasty pastries. Great place to stop and have a cappuccino. Prices are ok and the cappuccino not only is delicious but beautiful as well. Great coffee, loved our cheese and ham croussants Very kind and professional staff. Great coffee, everyone is very polite Very nice cafe with with affordable prices and pleasant staff ever since I ate some cinnamon rolls in USA, Ive been looking for similar ones in Ireland. These ones meet my expectations: juicy, soft and voluminous Consistently great coffee and the BEST customer service in Dublin is what keeps me coming back again and again. Even if there is a massive queue there is no need to worry as the team will get your sorted within 2 mins. There is always enough staff and they use their great teamworking skills to get the job done. They are also always really friendly too. Youve nailed it, well done! Finally a great place to have coffee and bites in town      price and quality at great value, opposite from everything in Dublin that usually is over priced and mostly not tasty at all... delighted with croissants, flat white and brownies. Staff are lovely and quick. Definitely coming back. Great shop and very friendly staff. Jonas and Mikial gave us latter art lessons The Chai Latte was really good, but the oat milk costs 50cent more. Thats not so vegan friendly for 2023. I would like to recommend it more... Vegetarian options: Not really vegan friendly They change you more if you seat in which I find ridiculous. The place smelled like toilet. The Wi-Fi wasn t working and 5  for a pot of tea sound be illegal. Fantastic scones and cinnamon rolls. Great coffee and nice location. It was nice to try the soup and the coffee but I feel like it was not too tasty. Maybe I should give it another chance, because the place is nice so are the people who work there. Coffee aficionados assure me that coffee good here I can certainly attest to the tea which is a rarity when you get a cup outside home. The sausage rolls are lovely and served with Ballymaloe relish and I am a big fan of the cinnamon buns. One of the best coffee in town . Perfect to take away. As well really good to meet friends. There is a range variety of coffee beans and coffee machines. Very nice staff and coffee. I sat outside and people watched. Such a great cafe. Their delivery service is incredible.  Ordered coffee beans this morning and here in time for lunch Their mixed berry scones are always delicious! The staff are lovely and its a great spot for a break away from the madness of town. Fantastic food, wonderful atmosphere and great service. Had a very nice warm scone with a hot chocolate, lovely! Staff was very sweet Highly recommand Good food for brunch. Great coffee here; delicious scones and free WiFi - requires sign in. There are a few seats outside which are bathed in the morning sunshine (if you are very lucky).  Lovely spot to relax and watch the world go by. Staff are friendly. Reasonable prices. Best coffee in Dublin, always consistent! The yogurt is unreal too. Love this place Super friendly and helpful staff and great food. The sausage roll with cider chutney was so good! Thanks for the cute latte art too! Lady coffee barista was extremely rude. The gentleman behind the counter had to excuse her. Internet didn t work. Latte was decent enough. Very lovely place and employees, we ate ham croissant, toast, bacon Bap, all is very good. I recommend this place for lunch or breakfast ! Vegetarian options: Scone, toast, almond croissant Probably the best coffee in Dublin. Prices are pretty standard for Dublin and they have a loyalty/stamp card. The staff are always friendly - not pretentious like some other Dublin coffee hot spots. Its probably not great for sitting in as spaces are white limited and seating is not the most comfortable (see Accents if thats your bag) but the coffee is so good and the atmosphere is really chilled. To be recommended. Small cafe that serves great coffee. Also serves limited edition, small batch coffees from all over the world.  So if youre interested in tasting different coffees and broadening your taste buds, this is a good cafe to go to.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and not up themselves.  They also carry a full range of coffee equipment.  Youre not going to spend the afternoon here, but a very nice 20 mins or so with a good book and really good coffee. Theres also 2 other branches in the city. Genuinely the best flat white coffee Ive ever had (will update if this changes!). Gladly a regular customer over the last five years and their coffee is always perfect. Its better coffee than Ive had in London, Edinburgh, Italy, France, Netherlands, Peru, Chicago, Washington DC, New York...etc. For sure its Dublins pride. Nice staff and tasty sausage roll A nice cup of coffee is a delightful experience. The aroma of freshly ground beans fills the air, and the rich, warm brew tantalizes your senses. With each sip, you taste a harmonious blend of flavors, from the earthy undertones to the subtle hints of caramel or chocolate, depending on the roast. The smooth, velvety texture caresses your palate, providing comfort and a gentle caffeine kick. Whether you enjoy it black, with cream and sugar, or as a fancy latte or cappuccino, a well-made coffee is a comforting and invigorating treat. I really liked the food, simple but tasty, fresh made. Efficient service and staff polite. I will definitely come back again The coffee is very nice and service outstanding! We had a single and double macciato with a very tasty berry scone! They can definitely work on the decoration and making the place a little more welcoming...a bit plain for my taste, but if you are looking for a quiet place to chill out and try a nice coffee this is the one! Lovely cafe. Peaceful atmosphere and nice staff. Great selection of freshly roasted coffee beans, I d recommend Su Beatha, a darker medium roast perfect for Italian style espressos, one of the few roasts in Dublin that s not overly light and acidic. Looking forward to try their wraps for lunch, the chicken katsu kimchi one looks delicious. We tried a couple diffrent thing here all good! The coffee wasnt too sweet, which is a nice change, and the food was nice and warm. The staff are really friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is clean and simple. A solid choice for breakfast coffee! Really nice coffee spot in the canal, staff are always really nice and welcoming! They offer big coffee mugs, which I haven t seen often around Dublin Service Ordered americano. No, the less delicious americano I have had in Dublin so far. 3 stars because of the nice scones - delicious jam (missing the clotted cream though  ). Food Such great coffee. And even when we had a slight accident with an outside table, we were brought a fresh round of coffees and vouchers for a free drink. Exceptional customer service. Highly recommended. Warm feeling. As expensive as any other coffeshop in Dublin, yes. But good and fast service. First time here, excellent staff and extremely friendly. One of the best lattes Ive had. Great coffee ... Great friendly staff ... sandwiches, soup and meal deals ... what more could you want ... its about 5 mins from connelly Station and just at the rear of the famine museum. Good oat milk cappuccino, the baristas are friendly, the inside seating is kind of bland :) but the coffee is good Terrific small americanos but definitely falling behind competitors by failing to offer Cold Brew coffee Very clean cafe. Very nice coffee and tasty scone . Pleasant staff too. Id recommend here The chai latte was the best I have ever tried. truly good. The coffee is really good. They also have a few dessert options. Very affordable. The place is clean and nice. I will repeat Great coffee. Friendly staff and quick service. That is why we come back. Very good coffee! Super cozy and great place to work and get hw done! Very nice barista as well! I got a caramel iced latte. gluten free items: some granola but other than that nothing sugar free syrups: none Really good coffee and the sausage roll was very meaty and tasty. I m not often in this part of town but totally worth it if you re around. Finally, a good coffee shop with great quality and good service I walked in 4 staff serving 2 females and 2 males. The first female asked what I would like I replied americano. The second female asked me the same question then the first male I could not understand due to the lack of English language. I paid by card and sat down. I had just put the last of my scone into my mouth and the plate was taken away. Totally bad manners. I went to this place to relax before going for an interview. It was the worst experience even the music was so loud. I will be letting the company of 5000 people where I work to avoid this place. I visited this place on 1/12/23, I was astonished by the behaviour of one of the workers (blonde Irish woman) towards one of the (I assume) new cashier, she was lecturing him and shouting at him for not registering a coffee before my order (I mean not a big deal), very unprofessional to do this in front of the clients and also to talk to the guy with such attitude! I felt embarrassed and sorry for the guy! I will not return to this place and advice my colleagues to do the same! Not a relaxing environment here! Theyve got a smooth, speedy operation for the pre-work weekday crowd, its impressive. Their porridge & croissants are great and they usually have batch brew available too which is class. Friendly service too. Despite the queue you wont be waiting long. As a lover of flat whites and cinny buns I can highly endorse this place as fine contributors to two of the worlds finest delights. The staff were super chatty and friendly too. Lovely staff! Coffee was lovely but its always the staff that leave the impression. Good coffee sells itself but the staff leave the impressions. Theres one thing about getting into the coffee angel coffee shops, their staff is so easy to recognise with the stylish clothing theyre more than happy to explain you about the coffees what they have. Casual smalltalk is also welcome as from my point of view and dont be so complicated and dont do it as I did bring the dirty keepcup Excellent service and really good coffee. Very friendly staff chilled atmosphere Lovely staff and nice coffee and sausage roll. The WiFi works great Loved the coffee here! I got a cappuccino and my partner had an americano. And, while I was there, a pigeon got inside- the staff masterfully corralled it back outside! Nice work and thanks for the coffee! Absolutely amazing staff chloe and bat I think thats  the names , I was having a bad day , I dropped the coffee by mistake and they were so nice about it and not a bother to them. They were so welcoming and friendly also the coffee was lovely. thank you so much for the lovely service I did order from this place on 10 and on 12 they asked me to leave, very rude behavior ( although the place was empty) , I am a student and this place is the closest and I visit them EVERY DAY, they ask me to leave although I did ORDER, this place disrespect their loyal customers, I WILL NEVER COME TO THIS PLACE, they don t respect their regular customers. Absolutely loved the flavoured latte (hazelnut) that I ordered. It tasted like nothing Ive had before. Nice place with very helpful and nice staff! Had a very good experience. Love the service, the guys are always so friendly and smiling that your mood changes as soon as you step in. Coffe is superb. But why your lovely soups are always spicy? Id love a classic simple chicken vegetable soup sometimes !! Please?? Thank you!! First time i had coffee from there and i have to say it was so good. Place is well designed, simple and very well made. Team is superb too. Wow, the perfect experience. Staff was friendly, SUPER fast and efficient, line moved so fast and both my sausage roll and coffee were great. Wifi too Food Love CoffeAngel, great coffee, superb service, all staff really nice and friendly, place that you want to come back to. Loved their pop out vans in the quays to get on the go coffee in the summer as well! Easily the best coffee shop chain in Dublin! They brew very tasty espresso, make fresh baked goods (the scones and home-made jam are great), and have sandwiches on offer as well. The thing that makes them stand out is their service and friendliness. The staff are always willing to give advice for coffee, share tips, and just have a chat. Would highly recommend a visit if youre nearby! I need more stars for the service. While the coffee is superb and all, the staff are what make it the best in Dublin. Passionate, knowledgeable and patient. The coffee and pastries here were very good but it was the barista who made the experience. He cared about me and how I wanted my coffee. He made me feel welcome and went out of his way to ensure I had a great experience. And finally, he was passionate about coffee. See you next time Im in Dublin!"
41,Collins Day Tours-Dublin,4.825,"I had a wonderful day in Wicklow & Kilkenny! Our tourguide Pat did such a lovely job! He s really passionate and had some really interest facts about the Irish Countryside. I recommend the tour to everyone especially with Pat and his lovely driver A! Pat the tour guide and Bart the driver were amazing. Pat was friendly, welcoming, and very informative the entire tour. He even went out of his way to chat with everyone 1:1 before the tour ended to see if we had any questions he could answer. He gave us great recommendations on other attractions in the area. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Dublin! I cannot say enough good things about Collins Day Tours! Our guide for that day was Pat, and Alec was the driver. Everything was so smooth and organized. Pat is a natural storyteller and you can tell just how much he loves and appreciates his homeland. He really knows his history. We had the perfect amount of time at Glendalough, and the drive through Wicklow National Park was beautiful. Kilkenny was a great stop as well, as the people with me were dying to visit a castle! And on top of all that, he even brought the good weather. ;) Definitely worth your day and money to book! It was a great day with tourguide Pat. He has vast knowledge of the Irish history and great stories so the ride in the coach goes by in no time. Thank you for this great trip, would highly recommend to do this for a day. I cannot stress this enough - Pat was THE BEST tour guide Ive ever had! This guy went above and beyond anything a tourist needs to enjoy a field trip. He talked about everything that may interest us without being monotone or boring. His partner was Bart, an excellent bus driver with driving skills. Huge plus is their sense of humour and warm personality. Highly recommend! Went to kilkenny  and Glendalough. A trip worthwhile. The guide, Dermot, went above and beyond. He covered the whole Irish history, the places where we stopped and anything in between. Complete package with live songs and funny episodes. I just feel the trip could be longer. Any trip with Dermot should be worth while. Our tour was with Dermot. Great guide. Very friendly and prepared to teach us about the trip and about Ireland. I apreciated the rigor with the schedules. I would totally recomend this tour and guide. Pat the tour guide was enthusiastic, funny and made the trip a blast. You can feel his love for the people and the history above all. Would take a tour from him anywhere! And Alec the bus driver was a fantastic driver. Pat was absolutely excellent! We loved his warm kindness and hilarious wit! Would recommend to everyone to hand select him as your tour guide if that was possible. Best of luck! Book the tour! Tourguide Pat ensured us with great and passionate storystelling and driver John made sure we were early at all stops. Thank you for this great trip, would highly recommend to do escape the city for a day. Great tour, a lot of interesting information and historical insights, so far the best tour experience. Thanks Pat Pat was our tour guide and Paul was our driver. Pat was simply amazing, he s like your fav grandfather with all the good stories! He s very engaging and entertaining, he made historical facts and stories interesting and easy to understand. Highly recommend coming for this day tour to learn more about Glendalough, Wicklow Mountains and Kilkenny. Everything was right on time and ran smoothly. Would absolutely recommend :) Wonderful trip! Our amusing tour guide, Brian kept us engaged thought out the day trip, with stories about the history of Ireland and all the sights we were seeing.  Hue, our driver,  was amazing. I m astonished how he can navigate this huge bus on such narrow roads. Highly recommend spending the day with them! I did the Glendalough/Kilkenny tour with Pat and Brian and honestly could not recommend them enough. Pat was one of the most genuinely kind hearted and lovely people Ive ever interacted with, he made the already wonderful trip that much better with his humor and charm. You can tell how passionate both of them were for what they do and it was very refreshing to see how proud of their countries history they were. Overall amazing experience, you will not regret booking with them, highly recommend! The Glendalough and Kilkenny tour was great! I really appreciate the narrative and the knowledge the guide had. I appreciated have just the right ratio of guided time and time to walk around on our own. It was just right, not too rushed. Pat and Alec were great! We had Collins Day Tours: Wicklow Mountains, Glendalough and Kilkenny Day Tour from Dublin. Our tour guide Pat was  friendly, knowledgeable and full of humor! Pat gave us excellent insight and tips of where to eat so five stars to him! Alec was a good driver. Bus was comfortable and every seat comes with one USB-A charging dock, however the middle door of the bus had a mechanical malfunction and kept loudly opening & closing which was quite annoying (the door of the bus needs fixing but this is not the tour guides or drivers fault.) Wicklow Mountains and Glendalough have spectacular views, a charming natural beauty and time spent there was enough. Kilkenny is a nice little town, and I believe deserves at least 1-2 more extra hour(s) to have a fuller experience. We only had 3 hours in Kilkenny which is not enough to fit more than lunch and one attraction (you can only fit  one of the following attraction after lunch: Kilkenny Castle tour, Smithwicks Experience, walking tour) I wish we had more time in Kilkenny. Overall, it was a good tour with a nice tour guide. Pat was such a great tour guide. He showed a true passion for his country and sharing it with the others on the bus. The most informative tour Ive been on and amazing places to visit. Highly recommend leaving Dublin to do the day trip to glendalough and kilkenny. It was a rainy and gloomy day but with the enthusiasm of Pat as a guide it was one of the best days of my trip to Ireland Brillant trip -  also with students. Our tour guide Pat gave detailed and interesting information. At the same time his charming and fun speeches kept us entertained. Students and teachers loved the trip! awesome. Will do it again On our first day in Ireland we got word that our previously booked trip for the next day for Wicklow and Glendalough (with a different agency) had been cancelled due to insufficient booking numbers on their end. We feared we would miss this much anticipated experience. Last minute, I scrambled to find a tour to Glendalough and we ended up on a tour the next day with Pat (tour guide) and John (driver). From check-in to arrival back in Dublin, every part of the day was wonderful. Even though it was rainy, they managed to guide us to activities we enjoyed: from nature hikes in Wicklow Nature Reserve, to historical areas of interest, to shops and attractions in Kilkenny. The drive was spectacular. Pat and John were fun, professional, kind, and helpful. Thanks for a great first full day on the Emerald Isle, Pat!! Took a day trip to Kilkenny with Collin s. Our tour guide Pat was amazing. It was the right amount of information and loved his story telling. Such a delightful tour and majorly due to the Phil and John T who were knowledgeable, professional, and fun. Highly recommend taking a day to go on this excursion, you wont regret it. And I would be amiss if I didnt mention, Phils voice is that of an angel. Dont think, just book! Our day trip to Kilkenny with Pat as our guide and Alec, the driver was fabulous. Very informative and enjoyable. Lots of good humor as well. Recommend it!!!!! I booked a last-minute excursion from Dublin to Glendalough, Wicklow and Kilkenny. I got to the bus early just to make sure I was in the right place (this was my first trip to Ireland), and Pat met me straight away and was so kind and genuine. He wanted to let me know that he was sorry for my position on the bus due to the full capacity of the tour. Ive never had this kind of upfront and frank kindness on a group tour before, and immediately I felt this was going to be a good day. I was not wrong, thats for sure. Our guide (Pat) and our driver (Alec) were incredible! Pat was an incredible story teller, with so great information about the places we traveled to, and the journey along the way. Our stops were perfect, and it was great getting away from the city and seeing a different side of Ireland. I highly recommend this tour, and I would imagine their other tours are equally enjoyable. On a side note, I had a wonderful moment in Kilkenny that was so unexpected and personal, that I dont think would have happened if not for this tour. I know it was by chance, but as Pat and I were talking about it before we left - things do seem to happen for a reason. Book a trip...I dont think youll be disappointed. Thank you for the memories, Pat and Alec!!! We took a group of 46 students and 4 teachers from and to the Dublin airport. Our driver, Andrew, was extremely nice and very punctual on both occasions. The  bus was extremely comfortable and, the best for a group of teenagers... was the USB chargers available above each seat. A fabulous day touring Glendalough, Wicklow and Kilkenny!  Pat, the brilliant tour guide was so knowledgeable and he really put a great deal of effort into make our trip enjoyable! Thoroughly recommend Collins Day tours, comfortable, well organised and a great way to see Dublin and learn about the Irish history. Great day in the Wicklow Mountains Park and Kilkenny. Our guide Hugh was great, a real enthusiast, and very friendly. Throughout the journey he spoke to us to explain the landscapes, Irish culture Much of the information was good about the sites but our guide talked nonstop interjecting his political views. Also treated the tourists like a bunch of his school children. Kept going on and on about promptness and talking while he was talking. One correction or very brief discussion is enough! He has no idea what people might have to deal while traveling. He begged for tips and 5 star reviews a multitude of times. Fantastic touring guide to have in your journey. I really loved the experience and Pat and John are an amazing duo. Good Job and thank you for everything. Short of words for how lovely our tour was. Pat is truly an amazing guide. Weve never witnessed somebody so warm, passionate & cheerful towards their guests. He made every moment of our tour worthwhile. Our driver John was equally welcoming too. Totally had the greatest of the experience. Would recommend to everyone. Such a perfect day! The bus was always perfectly on time, our driver (sir) alec was fast and safe and our guide pat was such a enrichment! super friendly, always up for a little chat and good information, always with a little irish humor :). I can clearly say this was already one of my fav days 2024 thanks to these two! Will recommend to every friend planning an Ireland trip. Its so worth it!! Everything about this tour has been an unforgettable experience. Pat the tour guide was very knowledgeable, charismatic and had some good jokes along the way. He went above and beyond to make sure we were getting the information we needed and kept us all engaged with the way he was speaking. He went out of his way to have a chat with all on board and learn our names and stories, which was nice because it made it more personal instead of feeling like a passenger. Our bus driver Paul, was very nice and also took an interest in getting to know the people on board. He is a great driver and I felt very safe the whole way through. I can not recommend these two enough and the tour itself is definitely worth doing. I have had the most amazing trip with Pat his storytelling is spectacular and truly made it a magical experience. I will book more tours with Collins day tours because of him. He is so informative and has such a great way with people. We did the Glendalough, Wicklow, and Kilkenny with Pat and Alec. Had a great time and would recommend. Great sites and great tour guide. Policy more important than morals and ethics. My wife and I were booked on the Wicklow Mountains, Glendalough & Kilkenny Tour however we were unable to attend because my wife is pregnant and started being ill in the early hours of the morning. I reached out to Collins tours later that day to request a refund and they essentially said they dont care that my wife was sick and I was looking after her, we didnt give 24 hours notice, so arent going to refund us. With all due respect, its impossible to cancel 24 hours before the tour if my wife is sick at the time we were supposed to meet for the coach. Said they were unable to sell the tickets to someone else because we didnt give notice. Theyre essentially saying they dont care that your wife was sick and you were looking after her, policy says we dont have to refund you so we wont. Shows they care more about their bottom line than the health of a pregnant woman. Lack of empathy, morals and ethics. Book with another company instead of enriching this company. Patt was an amazing guide actually one of the best I have ever met. John the driver drived carefully and was polite too. The price for the trip to Wicklow mountains and Kilkenny was ok . We made the tour to Kilkenny through the mountains from the wicklow national park with the guide pat who is a lovely man with amazing communication skills and the driver John. Really a pretty good day. Pat was amazing if I could give him 11/10 I would. Hugh was a super safe driver who got us there in a timely manner. I would recommend them 100%, loved the tour. Lifelong memories were made Wonderful day and a brilliant trip by Collins Day tours by Mr. Brian and Mr. Phillip. Thank you for giving us so much of information, for being so inclusive, patient, explaining the history and background so well, for making sure we had a good time. You gave us a very good experience of the history of Ireland, its architecture and a lot of other things. Me and my friends definitely had a great time thanks to all of you. The bus is very clean, theyre very punctual, driving is excellent and very, very safe. We would highly recommend them to everyone. Thank you very much once again. Pat and Alec were absolutely terrific. Definitely recommend the daytrip to Kilkenny! Worth every penny and lots of fun We did the Wickalow Mountains, Glendalough, and Kilkenny Day Tour from Dublin. Pat was our tour guide and did an awesome job taking care of the group. I enjoyed all of the history I learned about these places. Bus tours are a great way to see a lot and I would highly recommend to others. Thank you!"
42,Container Coffee,4.95,"Great coffee, friendly staff, cool vibe & location, and delicious sausage rolls. Perfect for a visit before or after the guinness factory or if youre just nearby. Really nice place close to the Guinness storehouse. Great coffee but even better bites! The vegetarian quiche was delicious and everyone loved their fennel roll as well. They have a really nice outdoor sitting area as well. The best container coffee in Dublin. My cappuccino decaf with oat milk was very good. The team is very friendly too. Went to the flea market today at the Digital Hub and got a caramel macchiato latte and a carrot cake and were both so good, fair prices and the selection is really good, I had a hard time deciding what to get! The staff is nice and there s plenty of space outside to seat and enjoy your coffee. Have to return again soon and try their famous sausage rolls! My favourite coffee shop for the past 3 years! Always very welcoming and friendly. Such a lovely community vibe in there, and they really try to get to know the customers and welcome them warmly again! Best coffee around, I ve brought many friends there who all agree! They do lovely sandwiches and treats aswell Amazing coffee, sandwiches and treats. Always worth a stop when on Thomas Street. Its takeaway with a load of seating out the back in an old part of Dublin with loads of history from the Whiskey distillery. Theres an old mill and a pear tree more than 100 years old. Beautiful in flower but the fruit is more suited to jams than eating. Anytime Im near I stop for coffee. Lovely coffee stop in Dublin. The brownies are delicious - too delicious   I go back for the coffee and the brownies. Friendly staff. The seating area outside is also worth a visit, lovely zen zone in the middle of the city. Best place to go for coffee in the city centre. Gordon and his staff are a pleasure to deal with. Always a lovely atmosphere in the cafe. They make the smoothest coffee, cappuccino is my go to but I d also recommend their mocha, Chipotle chicken toastie and their sausage roll with pear and black pudding. They ve a lovely outside seating area also which is a decent size, have never had trouble getting a seat with how many there are Great staff, very welcoming from the moment you step in. Loved the suggestive, rather than the common pushy, upelling for some lovely additions to what was going to be just a quick coffee. Definitely try the chunky cookies. And of course the coffee was a smooth hot kick-start to the day! Really nice place to grab a coffee. Especially when the weather is nice, you can sit outside while you enjoy their delicious coffee. I highly recommend paying this place a visit! Not out of this world, but it is a cute coffee shop that is worth a visit if youre nearby.  I liked my coffee from here, and would stop in again if I was in the neighborhood again. Some of the best coffee in Dublin. Used to go here almost every day when I worked in the area. It s been a while and I miss it. Food is lovely too. Get two sausage rolls, they re amazing. I have to say, that in all 4 days that we have been in Dublin this is a place that had the most delicious coffee! And we drink a lot of coffee and we are all very picky about it. Recommend it for sure!!! Food Really great quality barista coffee.  Food is decent too. They also give a discount when you bring your own cup! Excellent Always great coffee and delish sausage rolls, at the Digital Hub. Plus some of the best outdoor seating in town  on a nice day. If the hub also hosts a market that day, youre all sorted, nothing else needed in life. Fantastic spot for a delicious Coffee & Vegetarian Pie! Really great seating area outside and super friendly staff that make great coffees!!   We also had a tasty Chicken & Vegetarian Pie in the sun Read a review of this cafe and went out of my way to try it, I wasnt disapointed. The staff are very friendly. The hot chocolate is amazing. They have a limited but very nice selection of cakes including a vegan option. They have a good range of sandwiches. The outdoor seating area at the back of the container is relaxed and colourful but weather dependant. I will definately come back again. Simple container space with a little hidden cute outdoor space at the back. Gorgeous coffee, made well  and variety of home made, high quality sausage rolls. The black pudding and pear flavour was the best. A wonderful place. Food is fresh and tasty. The staff are really friendly. They ve got indoor and outdoor seating too which is great on sunny days. And the music is always top notch too Wheelchair accessibility: Ramp out front. A lovely little spot with benches where you can enjoy your cuppa. Unfortunately it was a rainy morning when I went and didn t get to stay. I ordered for turmeric latte but was not available, would definitely go back for it when it will be available! However their flat white was great! My friend ordered Belgian hot chocolate and was inlove with it! Would love to see the baristas bring out some smiles in their faces though! I love the morning chats with the baristas and their enthusiasm with coffee. Nevertheless, coffee was lovely. I went to the one in Thomas Street, lovely spot with a lovely view of St. Patrick s tower. Fast forward to a week later, I went back on a sunny morning and had their Hazelnut Oat Latte   It was delicious, perfect for sweet tooth! It was a nice blend! Definitely would go back here. They use cloudpicker coffee beans which is also a plus! Great service, delicious food, and an interesting outdoor seating area near Guinness Vegetarian options: Vegetarian sausage rolls are available, plus porridge and other options The coffee, pastries and vegan sausage roll were all really good. The Belgian hot chocolate was really good too. Vegetarian options: There are a few vegetarian options. Favorite coffee shop on my way to work! Always friendly, always great coffee and the most amazing peanut butter flapjacks ever Coffee is good, not the best but definitely not the worse, staff friendly and nice area outside away from traffic Pricey for what you get however but think every is nowadays Food Nicest local sourced food and treats with the best coffee. Staff are all lovely! My go to coffee place always    coffee & sausage rolls are amazing wouldnt go anywhere else     the staff are always so lovely & welcoming x The bestest coffee and baristas in Dublin! Every trip to Container brightens my day and the staff are so kind & lovely. The best sausage rolls Ive ever had. I highly recommend giving them a try! Fabulous little cafe with exotic staff. Loved it here. Carrot cake was absolutely delicious. I bought another to take home. My view from the outside area very nice too. Great small cafe with lots of options for varying diets including vegan. It has a nice view of St. Patricks Tower. Stopped by during a stroll to the Guinness Storehouse. Coffee is OK. Great garden by old Roe mill - perfect on a sunny day Really nice coffee in a fun environment. The sausage rolls were nice and it was good to see a solid recycling scheme in place for the cups, plates and utensils. Take a unique concept, add in Quality latte and a very interesting turmeric latte (which we tried).. Top it all off w a nice view of St Patricks tower.. That makes container Coffee a top-notch experience for one and all! Picturesque spot, perfect for hot sunny days when you can just enjoy the warmth with a cup of coffee in your hand (the day of my visit was supposed to be such warm day, but I got to enjoy Dublin weather at its best instead haha) Best coffee in D8! Won t go anywhere else, staff is so chatty and friendly love going in. Food My number 1 spot for coffee and little snack, can t beat the atmosphere in the place & friendly staff! Not to mention the great seating area that s available. Top class coffee Top class service Always served with a chat and a smile. Best around the area Food : 5/5 | Amazing coffee! I m from Melbourne and it tastes like home - so happy to have found this gem in Ireland! Beautiful, friendly staff. Awesome vibes. Can t wait to return! xx The staff are lovely and the coffee is great. Always a great experience."
43,Copper + Straw Speciality Coffee,4.575,"I went in today with my girlfriend for a coffee, wanted to try something different, so we both ordered: Red Velvet Late (I Hope I wrote the name correctly): Presentation 10/10, taste: 7/10, when you look at the coffee glass by its appearance your mind is telling you before even tasting thats gonna probably have a vibrant taste but for us at least it was nothing special, the specific product has a little different texture you can feel very small grains/powder in the drink, my girlfriend was not a big fan of that while I dont minded... Now I am not sure if was specified somewhere that the texture is a little different or not. Overall: The place is very clean, I like the specific style, the staff was very friendly, and probably their classic coffee range is good as the place is very busy ... Yes is a nice place to drink your coffee in Dublin Copper and Straw Coffee Shop in Dublin is a true gem! Their hot chocolate and chai lattes are simply divine, offering a cozy indulgence on chilly days. But their menu goes beyond just beverages   theres something for everyone. From freshly brewed coffee to delectable pastries and hearty sandwiches, Copper and Straw has it all. The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it the perfect spot to catch up with friends or enjoy a quiet moment alone. The staff are friendly and attentive, adding to the overall welcoming atmosphere. Whether youre in the mood for a comforting hot drink or a satisfying bite to eat, Copper and Straw delivers. Its definitely become my go-to spot in Dublin, and I cant recommend it highly enough! Vegetarian options: Vegetarian sausage roll options available Copper + Straw on Aston Quay is a little gem in the heart of Dublin City. As soon as I walked in the door I felt hugged by the lively, warm and cosy atmosphere. I usually can t resist the amazing sausage rolls but this time I had a delicious almond croissant with a top quality cappuccino Copper + Straw really are the coffee specialists and you can feel the passion and dedication they infuse into everything they do. The staff are exceptionally attentive and friendly which contributes enormously to the ambience. I highly recommended a visit here or to one of their other equally excellent locations on Aston quay or in Bray. Nice cafe in the heart of Dublin. I tried their carrot cake and the chai latte. Carrot cake was absolutely amazing and the chai latte was good too. As for the food:The coffee didnt match the flavour titled the black forest the most and was overpowered by the relish you could barely taste the pesto or the cheese there was a hint of their flavour but the flavour of the relish was too strong, I would say the cheese was very good and stretching test passed.  The bread texture is perfect, but missing some flavour a bit of extra garlic on the bread while toasting it would make it better instead of overpowering ralish.  If you choose to get this sandwich unless they change the relish, dont waste your money.  Coffee, choose any other flavour. Coffee is great by itself but lacks the flavour mentioned. As for the service very young energetic and fast-paced service from whats offered on the menu, and very genuinely helpful when there seem to be queries related to anything service-related, atmosphere: young crowd mostly and very loud if you are there to talk with someone and hear each other since the place is very packed and small. If you dont speak loudly you wont hear each other well. Ordered the Iced Mexican Mocha and the Red Velvet latte from their summer speciality menu... Unfortunately, underwhelming to the most. Very basic flavours; the Mexican Mocha still had a unique presentation, the red velvet completely lacked that. Taste wise, I did enjoy the cinnamon-y, slight heat from the Mexican Mocha. The red velvet tasted just like a regular iced latte, with few flowers for presentation. Atmosphere wise it was quite chill, vibes, nice music, good buzz in the shop, but 2/10 in the overall experience. As a coffee snob from Costa Rica who s been traveling for the last 4 months, I have to say, this is the best coffee I ve had since I left! The sausage roll was also incredible! The cafe is cozy and cute and the service was lovely. It s expensive  but this is Dublin Definitely recommended! Very tasty sausage roll! The leak and sage roll was delicious and the perfect serving size. They have a nice selection of lose leaf teas. Everything of very reasonably priced, especially for the location and the high quality food. They have nice background music that is at the perfect volume so its not annoying. Ill probably be returning next time Im in the area. 10/10, would recommend! Wheelchair accessibility: There is a ramp in and the aisle to the till is nice and wide. Seats would have to be moved to make room for dine in, but that looks very possible and I dont think it would make the space too tight. Arguably the best specialty coffee shop in town. Got for origins/varieties of SOE beans to choose from. Nice latte art and welcoming staff. Highly recommended if you care about your coffee rather than caffeine! I am not a coffee drinker but I could not enjoy their coffee enough. The Butterscotch Latte is the best thing I have ever tried. Great staff and location also Editing this review couple of months later. Their matcha is out of this world Staff as kind as always The place is really nice but the pastry s needs to improve because they re a bit gummy and difficult to eat (I come from Italy and I am used to a softer and leavened products). Unfortunately also the espresso I took was really burnt that I left it. The staff was really kind! A very welcoming small coffee shop which is a pleasant change. Friendly staff and the coffee was great, nice flavour and no bitterness. Yesterday for a break from the rain, I found myself in Copper drinking a delicious red velvet latte. And after a good long morning, I found myself walking .5 km out of the way to have another. Every employee has been great and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. Would definitely recommend. I was expecting fresh food after seeing  one of the best 10 coffees in Dublin Also 3,5  for an old/not fresh croissant. You can get a fresh croissant in any grocery store for 1 Our bill: 30  and it doesn t worth Food : 3/5 | I came here three times this week while I was visiting Dublin.  It was amazing each time.  Just the right atmosphere - the coffee was brilliant and the staff were very nice and a pleasure to deal with.  I wish all coffee places in Dublin were like this one- a gem located right on the Liffey! Thank you- I will be back Dietary restrictions: Every item clearly numbered with the allergen chart Good drinks, yummy pastries, and friendly service! Got a pain au chocolat and an iced matcha. The pain au chocolat was very good and the matcha was a little milky but still super delicious. Decent cappuccino, nothing special, but expensive for the regular size and to go. Also, the service is very slow and they charge you  0.5 extra for oat milk, one of the most popular milks in Ireland... so disappointing :( I loved the place and atmosphere. My coffee was excellent but my croissant was cold af. I found this cafe as it was recommended for places to work but they dont even have WiFi. Also as I was working I had to go and refill my water etc as it is self service. I would love a place were I would have been taking better care as I was occupied in meetings etc all morning. Tried iced latte with coconut milk and it was SO GOOD, also tried flat white and it was SUPER PUPER DUPER !The design is really nice and cozy!The bathroom is big and cool as you can see on the photo.Overall really liked the cafe 10/10 First place we visited since getting to Dublin on our weekend break away. 1st class coffee. Highly recommended I just had a latte and asked for their homemade butterscotch syrup as well (thanks, Google reviews !) : its AMAZING. Please go have one !! Best coffee I ever had in my life. Their home-made butterscotch syrup is amazing. A little bit on the pricy side but very worth it for the quality and flavour. Staff was very friendly & knowledgeable and they helped me choose coffee beans that matched my preferences. One of the best matcha lattes I ve ever had. Solid vibe inside and very kind staff. Fantastic coffee! Nicely decorated place. Busy and not a lot of available seating if wanting to sit in One of Dublins superb specialty coffee spots. As a fan of filter/pourover it didnt disappoint. I love the red velvet latte   tastes like a cake but not that sweet and it s still the strong coffee I love   thank you for the experience Really nice cafe in central Dublin. Has a good selection of at home coffee items (beans, grinder, aeropress, filters etc) and some nice pastries. Really nice interior concrete theme. Minimal and very clean bathroom. Great music and small place to work but closes at 4pm I ve been in this place for breakfast two times when I was in Dublin and I have to say that is a very calm place, the people that works there are so kind. Beautiful place and good food and coffee! AMAZING FOOD, GREAT SERVICE AND A NICE COFFEE! The pulled pork sandwich is one of the best I ve ever had! The staff are very friendly here I would definitely recommend this place good coffee! i saw everyone rave about this place and while the coffee was really good, their choice of pastry s and things to eat was a bit underwhelming. good place if you want good coffee, but not so much if you re looking for a quick bite! Excellent coffee and fantastic service from friendly engaging and completely genuine staff. Thankyou Steve and the crew at Copper + Straw for creating a welcoming and positive experience! Great spot to catch up over coffee with friends or work solo. Limited but quality selection of pastries and nibbles to accompany consistently great coffee. Easily my favourite cafe in Dublin! Absolutely delicious coffee! The best I ve found in Dublin so far. The pain au chocolat was fine, but nothing special. It did the job for breakfast. Excellent coffee spot! Dublin is full of coffee shops, few of them offer real artisan coffee. This is one that really stands out from the crowd. Fantastic coffee, super friendly service. Also offer guest roasts and retail coffee beans. If you enjoy really good coffee, make sure to visit! A great coffee spot in central Dublin, right on the riverside. Lots of choice including filter and espresso-based drinks. The oat flat whites we had (on more than one occasion) were really good The drinks were amazing! Tasty and beautiful!! The people working were very friendly. The atmosphere was cozy and clean, I could ve sat here all day:) We have been travelling for 5 x weeks, and Ireland is our 8th country. Without a doubt, this was the best coffee weve had. Superb! nice presentation but the cappuccino was not pleasant and was very disappointed. It cost  4 which is high enough for a small cup of cappuccino. The place is nice and calm and staff are nice. Cool atmospheric place! Smiling faces, comfortable mugs, delicious pastries (almond croissant and cinnamon danish), leaf tea and coffee - everything 5 stars;)) Lovely little coffee shop, glad I did a quick TripAdvisor search! Very nice coffee, cookie, and atmosphere. I like that my cappuccino is nicely warm. At many places, it s not warm enough so it was a pleasant surprise to me. Also they have various gluten free dessert options! Top notch specialty third wave coffee here in Dublin. I tried both the flat white as well as the Ethiopian espresso and they were both perfectly made. On the flat white the microfoam was just right & allowed them to make a great tulip in both drinks, and for espresso they have 3 different blends/origins to choose from which is pretty unique. The Ethiopian I had was really well dialed in; you could tell they know what theyre doing here. I usually don t give bad reviews but I can t give this place more than 2 stars for my first visit here. I ordered the red velvet iced latte and for  5.50 ( 6 with almond milk), the drink wasn t that great. Not just the fact that it wasn t to my tastes flavour-wise, but the drink was quite powdery so it was unpleasant to drink The service was not very great either. I opted to sit in so I sat down at a free table whilst waiting for my drink. As you can see in the photo, the table was quite dirty from the previous customer. The server handed me my drink on the table without cleaning the table for me which I was a bit disappointed about and made me not want to stay for very long. I can recognise the potential of this place as there are really good reviews so perhaps I just went in on a bad day but this was just my experience anyway. Located on the corner next to the river, this cafe takes coffee very seriously. They allow more of a specialist flavour than most cafes in Dublin. Also, they sell socks and t-shirts with their branding, which demonstrates how proud they are of their fine product. In addition, there is a wall of coffee accessories to satisfy the pickiest of tongues. The view is great for watching the world while away or reading a book as these massive windows bathe the whole place in lashings of sunlight. I recommend the Leek + Sage roll or Red Pepper + for Veggies. Vegetarian options: There are limited vegetarian options. We came here 2 times while we stayed in Ireland for couple of days, one of the best coffee I ever tried, loved the butter scotch latte. Service is good also. A pretty cute spot. I went through the other reviews on this one and one person was upset about not getting served right away right as it opened. As someone who has worked in service roles, Id say our experience went perfecly. We had no problems with that. The food and drinks were pretty good. They had water cups available which was lovely. The music was nice. Overall, just a pleasant time here. Some say this coffee is overpriced but I feel like coffee shops like this always charge a bit. I think thats how they stay afloat. Im glad we have other options to go to outside of Starbucks. Cheers from Denver! Bella Au literally cross the street and get the same stuff 1 to 3  cheaper (hot chocolate 1.5  against 4.5 , 2.5 kids version). Camping ahh chairs, stone sofa (with plugs though) the interior looks good beside the floor and the area behind the counter. So much could be improved if there was the will. Maybe the coffee is better quality here though I wouldnt know. This was a lovely little Cafe! I really enjoyed my experience here. The sausages rolls were amazing. The Sausage and Leek roll was out of this world. I cant say I have had a better one, than the one I had here. It was wonderfully flaky, buttery, and the perfect amount of savory. The coffee selection here is also quite good. I also ordered the Vietnamese Coffee and the Mexican Mocha. Although I wasnt a fan of this particular Vietnamese coffee (I am from the states and I grew up in Little Vietnam in Houston, I know Vietnamese coffee very well) the Mexican Mocha was extremely delicious. It was even served with a small Chili pepper on top to let one know of the added spice. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They provided solid recommendations and the venue was top notch.  Very clean and welcoming. There was also a very easy-to-use ordering system to grab a coffee and go. Perfect for the busy schedule in Dublin. I would stop at this business again. I enjoyed myself here. I would also recommend to others to make it a point to stop here and enjoy a coffee. I gave me just the pick me up I needed prior to my Jameson tour. Cheers Copper+Straw! Very good atmospere with amazing choice of quality coffee with original special offers and very friendly service. I highly recommend. Very unique coffee drinks. It was fun to experience something so quirky and unusual. Lovely little coffee place that serves pourover coffee, as well as a delicious chai. Very chill and welcoming atmosphere. The taste of your coffee was truly wonderful! The French toast with its crispy exterior and soft interior was a delight. The Americano was perfectly balanced and its rich flavor left me mesmerized. Thank you for providing such a fantastic coffee experience! Is a good choice for best coffee and lovely cozy bakery You can drink your cup of coffee with the sunlight I highly recommend the place I visited on a Tuesday morning. The atmosphere was exactly what you want for a morning coffee. The baristas were very nice and patient. The coffee was fantastic and I would highly recommend an almond croissant. Perfect way to start the day, would 100% recommend! Grabbed a couple of coffees for takeaway while eyeing the food. Wished we wouldve stayed in for a second round and snacks because the coffee was incredible! Veggie options available. Incredible coffee and toasties. Staff are always really lovely to deal with! Great selection of guest coffees, something new to try every week We stopped for a coffee and pastry.  The coffee was fine,  not bad, not fabulous.  I had a muffin which again was grand, hubby had a little pastry which he said was nice. They didnt have a big selection, and it was early enough,  around 10.30am when we were there. Its not a cosy spot,  its very industrial,  I wouldnt thinks the kind of place you would sit for too long.  The staff were friendly. Barista here. Beautiful experience. Specialty coffee. Double espresso shots in all lattes. Gibraltar was good. Really wonderful experience to dine in or get a coffee to go. 5/5 Espresso perfection!   Good & rich selection. Unfortunately pastries are only OK. Perfect and top quality coffee, friendly staff and great atmosphere. I tried many coffee shop at Dublin. Ive like to say Copper and Straw is one of the best coffee shop at the town. Such a lovely cafe, and the seasonal coffees were delicious! Nice chilled atmosphere and the barista was really nice! Starbucks attitude and prices! I was visiting Dublin and found this spot from google maps. I love my Sunday mornings coffee. As I was staying a bit further out I decided to run in time for Sunday am opening (9am). I was early and I waited outside as it was close to opening. The girl with ink (tattoo) opened up on the dot and greeting me politely and I decided to order inside as my hands were cold (-5 apparently!). The (blonde) girl at the counter addressed me and took my order: americano with hot oat milk, she asked if I wanted anything else, I eventually decided on a plain croissant. Before I even had the chance to sit down and fix myself up I was greeted with:  You pay now! This was extremely aggressive. And I was disappointed from then on. I was literally frozen and this attitude was unacceptable. The coffee itself was great, no doubt about it. The croissant was stale, furthermore was not offered to be warmed up. I drank my beverage and ate my croissant and left by taking my cup and plate to the counter. One star for the polite girl who acknowledged me. One star for the coffee. One star for the warmth inside. Two stars deducted for being treated as a some form of criminal and poor pastry. A very sour taste when I left! For my first visit here I had a lovely raspberry and almond bakewell with an oat milk flat white. After reading the other reviews I tried the coffee before adding any sugar, and Im glad I did. Really nice Espresso must need less sugar, and this coffee needed none; it just paired beautifully with the sweet tart. Also the staff are very friendly, and it was a pleasantly bustling cafe on a sunny Saturday morning, with a view out onto a bridge over the Liffey. Ill definitely be back to Copper + Straw. My favourite place for a really good speciality coffee and a freshly baked pastry, sweet or savoury when in Dublin. Warm Almond croissant highly recommended. Good selection of pastries and toasties etc. Service excellent and the  guys serving always very friendly. Friendly staff, and good food. I had a sausage roll and my friend had a croissant - both were good! I can say that it is one of the most beautiful cafes you can find in Ireland. A very enjoyable experience with its location and taste, highly recommended! Staffs are really nice and kind! Lovely coffee and Cajun chicken toastie. Staff are friendly too so everything was perfect! Food Best coffee we had during our stay in Dublin. Perfect balance of acidity and smoothness in the espresso that most coffee shops fail to understand. Staff is very friendly as well. Lovely little place for a very quick bite, excellent coffee and friendly staff best coffee i had in irelandd, their cortado is so similar to cappucin in tunisia .string coffee taste which i liked Coffee is so delicious. And every barista is very kind. It was my first visit in Ireland. Great Coffee. Lovely Baristas, chatty but not over the top! Vibe is perfect! Have become a regular!! Fantastic coffee and a good selection of small snacks. The place is very clean, bright and inviting. We stayed here for a short break and enjoyed it a lot. Really nice    lovely coffee (I had a filter) and the food was great too, v friendly! Only had coffee in this place but it was a good experience. The staff is friendly and the coffees are good. Absolutely excellent. Best coffee and ham sandwich   that have tasted in ages. Well done. Best coffee in Dublin! I tried many places in the past year since I moved to Dublin and I can say this place is the best in quality, friendly staff and lovely deco. My mornings arent the same without it. Awesome little cashew nut chocolate cakes, and of course the coffee is on point. Wonderful little cafe with a bit of atmosphere from the passing crowd Just landed in Dublin from the US and needed a cappuccino. This Cafe was perfect. Great coffee and service."
44,Costa,3.375,"One of the best Costa outlets Ive ever visited. Very strategically located and well designed. If youre in the area, stop by and check out their extensive menu. Perfect spot for a cozy break after a good walk. I ordered a banana cake along with a Hot Mocha topped with extra marshmallows and chocolate, a delightful and tasty combination that I highly recommend. A wonderful cafe right near Trinity College, Costa Coffee Dawson was a place to rest for a bit before adventuring more into the city. A great short stop if you need a break and some amazing coffee too! Highly recommend for people who are looking for a chill place to relax! Quick meal with a pal. It could be more difficult to find a table because of the impressive setting. Coffee is typical for this type of establishment. It was a tasty cake. Here, we had a terrific time. The bill seemed a little on the pricier side. It is inside an old building, has plenty of seating and a cosy environment. The coffee wasn t the best but was reasonably good. The best thing was that they had too many cake and snack options and they all looked so tempting and delicious.. I would absolutely come back for having some cake Nice coffee shop and good food options  . Their pasta is delicious and hot chocolate is a must try. They have seating at basement also. Location is great it is next to grafton street and near luas and bus stop. Today I went and  asked could the cheese be removed  from sandwich and toasted ?Staff said that cant be done. Then at the counter to get coffee a male staff member  flung the tray down with sandwiches on the counter! Dietary restrictions: Not great Wheelchair accessibility: Not great Totally average Costa, food drink and service as expected, however the store is completely inaccessible for wheelchairs and others with mobility issues. The one ramped entrance is blocked by a very heavy manual door and there is not much wheelchair accessible floor space. Wheelchair accessibility: There is an accessibility ramp around one side of the building, however the door is very heavy and not automatic so it is impossible to enter without someone to help open the door Downstairs is often closed but when it s open it s such a good place to sit down in town. Comfortable couches. Open space. No phone signal though. I ordered a medium-sized iced mocha with extra whipped cream here. But when I checked my receipt, I found that there was a small mistake I asked the staff right away, and they refunded it very kindly. Also, when I got my order, I got a small-sized iced mocha without whipped cream but they made my drink again immediately! It was a very busy time, so I understand that they can make a few mistakes. But their service was very nice! Thank you so much. Coffee is fine and the staff are pleasant. Lacks plugs and reliable wifi for working on laptop however, and the bathrooms tend to be dirty. I wish this beautiful interior would be used for a better purpose than this capitalist monstrosity. I was also very disappointed with the service - even tho I was staying, I got my tea in a to-go paper cup (unnecessary waste) and they put milk in it before the tea could brew :( Good atmosphere, great coffee, terrible wifi, I tried to connect my laptop to the network for a good half hour and when it finally connected the Internet was painfully slow. Also terrible service, I wanted to use the toilet but since I didnt had my receipt they refused to give me the code I dont know why you do that it just makes you look stupid and greedy. Overall horrible experience from a place I used to love. Only gave 3* as we wanted toast for breakfast and this Costa does not provide this option. Disappointed as wed deliberately chosen to go there over Cafe Nero and Starbucks. Very kind service but the wifi is so bad, low signal, not recommended for digital nomads Situated in an impressive, beautiful building, this Costs is special. A short walk from Kilkenny design & on route to the National Art Gallery, its a quiet Haven for a cup of coffee & snack in a old world design, almost like a gentlemans club. Comfy armchairs & plenty of private space, make sure to check out downstairs. It has an atmosphere all if its own, everyone chills and relaxes in this generous space, a hidden gem if you want to get some quiet time on your computer or just read. Live the place ! I went today at Costa with my 5 year old son, he had to go to the bathroom. We were told that we need the code on the receipt. Not cool, but whatever  not so angry at this point. No other place around with a toilet, so we go back to Costa to get a babyccino and take him to the toilet. The line for the till is long, so I ask the employee at the counter if I take my five years old boy to the bathroom and then I ll get a babyccino. I am told to do the queue. I reply  are you serious? I m with a little kid. He says, we follow the rules . We leave. I ll let you predict what happened, on a cold day in Dublin City center, not fun. Now I m appalled: is the Costa rule book so strict to prevent staff to let kids to go their toilets? Or is the Costa staff trained to be rude? I like the Costa coffee, and I used to go there quite a lot. But after this, they will never see me or my family and hopefully any people i know anymore. Staff are lovely and polite, great atmosphere, good food, nice reliable positive experience! Location in city is perfect and close to transport. Ideal stop before or after a visit to Trinity College and The Book of Kells. Caramel Macchiato and Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake were delicious Food Amazing Coffee! the mocha is out of this world. The Nassau st Costa building has an Iconic feel with plenty of room downstairs, suits if you want some peace and quite while enjoying your coffee. The staff always check on you and are good craic! great coffee and super cozy place, staff is always friendly and helpful and very quick too which I appreciate a lot! 10/10! Great selection of different coffees and drinks and lots of pastries/cakes, too. Took only few mins to get my coffee. Very good hot chocolate and Chai latte! In a calm and comfortable atmosphere. I am so shocked and still can t believe it! Such an unfriendly employee (feminin, short brown hair & Dr. martens)  I had to go to the toilet really urgently and wanted to buy myself a coffee afterwards. But they do have a strict policy: Buy first and then use the toilet! Not a problem in itself, but the way she said it didnt work at all! Suuuuper unfriendly - worst coffee experience in Dublin. Never ever again and definitely not recommended The building and interior are beautiful and staff was friendly and quick, but I admittedly wasnt overly enthused about my coffee. Ill definitely be coming back to try something new though! Lovely surroundings in a +100 year former bank with original decor. Its my favourite coffee shop of all in the city centre and lovely place to sit and do some work.  Theres also free WiFi provided by bitbuzz and If you take a loyalty card, your internet usage is time unlimited (20 mins for non-loyalty card users). The downstairs area can feel a bit neglected and is often frequented by groups of students and can be quite rowdy so I prefer to take a seat on the ground floor. It also has proper spacious toilets, though youll need an access code which can be found on your receipt. Extremely disappointed with Costa, will never EVER go back in the place!!! My 7y old was bursting to go for a wee and they didn t let him use the toilet unless I bought something, I am the opposite of a cheap skate but imagine having to buy something just to let a child use the toilet!!!! You should be ashamed of yourselves, really should!!! A very impressive looking building, Ive never been to such a fancy looking coffee shop. Its very pristine. The coffee is good, but a little pricey. Theres not many places to sit either. Coffee was good. After you get your coffee you go to find a table and people are hogging tables with laptops doing their daily tasks and no intention of moving. One person would occupy larger tables making it difficult to find somewhere to sit or ask to share. Tables that werent in laptop use ALL had dirty dishes with no one clearing except the customers. Coffee was great, just not the sit in experience and it was well staffed we were there on a Saturday after buying a coffee i wanted to use the restroom, after waiting in a long line this was the state of the bathroom. very disgusting, no toilet seat, no soap in the dispenser, and the floor was sticky and wet. employees were very nice but the bathroom is horrible Cool place, one of best Costa interiors! Coffee good as well! Hungarian barista is best, she is nice lady Recommended Staff are super friendly and its a beautiful building. Cozy place, good for relaxing, work on laptop. Good services. OK, very busy - staff very pushy and unfriendly, treated me like an inconvenience while ordering my cappuccino. It was a very rushed and pretty unpleasant experience. I dont think Ill be returning. Fine if youre a student at Trinity and want a coffee rather desperately. The toilets STINK! I feel so bad for the staff. Its not their fault. They always look under pressure, sweating behind a counter, with way too many bodies there, trying to keep up with endless queues. These Starbucks and Costas are a disgrace. Just using and abusing people who need a job. No wonder the turnover is so high. I hope the baristas realise their worth and move elsewhere. Horrible chain. Perfect locations for majority of my visits to Dublin city. Beside Luas and bus routes that suit me. I would like tobmake a complaint about a very rude and arrogant female member of staff today she was so rude to myself and my girlfriend would not recommend here. I feel as someone who works with the public you need to employ staff that are qualified in that. Excellent service and place to have a good time alone, with friends or family. Lovely place to sit and enjoy your coffee on your tour around Dublin greatest sites. Bit busy, but quite a few places to sit, and its historical building so you can expect fireplaces and beautiful stucco on the ceiling. Few really fab photo options! Very unfriendly to tourists. Not recommended. Starbucks is much better"
45,Costa Coffee,3.375,"I LOVED this place! I came for my studies and spent almost all my days there. I tasted wonderful pastries there, drank very good white hot chocolate A place that is both relaxing and where it is also possible to chat quietly! I recommend this place 3000%. I loved this cafe so much, it s probably the place I miss the most since my return to France. Coffee cup not full, coffee not warm, taste not up to normal Costa standards, trays and cups left all over tables as staff who are not busy cant be bothered to go collect them... better to go somewhere else! Costa Coffee always comes to the rescue when I struggle to find cafes open after 4 pm in Dublin. The new Toffee Christmas drink was a delightful surprise absolutely delicious. The cinnamon roll, while good, was a tad dry. The cafes atmosphere is charming, but things get a bit chaotic when its crowded. A minor suggestion would be to have a designated spot to leave trays and empty mugs; it would be much easier to keep the tables clean for the next customer. Nevertheless, Costa Coffee is a great option for a warm drink and a cozy break, (especially during those tricky post-4 pm hours). Good Costa coffee as expected, great selection and wonderful service. price is similar to rest of EU.wifi is excellent, next to bus 16 to the airport and much more lines.They also serve soy milk, coconut milk. Great location and atmosphere but very unhappy with the food which was cold and both drinks contained alcohol, even though we ordered a Christmas orange hot chocolate and a Christmas latte which did not display that contains any alcohol, took a sip from both and left, waste of money especially with those prices (15 euro in total) for only small size. The guy taking my order was too concerned with the pastry he was eating to pay attention to what I was ordering. Forgot an item on the takeaway order . Love paying for items I don t receive. Coffee is just ok. We just came with my friends to relax and drink coffee, but the view is that. They are so noisy, and most of the people left because of them. They brought their scooter and bike, and they don t even have drink or food from Costa except tap water. They are so disrespectful. I think this store must have a security. One of the baristas came, but nothing changed. They are also vaping in inside. This happened in downstairs. Love this particular Costa...always pop in on my way to work for a really hot coffee Costa provides a very familiar mix of of goo coffee and great food options. In Dame Outlet worth checking out the beautiful vaulted cellars. Once Dalys coffee house from 18th century nice to know coffee is still being served. Great coffee and the seating area is very welcoming. I love this location, always try to come when i m in the area. They have great sandwiches and pastries as well. Nice place to sit in the city that isnt usually too crowded. Good coffee, the food is alright The autumn specials are delicious Food Great employees. Excellent food. Rudest manager I have ever met in my life. I recommend everyone to come here, but avoid that women at all costs!! She is racist too. I am not sure how she was in charge, but I was about to report her. Basically, I went to this coffee shop last year. As a student studying abroad in Dublin for the summer, I had a lot of belongings with me, and so I wanted to place it at a table before and then go up to order food & begin my studying. That day was also very stressful for me as well. But as I was just setting some of my belongings, this manager came up and started rudely talking to me about me needing to order food, or otherwise I couldnt sit at the shop. I was very confused by her tone, and told her that I was about to. She then proceeds to walk around the floor and come back to me not even 1 minute later. She tells me again that I will be removed from the shop if I did not order food right now, and that she had seen many people that are like me do this. I was very taken aback by this, and couldnt understand why she was acting like that. I was just about to go order coffee and some sweets. Right after this second encounter, I went up to order food, and told her that I really did not appreciate her behavior. She then began arguing more with me and raising her voice. I then finally became very angry, and then she backed down, noticing the attention drawn around us. She did not even say sorry, but just handed me a piece of chocolate out of her pocket to make me quiet. The lack of professional behavior was crazy, and I would never come back again. This is a relaxing space with soft leather couches and chairs, designed in such a way that it almost feels like a front room. A triple stained glass window lends atmosphere. The staff are very professional and friendly. The coffee is great and the cakes are delicious! Large plate glass windows give a great view, Trinity College is nearby, as us Grafton Street. You can relax with a book or do some computer work, or just meet a friend. Most Costas have this vibe. This product wasn t tagged properly. They charged me 4,20  for this little juice. When I asked why they charged me more?, they answered that maybe the product price increased. The place is beautiful and toilets clean though. They cant count money. Damage was 12.05. I handed 52.05 and she was trying to give me 37.95... I had to ask several times before I got my 40 euros back. Still she wasnt convinced. The place is nice and clean, but the coffee is a bit pricey and it doesnt taste that good. Also, many areas inside the coffee shop are closed all the time (with a few seats or tables). I understand that when it gets close to the closing time this helps the staff to keep that area clean, but this happens even at 2pm. Idk why Costa charges this much for a coffee that is... Just ok. What a dirty dump, trash everywhere, should be shut down for a deep clean.. its a bio hazard... lazy staff that dont listen to whats ordered, cancelled order once realised what a dump it was. Good place for coffee. A nice atmosphere too. A little more expensive then local coffee shops. Do not sit here unless you wish to be disrespected by the staff. Not worth it, the space is big and very well located but when I went all the tables still had dirty cups... The staff is not super friendly and the caramel frape tastes like water. Parking: Theres no parking Service is fantastic, staff are sound and this shop  wmhas a  a brilliant location. Right at the bus stop to so I find if my bus is not for another 15 mins  I go in and have. Wonderful warm gingerbread  latte! Chemical and bad tasting drinks. I do not recommend, rather prefer the famous American chain This was the first time I visited Costa Cafe. And tried their luxurious hot chocolate. And it was just amazing  . Great ambiance, very helpful staff. Just loved the Visit! Coffee was good but the staff not good enough they are making fun of me so disappointed Good location and area overall space is large. The staff looks changing continusly  always young and inesperienced people. While I was waiting for my coffee one person left, having waited so long. Lots of people go in here as a replacement of the university library, they would just sit and occupy every place close to a plug for laptop for hours without consumption! I just ordered a coffee here, watched the barista make my espresso in a filthy cup, froth my milk in a jug that was far from clean, and did it for so long that the drink was so hot it scalded my mouth. I have a blister already on my tongue and can feel my skin peeling at the roof of my mouth. I asked for more milk and said it was too hot. The barista rolled their eyes and put in a tiny drop of milk. My coffee tasted sour and bitter. I couldn t even drink it in the end. I like Costa Coffee, I prefer it over starbucks. But this particular one that I visited for the first time just today is closer to circus then coffee shop. There is familly sitting in front of me, they drinking caprisun and eating sandwiches (which apparently are not in the menu). There is also a customer, like 70 year old grandpa who just (as a customer) cleaned table after guest who just left as these young guys who work here were to busy to do their job. Grandpa deserved free coffee in my opinion and staff should talk less and do more. Grandpa on the right at the pic. A good place to meet a friend for somewhere to sit and chat, unfortunately inflation is a joke and the fact you pay 3.40 euro for a tea is ludicrous , a cup of flipping tea should never exceed 1.50-2.00 euro in cost, it s honestly getting ridiculous at this point. I d only go if it s essential (meeting a friend or job interview) I wouldn t go here in general, the price of the tea is daylight robbery, Costa please do better. I was also disappointed on compliance with the v passports not that long ago that many people choose to selectively forget about. The staff on the other hand there are friendly enough on a positive note. Good service, comfortable place , friendly staff and good coffee Near enough  4 for a coffee in a very dingy cafe with little effort displayed in the brown-formica themed space. The area around the coffee machine seemed a bit chaotic. That said, my bus was 18 minutes away and it was good to sit down. Like this coffee shop! They offer  tasty flat white and cappuccino.  Also, like their cups, thermoses, that I found handy. I will definitely recommend this place! We drink hot chocolate and it was  Nesquik , milk was bad and both of us get sick... Served by Darragh He was very upbeat and friendly first thing in the morning. Had a genuine interest in the customers. Bought a scone to go with my coffee, just because he was so nice The coffee and pastries are good, the welcome is friendly. Nothing exceptional, but the quality/price ratio is very good. Employees are a little odd. My partner was feeling rather generous and offered to pay for our coffees and croissants which we ate sitting inside. I asked an employee for directions to the restroom and was told I am not allowed to use the restroom as I m not a customer. I pointed towards the two cups of coffee and the two half eaten croissants on the table. The employee clarified that my partner is a customer as they paid for the purchases and I am loitering. I thought this was a joke until another employee backed the first employee and reiterated the same thing as I took a sip of my costa coffee. My partner and I found it very hard to maintain straight faces so we left without using the restroom. The English chain to change from its competitor Starbucks same price same product just its Costa we like it a lot Nice and cozy. Great view in the city. A good break from the noise of the rood of big Dublin City. Its always worth it a coffee here at weekends. Superb coffee and food Five stars for the location, in the heart of the city, for the place, always clean, elegant, with a calm atmosphere, it seems like being at home, for the fresh, good and well-made products, but above all for the staff, always smiling and kind, is undoubtedly my favorite coffee in the city Costa frappe is really one of the best beverages Ive had. The taste is good , thick and value for money."
46,Country Cafe,4.9,"Just quite simply as good as it gets!! The staff are just lovely, the food was perfectly fresh and plentiful & the price is just right. We had the Swiss Muesli bowl which was the best ever muesli bowl the missis has ever had, loaded with lovely fresh fruit, nuts, seeds and yoghurt! The Tuna wrap with fillings was beautifully made, super fresh and super tasty! Gorgeous and healthy smoothies too, well be back to try more! All so good in fact that weve ordered different dishes to take away and reheat for an early dinner (and CAKE!!) as were too busy today to search out an equally good dinner spot, so that says it all You can also call ahead and pre-order your lunch and save time if youre on the run, you wont be disappointed.... enjoy!! Excellent Breakfast! Low gentle Jazz music in the background, friendly staff, well priced priced!! Tasty, cozy, clean, pleasant staff.  A good place to rest. Lovely breakfast at reasonable price with friendly staff. Would definitely recommend Fantastic food   poached eggs,expresso, delicious bacon and sausage   hurry and try this place Lovely family run business, great service, all home made and cooked on the site.

Thank you :) Visited this cafe last Thursday with my sister we had a beautiful lunch she had the tuna wrap and  I had the scrambled eggs they were both amazing dishes for the price and we had very good quality tea. The place was spotless airy and the staff so pleasant and friendly and the toilets were also spotless will definitely be back when next in Dublin. Recommend to all. My favourite place in the city for great quality home cooked food. Best service and great bread, cakes and coffee. You will not be sorry. Fantastic service, great staff, gluten free bread and food options. As a coeliac I was very happy with everything. Went back several times during my trip and will return regularly. Relief to find great gluten free, affordable, definite not a rip off food. Great coffee also. Thank you Maria so much!!. It was a quaint and cozy little Cafe. My husband and I quite enjoyed the atmosphere, and the staff is incredibly nice! Also, the country breakfast was amazing! We were actually able to enjoy it all this time as other places that serve the Irish Breakfast make it a grease fest. With each bite, we didnt have grease splattering all over the place which is how it should be. Also, the coffee is strong with a nice kick to it. A good brunch to knock you awake pretty quickly.   Definitely will come back for the other things most likely as we saw Leek and Lentil quiche was on the menu, and between my spouse and I, its honestly the best combination. Delicious food, great coffee, kind staff, and a nice place to grab some lunch and chill a bit 10/10. A lovely cafe in the heart of Dublin City. The food is high quality and served with care and attention to detail. Very nice interior and very friendly and kind staff. Highly recommend! Absolutely love this place.. Family run business,  very friendly, very clean and gorgeous food. ! Love the cakes & the full Irish breakfast Food Excellent coffee and green juice , the muffins are the best in Dublin  - also had cottage pie - huge portions and great food. Love this place always consistently good food. Check it out Lovely breakfast served with a smile, probably the best poached eggs I ve ever had, recommended Really nice breakfast at a reasonable price staff are super friendly as well would definitely eat there again Maria and Vera will make your breakfast or lunch as you like it. Good range of fresh bakes and other savoury dishes. Good value. Such a nice little spot, I only had a cup of tea but the food smelled amazing and the menu looked great! Only here for a quiet and quick double espresso but holy wow the espresso they use is GOOD. Service prompt and friendly as well. Definitely recommend! Cheers! Great location on the Quays. I had to wait a little while for my tea to arrive but it was served with a smile. Pleasant surroundings. Reasonable cost, would go back. Took a while for food to arrive but it wasnt bad at all. Good prices. Love this little cafe staff are really friendly very welcoming and food is gorgeous. Highly recommend Food Best Coffe shop in town!! The smoked salmon & eggs are delicious and you wouldn t find a nicer Full Irish breakfast anywhere else. Very friendly staff and great service! Popped in for a drink and snacks late lunchtime.

Put it on your to go places list you wont be disappointed. Great food & coffee. Friendly staff and good service! Lovely food, nice people Had a great breakfast here! Really nice staff! Totally worth visiting Get two lunch during holidays, soups, dishes, and sandwich are hearty and excellent for a really good price. Staff is charming and patient. Very good place I highly recommend. Nice to get a sandwich or a soup in the city center and not wonder where all your money went. Excellent cup of coffee and I love the turkey and ham sandwich. But the meals in some places to shame. Georgious FULL breakfast (INC THE TEA) they dont call it a full breakfast for no reason!! I was deffo full after!!! V-FRIENDLY STAFF AND EVEV DID ME FRIED BREAD WHEN I ASKED YUMMMMM!

Amazing selection  of fabulous food...great quality , delicious  and the people that run it and their staff sre brilliant!"
47,Craft Coffee Roasters,3.975,"I got a decaf oat flat white and it tastes a bit burnt but free pass because decaf is usually not great. The brownie, menu said 2,75, was four euro. Four euro. Regular size, tastes cheap/fake, definitely not worth four euro. This place has really nice vibes, good space, and is not crowded. loved the coffee. And they also serve several desserts and bakeries. Food This is a very nice place. Spacious, fab light, great soundtrack and brilliant service. You find good coffee and good gluten free chocolate brownies (Im partial.. there are many other things but mostly with gluten). Its closing late for Dublin and this is another brilliant thing. I just like this cafe. Neat place, ok prices I guess, the pastries are low quality but its everywhere in the city the same thats fine tbh. Best silky oat milk latte and yummy sausage rolls(big) Only 7  for both , really good for Dublin !! Dont come here! Service is really bad, they set every order as a large size by default which is twice more expensive and answer rude when asking for refund. Almost as a scam! So awesome to have a super high quality coffee spot in D8 quays area as there are next to no places around here! Such a nice place, awesome cakes and lovely service Craft Coffee Roasters stays true to its roots. It makes great coffee in a short time and for a better price than other places nearby. Other places in this area charge higher prices for their coffees which take over double the time to make. I d recommend coming here in future - unless you want to spend near  5 for a coffee elsewhere! Well this is the place that deserves more than 5 stars rate from me! I came here many many times and I will still come back when I return to Dublin to enjoy really good quality coffee. The staff is friendly and nice, the place is comfortable to sit down and enjoy/work in a good atmosphere. They also provide good & tasty pastries and daily-freshly made sandwiches. For me this is the best coffee place in Dublin (and I have been in almost all of them around the centre!). Just love it; I will be back Love it here, staff is so friendly and goes the extra effort of asking your name and getting to know you. If you want somewhere you can walk in and get the regular, this is it! Decor is cool, and seating arrangement neat as well, the benches are comfy with loads of pillows. Food is pretty good as well, fresh daily! Perfect place for a coffee, very friendly service and surprisingly quiet and spacious. Apparently quietish, in terms of seating, in the mornings and then busier from early afternoon. Had a mocha and Americano, both were worth taking time to smell and savour the coffee hit. Carrot cake was good, next visit, will try the chocolate brownies. several gluten free options. Recommended. -Friendly Barista -Nice soy latte -Husband   enjoyed a Nutella latte -Funky -Comfy seating -Great layout -Good background music Expensive for the area, but located close to Guinness and Whiskey tour venues. Recommend Very nice cafe with quality food and reasonable pricing. Also coffee is great Amazing place to grab a coffee. My friend and I spent the day working from here when he visited Dublin. Nice, quiet place to have a relaxing time and a delicious coffee. Staff are wonderful. Looking forward to coming back Felt in love with this place  , had a lovely cappuccino ,will be back soon for sure. Very cute, cozy coffee shop. For those of you who love almond milk or drink it because you have an intolerance like I do, they have Almond milk! I had the Mocha Latte. It was tasty. Not too sweet. Good atmosphere but poor customer service experienced today by male staff at counter  Akis  #COULDBEBETTER. Amazing Vibe , beautiful decor / very cosy - Tasty Coffee and smiley & friendly Barrista :) Ive walked past this cafe many times so happy went in this morning & experienced such a cute vibe and good coffee ( and TeaCake ;) ) Great start to a Rainy Day .. Food I chose this coffee shop because it has a good rating, but I don t understand why. The coffee was horrible.  Very bitter. I went on Sunday. On GoogleMaps its open, in fact closed. Our team was disappointed The atmosphere is really nice and the coffee is always good! Definitely a place to try! Google maps says it closes at 18 on sundays. I went for no reason. Excellent place!!! It is good to come and have a cappuccino in order to relax. Beautiful atmosphere with music that blends into the vibe. Thanks to the barrista that served me Akis Stratis the coffee was divine, would come here everyday for the taste of coffee. Food This place is a coffee joke. I do not know why are they called a roaster but the lady doesn t know what they serve. Just not worth it if you are in coffee! Its really cool places like this exist prices are pretty good for it being located in the hearth of Dublin. The lady in front is very kind and pleasing. But the negative is that its a small sorta room. But it conpensates by the atmosphere its awesome. Would come again. If you want the best cup of coffee in Dublin and the friendliest staff at the best price, you have to visit Craft Coffee Roasters. Top notch. Wheelchair accessibility: Excellent access. Coffee and Hot Chocolate are great. Lovely atmosphere and great location. Food : 5/5 Beautiful coffee and the staff are the best around so polite and humours great service all round hightly recommended Great coffee and super friendly and nice workers! The place is beautiful and clean Very nice staff member.Clean. Nice vibe. Great coffee and excellent almond croissant. Nice place Nice coffee Nice staff Revommend Food : 4/5 | Cant say much about the coffee, as I dont drink it in general, but they have nice selection of teas, original, flavoured, as well as delicious iced tea, as well as very tasty pastries and cakes. Perfect spot for grabbing treats when around Four Courts area. Also the staff is brilliant! This is a nice cafe with a very chill/modern style (opposed to the hispter/vintage type). I prefer this type of cafe over the before mentioned style because it is less distracting with all the decor. But at the same time have enough/simple decor with ambient noise. There are a few outlets along the wall but not abundant. Drink menu is simple and also have period special drinks. Opens at 7am, which is good time to get my morning drinks! Great coffee, bit expensive for 2 coffees, scone and a flap Jack, would still be back cos the coffee was good I get coffee here sometimes before getting the bus to work as it is next to the bus stop. The staff are very friendly, coffee and pastries are good Its a good spot to have nice coffee with an easy breakfast for a fair price. Its not special but still very tasty! The Coffee ist great, very comfortable atmosphere and a friendly barista. A nice morning cup of coffee. Very friendly place with music atmosphere. You can see sign portraits of many famous stars on the walls. If you need relax and smooth coffee, come right here."
48,Custom House Visitor Centre,4.6,"Inexpensive and informative but also just not a very visually or materially impressive self-guided tour An absolute gem on Dublins past that I didnt know exist before actually walking into it. The exhibition relies on text and a few well made videos with a handful of artifacts, so youll want to join the guided tour for a full (and often private!) storytelling experience. So much to cover the tour can go far beyond one hour. Tony is a brilliant guide, sharing with us the history with a bit of personal stories. A great place to learn about the recent history of Dublin and Ireland that leads up to the free state. Heading to EPIC and just happened to pop in. Inexpensive tickets, short tour, but invaluable to understanding the Revolutionary experience. Highly recommend! Thirteen most significant Rivers of Ireland emblazon the external architecture of The Custom House built in 1687 yet today only the Munster Blackwater has a sustainable salmon run. Just back from a guided tour with out Autusm class. Guide Harry absolutely amazing and his presentation had our students enthralled.  Great day and experience.  Thanks to all Just had a mesmerizing experience starting at The Customs House Visitors Centre thoroughly enhanced by the wonderful Dublin Discovery Trails app which allowed me to witness the burning of the Customs House in 1921 through virtual reality. Dublin Discovery Trails helps to guide you on a journey of discovery to some of the Citys most loved sites and attractions, enabling you to uncover compelling stories of Dublins culture, heritage and history via themed GPS- enabled walking trails and augmented reality tours. 10 of Dublins most famous statues have been given the gift of the gab! Pass a Talking Statue, swipe your smartphone on a nearby plaque and presto, get a call back from James Joyce (written by Roddy Doyle and voiced by Gabriel Byrne), Oscar Wilde (written by John Banville and voiced by Andrew Scott), or Fidelity on the OConnell Monument (written by Paula Meehan and voiced by Ruth Negga)! Each has a story to tell. Together, they tell Dublins story. From Brendan Gleeson, Eoin Colfer to Brendan OCarroll and Brenda Fricker, the array of Irish talent is there for all to hear on your very own personal phonecall and piece of Dublin History. A thoroughly compelling use of todays technology to remind us of our cultural heritage. Great spot to get a precis on the building of the Custom House and its role in Irish history. Particularly recommend the short movie on the burning of the building during the War of Independence Just after enjoying an incredible tour with the wonderful Yvonne. 100% worth a visit to get some insight and knowledge on such an important and significant part of the Dublin skyline. Brought a group of university students from Loras College for a tour of the Custom House and was very impressed!  Best 3 euros/person we spent.  Yvonne tailored the talk to our interests and wrapped together history, politics, economics, and geography into an hour-plus discussion.  We all learned a lot about Ireland and would certainly recommend this tour! Great experience for this historic place in Ireland History. Reccomend the guided tour. Very knoledgefull guide. Thanks to Thomas for the tour. We appreciated it. Great tour, knowledgeable staff Beautiful building and fascinating history. Great tour for locals and visitors. We opted for guided tour and were delighted we did. Hugely informative and interesting. Many thanks to our guide Thomas - we learned so much. Would highly recommend. Lovely little museum, well worth a visit. Good history from the 18th to 21st centuries. This is a beautiful building of huge historical signifigence, I did a tour of the outside (The River Gods) as well as an inside tour where I learned the history of the place and the man who designed it, James Gandon. Well worth a visit...and Im Irish! This is a very good addition to the cultural scene in Dublin. You will learn about the history of the building, but there is too much focus on historic events that are not related to the Custom House. There is also too much on the 1921 burning of the building. It would be good to have seen the original plans and more info on the development of the port. But the star of the show is the building itself, go and enjoy it. We took the 4pm guided tour yesterday and although there was a great array of information boards and interactive videos the guide rushed through the 1 hour indoor tour, speaking so fast we could not understand him. I  will go back again to take time to read the well presented information but would not take the tour. I  also recommend going earlier than 4pm so as not to be rushed out the door! Very informative museum about the history of the beautiful customs building. If you were at the Epic museum previously you qualify for an admission discount. Easy to understand exhibits with the included audio device. Beautifully architected Custom House. We will come back again. Our visit to the customs House was made all more special by our guide Yvonne she was spectacular. A very interesting trip. Tom Ec school of English. The best tours are given by people who love their job. Custom House visitor center is open less than a year but such a beautiful addition to Dublin and its history. Do stop and learn about one of most beautiful buildings on Quays. The Custom House was a fantastic place to visit over the weekend, but what truly made it one to remember was the tour guide who was so passionate in what she was teaching. Thank you so much Shauna Fletcher, you are a credit to your managers! Small but interesting museum, extremely friendly staff Easy to follow. Its worth to visit. Very beautiful place I went to visit this visitor centre at the Custom House for the first time today (19-03-2022). Its really interesting place. I thought I never visited any visitor centres like that before in my entire life. Id like to visit this place again someday. This place seems like its on the up and up. If this is your first stop in Ireland its a great way to soak up some history of the times and the area! Calm museum about the history of the building, Dublin and Ireland during the fight for independence Lots to see. Our group was a bit rushed for time so couldnt enjoy to the fullest. Important history here. The guided tour was amazing, super detailed and very interesting! I recommend ! Just completed a wonderful tour of the Custom House building. Its a very informative and interesting tour, highly recommended. Nice food but be prepared to que for at least 25 minutes Great walking tour by the staff. Amazing history here. A place with wallpaper of pictures, history and some videos showing from projectors. Only opened a limited number of small rooms. The tour guide was so good she really brought the history to life Fantastic tour. A must place to visit when in Dublin. Very interesting. Great historical knowledge. History well maintained! Friendly warm hearted welcoming people. Easy to get there excellent guided tour Freedom party had rally Vorab sei erwahnt dass ich das Museum nur von aussen gesehen habe und es nicht besucht habe. Wie viele offentliche aber auch einige private Gebaude sind hier viele antik griechische Einflusse in der Architektur zu sehen. Wer hierfur interessiert ist, sollte sich das ansehen. Die Lage ist auch relativ zentral also macht es keine grossen Umwege."
49,Dalton's Musical History Tour,5.0,"A superb personalized ballad, enchanted and in song, which changes the spirit of a classic visit. Let yourself walk with Fiona. Mary Poppins 2024. I wish her great success. A superb personalized ballad, enchanted and in song, which changes the spirit of a classic visit. Let yourself walk with Fiona. Mary Poppins 2024. I wish her great success. We arranged to experience the tour as a group, and it was a lot of fun. Fiona was energetic and easy to follow (despite having to shout over occasional traffic), has a fantastic singing voice, and had a great set of historic points to talk about. She even got us to sing along for some of them - we didnt know all of the songs but singing along to the ones we did was tons of fun. Highly recommended! nan nan"
50,DoDublin Bus Tours,4.55,"We were so pleased we chose to do the Do Dublin tour!!  Our bus driver, John, was an absolute legend!  Very informative and extremely funny!  Great way to get about and learn about the landmarks and history of the city! Probably the best hop on hop off tour we have ever done, commentary can unusually be heard so clearly through the loud speakers in the bus, no need for earphones, drivers had a great sense of humour Definitely well worth the 30 euros Best bus tour!! Jer was a legend, full of knowledge, good laugh and voice of an angel!! Glad we picked green over red!! What a great tour bus experience! I have made a habit of using tour buses in cities that I visit, but this one is the best by far. The kids , as well as the adults, absolutely loved the Live commentary. So funny, informative and helpful. We had a 48hour ticket, so had the pleasure to hear many different Drivers/guides, Bill, Sean, John and Jay, all Amazing! (Hope I got all the names and right) Thank you! The bus was on time and the bus driver was knowledgeable, positive, and friendly. Even if you like to walk everywhere, it s fun to hop on the bus to see the city from a different vantage point. It was an experience in itself. The bus tour was great! It gives you some vouchers, discounts and free entry into a couple of bits so definitely worth checking before you start you visit if you were going to do anything they include anyway! Takes you all round the city so really good if you wanted to look at places a bit further out, you can use it as travel but also have some great commentary on your journey. The tour guides we had were hilarious! It definitely made the journey fun! We got the 48 hour pass as not much more than the 24hr and you can use it as much as you want! Would 100% recommend, so glad we chose this!! Made the trip what it was! We wouldnt have done a couple of the things we did has we not been on this tour! This tour is really good even for natives like me. Its my second time doing it the last time was in 2016. I had my 12yr old son and 5yr old daughter with me. My son found it really interesting and took loads of photos but after about an hour  my daughter said this is a bit boring for me! Thats understandable though. We didnt get the full benefit of it we just stayed and did the tour rather than hop on and off which I would recommend doing. It was a very hot day and the driver told me how hot it can get up the top recommending suncream which we had. Really enjoyed this hop on-hop off tour! It was a great way to see the city and learn about the highlights. We had a couple different drivers, but the best by far was Richie! He was great. So friendly, lively and fun! Fantastic tour this sunny Friday afternoon. I couldn t get off the bus because of the guide/driver. His name is John. he knows history,art, shopping, entertainment, politics, restaurants and bars all of it made funny and he is an excellent singer and entertainer! Someone give this guy a TV program! Dublin was beautiful under the autumn sun! 100% recommended! Incredible service and staff that go above and beyond. Recommend this locally owned service over the competitors. Even organized a  rescue effort  of a phone I accidentally left behind on one of their buses For English speakers I recommend taking the  live tour  vs. the recorded one. Thanks for the help and the great service! This hop on hop off tour was one of the best that I have been on. They all give you a high level look at the city and of course you can get on and off at your leisure but what separated this from the others was the DRIVER! Mary was a complete surprise and delight. We didn t listen to the prerecorded script that you get when your on these tours but instead she narrated the complete tour on her own. She covered all the highlights and added in some personal antidotes and jokes along the way plus she sang the songs that are canned music on the other tours. Hats off to DoDublin and especially to Mary, job well done! Damien was our tour guide today and he was excellent (with the tour and with driving that huge bus in such a busy city)! Great insight into the city history and also some local insider knowledge. We had fun! Would highly recommend We really recommend the DoDublin bus trip!! We had a fantastic few rides on the buses. Richie was a great laugh and as my husband said he had a voice of an angel!!  We stayed on for the full trip and got good info of the city as we went! Thank you again!! Great way to explore much of the city, with fun drivers as well! The walking tour is fantastic--very informative, and grounds you well in the history and ability to navigate the center of Dublin. Great value bus tour in Dublin. Goes to or near all the major landmarks. Children are currently free with a paying adult, which made them the best value for me on my visit. Very friendly staff and drivers and lovely commentary (in English) all the way round. Great experience and well worth the money. Your the city and done where you wish to get off and explore First time doing a hop on/off bus. Maybe it was the time of year (April 2024) but our tour was nothing more than a very cold bus ride listening to a pre-recorded geo-fenced recording. Our first bus had no heat and we all froze.  The recording said that we could go into the library at Trinity College for free, but when we got off the bus at Trinity the guard at the college said there was a per person charge to go in the library. Maybe they hadn t updated their recording.  Our driver seemed unhappy and offered no information over the Microphone.  On a later bus, the driver was more vocal and that made for a better trip. Great tour Great laugh the guys now there stuff Ohhh p.s to the driver we had Thursday 7th March Whiskey was made by the Scots Fantastic way to see Dublin, learn your way around and sightsee while learning all about Dublin.  Got a 48 hour pass and it was well worth it.  I did the multi language tour (recorded tour) and the English only live tour.  I liked them both but the live tour was fabulous (thanks Kirk Morrow driver/guide).  He was so good I did the full loop just to hear all the stories!  I did do the hop on/off as well which is so convenient.  It was sunny, cold, windy and sometimes rainy but still awesome.  I highly recommend Marshs Library right next to St Patricks, Kilmainham Gaol (powerful) and Phoenix Park with the Dublin Zoo.  There are SO many great places all along the tour including Trinity College, Molly Malone statue, General Post Office, the Spire, Customs House, all the bridges, Guinness, Oscar Wilde, etc., etc., etc.  There is definitely something for everyone. There are several options for the ubiquitous open top city bus tours. My wife and I selected DoDublin based on factors such as positive reviews and pricing. Our tickets were purchased online and we utilized the electronic voucher for boarding which was seamless. The drivers were superb.  They were professional, informative and entertaining. Unfortunately there was an instance where DoDublin really let us down which almost resulted in missing our Kilmainham Gaol tour (which can be a very difficult ticket to get). We waited at one of the stops (#6) for the first bus of the day. We observed the DoDublin bus approaching from stop #5 but it then turned off the designated route, not to be seen again. An email enquiry and complaint to DoDublin was responded to with the following: Unfortunately, we were only alerted that there was a gas leak up by stop 6 and our services were diverted from this area. We were only made aware of this and in turn could not alert customers. Due to this factor being outside of our control and our services till operating, and the ticket being activate, we would not be in the position to refund these tickets. Regards, Jack O Donoghue Commercial Department This was odd as the gas leak was reported in the news at 07:41h and almost two hours later at 09:20h as we stood by stop 6, the road was completely fine. In addition, other tour buses as well as over a dozen local buses drove past our stop along Merrion Road without issue. We eventually got a DoDublin bus 30min later. It is unfortunate that this inconvenience to its customers is apparently of little concern to DoDublin. A gesture of goodwill such as perhaps an extension of the ticket by 4-6 hours would incur no cost to DoDublin. Instead they adopted a stringent company-first position resulting in a much less than satisfied customer. A cool and great way to see Dublin s major attractions. Hop on and hop off along 33 stops around Dublin. Passes range from 24 to 72 hours. Can buy passes combined with major attractions that come with fees like the Guinness storehouse. We sat on top and all the way at the back of the double decker bus and we got fantastic views. Added bonus if the driver is really funny. We had  Gorgeous  Jason and he made the entire ride really fun and entertaining. This is a great deal if your in town for a couple days. I got the 48 hour hop on hop off with 72 hour public transportation and round trip to airport for 40 . The buses stop at almost anywhere you d want to visit as tourist. Some bus are better than others because sometimes the drivers narrates the tour live on a microphone, much better than listening to a pre recorded message. The first driver I had was pretty much a comedian, the entire bus was laughing the entire way. Overall all of the drivers will be very polite and helpful with any suggestions. I actually left my leather gloves on the bus and caught back around and found them with no issues. Highly recommended!!! Fantastic way to get around Dublin. Our drivers were both informative and funny. The upper deck in the open air was a great way to have an unobstructed view for some great photos. Fantastic tour, a great way to explore the city and see all the main attraction spots. The driver was very knowledgeable and explained the historical aspects very well! What an amazing adventure with Joe our tour guide.  Joe chatted to us while the bus was waiting to leave the 1st stop and had plenty of yarns throughout the tour.  Great way to experience and explore Dublin.  He even had some rude customers who got on the wrong bus (live commentary not multilingual) and was polite and helpful and apologetic (wasn t needed) to them the whole time despite their continued rudeness I loved this hop on hop off bus! The drivers are super entertaining as well, especially Richie and Johnny Mack!! Great experience. Drivers were knowledgeable about Dublin history. Great way to learn about the city and also get a cheap ride around town. Tour lasts about a hour and a half to make the full loop. Very good for visiting Dublin and discovering the different sites, you can stop whenever you want and take the next bus every 20 minutes On the other hand, I find 30 euros a bit expensive for adults. Spent two days in Dublin on my way home to Canada so I got a 48 hour hop-on hop-off pass for the DoDublin bus. We had a few drivers and all were very good but my favourite was Cillian! His tour (like all the others) was informative but he was very funny and very helpful to all the passengers who travelled with him while I was on his bus. His recommendations were excellent and he was right when said not to miss the Guinness tour! I can now pour a PERFECT pint of Guinness and have the certificate to prove it! I look forward to returning for another tour with Cillian and belting out another rendition of the Wild Rover! I recommend you get on and go ALL the way around (takes 1 hour, 45 minutes) taking in the sites and as much info as you can. Make notes of the stops you would like to explore and then on subsequent trips hop-on and off exploring. You get bonus info from each driver and I found the 48 hour pass to be a great value! This bus tour was useful as it was our first visit to Dublin. A great way to get your bearings with whitty comments from the bus driver!!. We found it useful when visiting places as we avoided wasting time getting lost!! Earphones are useful as sometimes the traffic noise can interfere with the commentary. The bus is frequent but obviously city centre traffic can delay it later in the day. Bought the go Dublin 3 day bus ticket which is worth it as you need the correct fair when travelling on local buses and the hop on hop off bus is free to use as part of the ticket deal and children can ride free (on the hop off/on bus). What a pleasant way of exploring the lovely city  of Dublin.Good information was given and the route was well thought out.Stopping at major attractions or giving me as tourist a chance to save the places on my Google Maps to visit later Poor communication with the driver. Just told to scan a QR code, no signage to say how much it would cost. Shut on the bus to then get onto website only to find out we d been ripped off  57.43. We felt obliged to pay as we were visitors to the City. Thank you tourist pirates. Seamus was great during our glendalough and powerscourt tour today! The people in the bus cant stop talking to each other which makes listening to the driver hard. Well paced tour and friendly/funny driver (Greg).  comfortable bus with good sound system Nice open air bus. It runs every 50 minutes. It offers free entry tickets to a few museums! Good to see most of the city center and beyond! The driver (Alan) made the trip very enoyable with his informative, funny and very knowledgable commentary. I would highly recommend this company. Had a few different drivers in Dublin. So knowledgeable and clearly great at their jobs. We rode with Mary a couple of times and we had the best experience! Found Do Dublin as we were walking down the street and took a chance - would never hesitate to ride with them again! Pretty good bus tour. The top floor was just a recorded tour. Later on in the day we had the driver give the tour on the main bus floor which was much much better. They give you the option of a two day pass and will drop you off at different stops! Overall pretty enjoyable minus the recorded tour which can be a bit hard to hear. Decided to take my son on  Do Dublin bus tour yesterday, and we had an amazing time, a great way for both adults and children to brush up on history. There are plenty of historical sights and information given by our tour guide.     Id ask for tour guide Ritchie he had us laughing so much our faces hurt. Would recommend this tour 100% Quite dirty , overcrowded,waiting time is around 20 min , sometimes even more. On top, not all the time the audio system is working. Plus, sometimes guides are not talking at all, or just joking around ."
51,Dubh Linn Garden,4.725,"the flowers at the garden are stunning. i ve been here in different times of the year and i have to say, flowers make a big difference :) the sculptures are also great to see. the park is a real gem hidden in the historic area. Absolutely gorgeous garden right outside of Dublin Castle so much so that I enjoyed it more than the castle itself. Definitely was very crowded since the weather was nice, but everyone seems to respect the sense of peace and quiet. Very special spot during sunny days, I loved and recommend.

Beautiful little garden. We can go around there. The only point that could spoil it are the cranes, visible, located behind it. Super well maintained and beautiful garden with stunning views of the castle. Great quiet green space to sit in all year round with access to the Chester Beatty Museum Walked around this spot and was very impressed. The park was beautifully maintained, and really what you would expect Dublin to feel like. The location was busy at all, and we spent quite a bit of time here enjoying the area and castle itself. I would highly recommend a visit here. Its a small and free garden to visit. If you would like to capture a photo with better background of castle, its better to come out of castle and visit this garden. Beautiful little garden. I skipped the castle and walked in here instead. Wasnt disappointed. A beautiful public garden that is a haven of tranquil peace in an urban setting. It is designed as a pollinator garden and as such attracts bees and butterflies. The garden was created to honor fallen members of the Irish Garda. Nice garden but if you hadnt planned to go there its not a big deal. If visiting, allow around half an hour. Dubh Linn Garden   is the most beautiful    panorama spot from Dublin. You have e great    experience if you want to stay a few time here. Is a lot of history here. You will understand why you need to relax    here were people    love the nature. Pretty little garden near Dublin Castle. A main, circular area, with grass in its center then additional areas on each side to discover. With pleasant weather it is a good place to relax. Beautiful and spectacular garden alongside Dublin Castle   If you are a first time visitor you definetly should spend a good time there! Unlike most parks in the stunt, this park is not calm and crowded. A lush area surrounded by a castle. There are many restaurants and cafes around. It is also very clean and well-maintained. You can spend time here when you catch the sun. (: Nice garden to take a stroll around with an adjoining gallery that is free to enjoy. After visiting Dublin castle, we took rest at this pleasant place. Flowers and lawn looking very beautiful. Great place with nice views and greenery. Looks amazing in spring. It is a good to just chill and maybe take pictures but its a small garden not for walks/jogs not a lot of walking space. It is nice to spend some time in this nice and quite place and have a rest. Tough in the middle of the town, the place is mostly not crowded and offers you some peace moments after a busy day or during a guided tour. These gardens are located behind Dublin Castle and nearby the Chester Beatty Library.The circles design inside the grassfield is copied from an helicopter landing field. Lovely Garden, spent quite a bit of time wandering around, looking at the art installations. It was lovely and quiet, peaceful and relaxing. Beautiful garden with the flowers in bloom.  I could have spent all day here This a very lovely place. There is also a memorial for cops fallen is the line of duty at the corner closest to the Dublin Castle. Unfortunately the fountains were not working on the day I visited. Not much here other than a really nice park! Worth a visit if youre looking for somewhere to sit for a pit. If visiting the castle, worth having a quick look at least. We wanted to see the castle but it was under construction so we went for a walk around the building and found this little park and had a break in the shadow and look at the lovely green and blooming park. Excellent had a fantastic time and a incredible interesting tour of Dublin castle amazing history I would highly recommend to all tourist this is a must ! It fill in so much of the history of Dublin you would be truly missing out. Absolutely beautiful place. Very well kept. Very well designed. Very peaceful. A well-designed and planted garden with numerous calming spaces given its compact size. It s a short amble from Dublin castle and the benches and paths offer chances to sit, stroll and reflect (or just decompress from the old-men portraits of the apartments if you ve recently toured them). The Garda memorial was gently moving and the volume of bees and blooms was a blessing. Beautiful in the May sunshine and hands down my favourite and most symbolic helipad! Beautiful gardens, green designed lawns, people relaxing, sleeping, picnics, and sculptures of Dublin. Super cute garden to rest We ve been walking around for two days in the wind and rain, walking in here was like stepping into a secret garden with a break from the wind and all these flowers are blooming. It s just really precious. Great spot for photos and a break from the bustle of being a tourist for a few minutes. Beautiful garden, lots of lovely plants, sculptures, and a relaxing place to sit. You can walk the grounds and have a picnic on the grass or benches.. Sit in the garden area. Or go into the library located near by.. Beautiful gardens with a history. Possibly my favourite part of visiting Dublin Castle. Learning about how Dublin got its name was a pleasant addition to an already pleasant experience. Very pleasant park to stroll, read or have lunch between two visits Dubh Linn Garden is adjacent to Dublin Castle. It is nice place to walk with some more less hidden corners. I liked there the pink statue and some other pieces of art. There is also narrow path in the central grass area. You can also see the Record Tower from here. Great historical gardens! We found this spot while on a guided tour in Dublin. Fascinating stories and history. Even my daughter found a spot to linger... Small city center park but also not very crowded! :) Big plus on all the pollinator plants in the park all the happy bees and bumblebees! Very interesting garden multiple attractions. I went after sunset and it was raining a little it was very nice!"
52,Dublin Castle,4.525,"We spent 1,5 hours there with a self guided tour and enjoyed it! They provide interesting information and historical facts in every room. Also we were surprised to meet a music festival in the castle yard so we enjoyed it too. Guided tours were all sold out on Saturday midday. Visited on Awesome place to visit. The written guide is enough to immerse yourself in the history of this castle and every room is majestic and beautiful. Amazing atmosphere everywhere. Definitely worth a visit to get to know Ireland a bit better and to see some pieces of art. The tour will take you around 1 hour. You can buy the tickets onsite without any problems if you dont go during weekends. A must visit if you are interested in Irish history. We were lucky enough to have a guide with us who was very knowledgeable and able to bring the history alive. The castle area itself is lovely to walk around and there is a cafe, a museum and small bookshop. It is free to enter and there are toilet facilities. If you like art this is your place, each room of the castle has beautiful paintings and small amount of history written on a sign. The castle is very walkable. My family and I only did the self guided tour and we got to see a lot but there were a few perks more if you do the guided tour. It s a cheap get away from the hustle. Dublin Castle is a must-visit historical gem in the heart of the city! This iconic landmark spans over 800 years of Irish history, offering a fascinating glimpse into Irelands past. The guided tour is absolutely worth it - knowledgeable guides bring the castles rich history to life with engaging stories and lesser-known facts. From the medieval tower to the opulent State Apartments, every corner exudes historical significance. The beautiful gardens provide a tranquil escape from the busy city. Dont miss the underground excavation site showcasing Viking and medieval Dublin. Whether youre a history buff or just curious, Dublin Castle delivers an enriching, unforgettable experience. A true highlight of any Dublin visit! Dublin castle is a nice visit. I visited on a Wednesday and got a free tour to my surprise. Not sure how it happened. The guided tour will take you to places like the life chapel and gunpowder tower which you cannot visit self guided. It was the seat of 750 years of British rule in Ireland. And many historical events took place here. The Irish presidents are sworn to the office here Nice looking structure located at a square, very vibrant and easy walking distance to other areas of the city center. There s free self guided tours inside. A beautiful piece of history here in Dublin. The castle and palace have multiple rooms that are opulent and beautiful, and tons of artwork to enjoy. We spent about 1 hour wandering through the castle and enjoying the interesting furniture, decor, art pieces, and history associated with each room. A guided tour is available for a small increase in ticket price (4 euros), but the self guided tour with the directory is also informative and enjoyable. There is a nice garden to relax in behind the castle, and entrance to the garden is free. Wonderful place to visit. This is a working residence that allows you to wander around rooms and places that king s queens and sitting presidents have walked in. The guide was very informative. Make sure to do the guided tour so you can visit the medieval walls under the building. Good for everyone. Dublin castle showcases state rooms and museums. A lot about Irish history and one spectacular large rooms. Nevertheless when in Dublin it s worth a visit.. the garden behind was nice with lovely views of the castle. And the Chapel Royal. We love our castles so thought we would give this one a try while we were nearby for a few days. We paid for the guided tour which wasnt expensive at about PS15 a person (might be slightly off as cant remember exact price). We would recommend booking a ticket unless you dont mind a little wait (ours was 45mins) but the guided tour is well worth the price. Tour guide was really good and gives your the whole history and you go into areas the public dont go into. Well preserved Castle in Dublin. Admission is 8 euros per adult person without guide... You dont need to buy ticket online I think. Especially in the morning.. There is so many paintings inside.. Dont forget to visit garden outside... Great for self guided tours. You can download a free app for the audio tour. Plenty to see. We paid 20 Euros for a family of five. If you want a guided tour, you must book in advance. You can also pay to see other areas of the castle. Great value for money! Learned a lot about the Irish history and their art collection is amazing! Beautiful castle! We paid for the guided tour for  12 each. Definitely worth the extra  4 difference from the self guided tour. Roisin was an excellent guide. She took us underground to see the old castle walls, told us a brief history of the country, took us into the Chapel, and then finally to the state rooms. We would never have found out so many interesting things by just wondering around by ourselves. Fully recommend! I went in the middle of January, off season. I had a blast. The guided tour was worth it.  The Chapel Royal was well preserved. The record tower is the only intact part of the original Castle. The Rest of the buildings were the center of Government during Irish and British rule. So much history here. I would highly recommend checking it out. I wasnt as impressed as I hoped I would be.  The turrets are mostly gone.  The more expensive tour will take you on a quick walk through subterrain ruins, a cathedral and a few interesting rooms that are still used for affairs of state.  Im still trying to figure out the statue in the courtyard and the one over the entrance. It was a lovely experience. I liked walking around the building and sitting in the small garden having a coffee, and to be inside and see all the furniture and art. Also one of the halls is still working for the official meetings. This is just for the free area of the castle grounds. Lots of construction currently but still nice to see. Church. Courtyard, clock tower. Self guided tour 8 . Guided tour includes more rooms (?16 ?) Pro tip: don t miss Chester Beatty nearby. Visited on A generally good museum experience. Very ornate rooms and paintings. My only reason for not rating higher is because I think Dublin castle ended up paling in comparison to other castles we visited in Ireland and Scotland. After seeing Edinburgh Castle and Stirling Castle in Scotland and then seeing Dublin Castle, Dublin Castle felt a bit lackluster. Make sure to visit the Dubh Linn garden right outside if you visit its gorgeous! Wonderful place ! A must do if you visit Dublin. The castle is beautiful and thanks to the little booklet, we learn a lot about the rooms of the castle. It is a place steeped in history. Entrance is 8 euros. It takes 1 hour to visit, taking your time. It s a nice place to see. Maybe an hour worth of walking, reading and viewing. Couple of rooms are astonishing, but nothing breath taking. The staff are helpful and friendly. HORRIBLE Ticket system and line. Almost got double-charged bacause their card-terminal was as old as the castle itself. But once you get in...paintings and furniture...paintings and furniture...paintings and furniture...paintings and furniture...paintings and furniture...paintings and furniture...paintings and furniture...paintings and furniture. Quite nice actually! It was unexpectedly beautiful inside. Worth a self-guided tour visit. The gardens in the back are pretty and relaxing. One of the coolest castles I ve seen here in Ireland. Beautifully built and historically preserved! A magnificent castle that reminds me more of a palace like Schonbrunn in Vienna, yet not as massive. Dating back 800 years, the castles interior is exquisite along with the art on display. This is where the British Empire relinquished control to Michael Collins representing the liberated Irish Republic in 1922. Fascinating to be able to stand where history was made. A must visit in Dublin if you are interested in history , art and culture Many paintings, sculptures, furniture related to history, rulers and higher families The castle is nice. They provided guided tours for $12.00 and self just 8.00 We did the self-guided tour here which was nice as we could go at our own pace. Loved all of the architecture and views. If you want a guided tour(highly recommended)purchase right at the entrance. You get access to areas not on the self tour. To me this was more a museum than a Dublin Castle. Plenty of history here and allow time for reading and observation. Have to put back packs in free lockers. Hopefully you dont have to wait long for a locker to become available. I seemed to be the one in my group that they were always waiting for. I think Im a slow reader. An interesting place to visit with a self guided tour of the interior. The external courtyard and garden spaces offer a nice place to sit all year round Beautiful castle you can see all of the inside as well. Very nice experience... Guided tour recomended in order to learn some historical info! The gardens also is a must just for a walk! I definitely recommend buying tickets for the guided tour as you get access to areas that others don t, and the history you get to hear is amazing. Very glad I did it You can see some beautiful parts of Irish history, can easily get around without private tour. It doesnt take too long to see it all. Dublin Castle is a captivating mix of history and architecture. The castle offers visitors a glimpse into the countrys rich past. The medieval tower, State Apartments, and Chapel Royal showcase impressive craftsmanship. The beautifully landscaped gardens add a serene touch to the overall experience. Great to attend a gig in the hall or market in the courtyard. Guided tours gives you access to the underground viking area and old walls as well as the chapel which are interesting but depending on your interests may not be worth the extra price, Tour was large making it hard to ask questions and dont get alot of time to look at things that may interest you, Recommended the self guided instead We arrived at the opening without booking in advance, there was hardly anyone there. The interior of the castle is very beautiful and there are many objects and paintings to observe. It was very interesting Dublin Castle, nestled in the heart of Irelands capital city, is a historic site that encapsulates centuries of political, cultural, and architectural evolution. Initially constructed in the early 13th century under the orders of King John of England, the castle served as a symbol of English rule and authority in Ireland for centuries. Over the years, Dublin Castle underwent numerous transformations, reflecting the shifting dynamics of power and governance in Ireland. Initially designed as a military fortress to protect the Anglo-Norman colony in Dublin, the castle expanded over time to encompass residential quarters, administrative offices, and ceremonial spaces. One of the most notable features of Dublin Castle is its diverse architectural styles, which blend medieval, Georgian, and Victorian influences. The castles State Apartments, constructed during the Georgian era, boast elegant interiors adorned with intricate plasterwork, lavish furnishings, and exquisite artwork. These opulent spaces once housed the British Viceroy and served as the center of colonial administration in Ireland. Beyond its State Apartments, Dublin Castle is home to several other historically significant buildings and attractions. The Chapel Royal, dating back to the 19th century, showcases stunning Gothic Revival architecture and serves as a venue for religious ceremonies and cultural events. The Record Tower, the only surviving medieval tower of the original castle, offers visitors a glimpse into Dublins medieval past. Surrounding the castle is the Dubhlinn Gardens, a tranquil oasis that provides respite from the bustling city streets. These landscaped gardens feature lush greenery, manicured lawns, and historic monuments, creating a serene retreat in the heart of Dublin. Today, Dublin Castle stands as a symbol of Irelands complex history, serving as a testament to the resilience and endurance of its people. While no longer a seat of political power, the castle remains an important cultural landmark and a source of national pride. Visitors to Dublin Castle can explore its rich heritage, discover its architectural treasures, and reflect on the tumultuous history that has shaped modern Ireland. What a lovely breathtaking experience I had here. Everyone was so kind and friendly. The pictures dont do justice. Must see in person. Such a beautiful historic site."

54,Dublin Discovered Boat Tours,4.65,"We had a great time. We learned 1,000 years of Irish history in 45 minutes. Ryan & Captain Tony were amazing. This is a must when you visit Dublin! I decided to do the tour the day before folowing the canselation of a business meeting. Although the day was gloomy and the temperature was a bit cold the tour guide succeded in chearing up all people on board. It was a very nice experience. The tour was smooth and we viewed the city along the Liffey banks from the river point of view. We were provided with much and good information about the city history and the development of the Docklands area. The guide had a very good sence of houmor and kept balance not being insulting or vulgar. I really enjoyed the tour. The staff was very friendly and the tour was informative as well as funny. It was interesting. However, the tour was just about half an hour instead of 45 min. I hope this was a one-off due to the tide or similar. I do feel like we should have gotten some sort of explanation or an apology though. Our tour was cut short by 1/3... The tour was very interesting. A lot of Irish history in 45min. We had a good laugh with the guide! Would definitely recommend on a city trip! Visited on Had a great time with Gerry and Tony.  It was a fun experience with a beautiful view of the city from the river.  I also appreciate that Caitriona treated me very well via email in regard to scheduling my visit. A great Dublin experience. The boat stories were amazing, the guide was great! What really impressed me is this: they called us to tell that the place from where the boat was changed, but because we were distracted by the number format we did not answer and did now know that boat left from another place (river level issues). So, when we got to the kiosk and told the lady we do not see any boat, she explained what happened and proposed us to go on the next tour, 1h later, which was also the last one that day. Good place to eat recommendations too! Very easy going, natural, a good customer orientation and diplomacy. All my respects!   you really made a difference! Guide only in English, I didnt understand everything, especially the witticisms that made the passengers laugh. So-so. A translation with headphones, for example, would be a significant minimum for a tourist trip. Not very interesting for small children. Good for adults anyway It was fully guided tour and they did an awesome job...explained every bit of it very well... the historic significance of different bridges and other places as we sailed through... the view is beautiful from the Excellent way to see Dublin from the Liffey River. The tour guide was very knowledgeable of the history of Dublin.  I highly recommend this 45 minute tour. Booked last minute and Im happy I did. The guide and the captain were wholesome and funny. There were a lot of jokes and a lot information. Although the guide made some jokes about the British, so be prepared of your British;) The boat has windows in the roof so you can see everything right But would totally recommend and it was worth the 17 Was very enjoyable and very informative. In my opinion, it should have been a tad longer. I really liked the boat tour and strongly recommend it! We had a great guide that told so many fun and interestung stories about Dublin. If we ever come back to this beautiful city i would even do this tour a second time. Lovely boat tour. Friendly and welcoming staff who are full of knowledge. We pre-booked and would advise this as fully booked the day when we arrived. This was one of the more enjoyable river cruises we have been on. Our guide was knowledgeable and more important, funny!! Good tour for the money Ryan and Mark were great craic Only downside is its hard to take photos of the city with the small windows but has to be small to fit under the bridges Visited on Weekday Excellent river cruise with tour guide Rob. Some great facts and history about the area, definitely reccomend if your visiting Dublin. very nice Thoroughly enjoyed this boat trip up and down the liffey, the captain and tour guide were both really funny! Lots of interesting information about this amazing city too! Did this tour yesterday, Gerry was informative and entertaining, really enjoyable boat trip would recommend it Such a great tour. Sit back and enjoy the tour in comfort. 45 mins going up and down the river. Great views of the buildings and ships. Guide was very entertaining with loads of facts. Quick tour, but you get some good information in a short period of time, and see a lot of the main sites from the water. Fun guides! A great tour and very informative. Very much worth it Of little interest if you have already taken the bus tour... especially since there is no audio guide in French We really enjoyed this 45 minute River Liffey tour. Very comfortable seats, careful attention to safety, and knowledgeable, funny tour leader, Darrell (sp?). Good way to understand Dublin citys major monuments and key historical events. All OK, funny and nice diaries. Myself, my mom, little sister(all from Cork) and my boyfriend(from Croatia although red headed!) Did this tour on June 22nd when we were in Dublin for the Artic Monkeys concert(lets not talk about it  ). We were across the river and saw the boats so we did a quick Google and realised we had 5 minutes before a tour started so we RAN! Anyway, best spontaneous thing we did. The guy that sold us the tickets was so friendly and even though we were totally last minute,he made sure we got on and didnt make us feel like a nuisance for not booking ahead or showing up with seconds to spare(I know that was probably annoying because we were chancing it). We had no expectations but this is one of the best things to do in Dublin if youre visiting! Nice way to get a feel of things while relaxing in a boat and also get a really informative but funny history lesson that was really engaging and didnt make me feel like I was back in college getting a lecture   Daire/Darragh(sorry if Ive mispelled) was fantastic!!! So funny and knowledgeable he didnt miss a beat and although Im sure he could do this in his sleep, felt like a very naturally spoken tour instead of robotic like tours can sometimes feel. Mark was also fantastic and I love how he slowly circled the boat at points so we could all see everything! Recommend this 100%! Such a nice experience and being from Cork, Ive been to Dublin a lot and seen all of these sights before, but I definitely learned new things and wasnt bored for a second! Really cool facts that you may not find on Google or by simply walking around. Thank you lads, you all really made our morning and set us up for a great day Great experience! Mark and his colleague had so much knowledge and they told it in a very fun way! We got a lot to know about Dublin and Ireland! Thank you both :) Really enjoyed this tour. The captain and crew were very entertaining and knowledgeable. They gave us a flavor of the Dublin mindset, at least their perspective, as well as some interesting history. We are a family of Dubs and we found this cruise both informative and entertaining. Money well spent! Highly recommend. Very interesting to discover Dublin by boat. Capable and friendy guide. A nice trip on a boat up and down the Liffey. I do have to take the tourguide to task over the Coat of Arms on the Custom House. Yes, the Lion represents England, the Unicorn is Scotland and the Harp for Ireland but the reason Wales isnt represented isnt because its a Principality. Its because Wales originally was captured by the English Crown of Edward I and therefore became part of England. Subsequently, annexed by England in the 16th Century bringing it under English Law. And thats why Wales isnt represented in the Union Flag either but Ireland is as Saint Patricks Cross. (Union Flag as it stands was adopted 1801) Really interesting! Ive lived in Dublin for 3 years and done a bunch of tours so I didnt think I would learn anything But its actually really interesting! I never knew any of those stories or facts about the Liffey! The guy running it was pretty funny too! Would recommend! Great way to see (a small part of) the city. The tour guide is the best part. Historical, modern, and funny throughout. Stand up comedy on the water. Totally worth the price. Eoin was a great guide, engaging and funny. Would recommend. A really entertaining and informative boat tour down the Liffey. The tour guide was hilarious and had a lot of enthusiastic stories about the fine city of Dublin. A must see. The boat was very impressive too. Must visit if you are visiting Dublin. They explain the history of Dublin in 45 minutes, the crew is wonderful and keep the ride lively. Today I enjoyed a 45 minute Liffey Cruise guided by Eoin! Eoin was really engaging, funny, and helpful throughout. The boat is comfortable, warm and steady. This is a great way to discover some lesser known tales from the story of Dublin from an unusual perspective! The lads Jerry and Mark were lovely! Even let my 4 year old sit in the captains chair and beep the horn. Fun way to spend an hour around town We booked this Waterbus tour a few days after lock-down was lifted. The view from the waterline was great. Even as a dub it was great to see the changes on the Dublin skyline especially at the rejuvenated docklands. The Guide gave some great insight into Dublins history. #ramblingstampcollectors"
55,Dublin Greeters,5.0,nan
56,Dublin History and Culture Tour,5.0,"Fascinating insights into Irish History and Dublin  - We walked and talked for almost 3 hours with Keith, a proud Dubliner and knowledgeable historian. We definitely recommend his tour, especially at the start of a visit. He took us through Ireland s story from the NorseGaels to the progressive present. We not only learned about the Dublin sites, but also the language, history, culture, politics, struggles and successes of Ireland through the ages. In fact, now we know why an Irish speaker would struggle with the  th  in through. Keith explained the enormous influence of the Irish on the culture and language of the rest of the world. Our time with him flew by."
57,Dublin Portal,4.025,"A video link between Dublin and New York that feels like a slice of the future. Theres no sound but that makes you have to get more creative if you want to communicate across the Atlantic. Its a well chosen spot for Dublin as the Spire is in the immediate background. Best yet, this screen never turns off so it is on 24/7/365 so basically an infinite live stream. I visited the portal today, and it worked. There is a line on the ground - if you stay behind it, people in New York will see you completely. If you come too close to the portal, only the top of your head will be visible (so we were told by a friendly guy who seemed to be something like an overseer). Its a fun activity. Very cool, it shows us what technology can do nowadays, the people on the other side were very nice. 10/10 if youre visiting you should go. Spectacular place, and very good for connecting people across the world. Very well built. Make sure you stand in the visible area when you communicate with New York. Its not how its built, its the people on the other side that make it special. Cool idea, but in practice, its a large free face time which give the opportunity to some who do not know how to behave in public to do their nonsense Its a nice idea to connect people around the world, but for me it actually felt a bit boring because the people in New York seemed to do not care at all about the portal. Its a video conference from Dublin to New York. We cannot communicate with them by gestures, not by words, they cannot hear us Very exciting idea behind it, even if many non-tech-believers don t consider it serious, or some people don t respect it. It has a future in it. I consider it very interesting and also important for Ireland. This advancing country. This portal is connecting people. Very good! You should build one in Moscow and Washington! Enjoyed it a lot. This is amazing I was in Dublin for the weekend from the Netherlands heard about on social media and finally saw it Its a magical screen where you can see people around New York City. It is a wonderful experience. Everyone Should visit once. 10/10 experience, would and will go again, according to my friend the worlds most expensive facetime Fun experience connecting two iconic cities iconic landmarks Lots of rock, paper, scissors happening Good times! Visited on cool addition to the city. place was crowded but not crowded enough that you can t maneuver your way to the front. would recommend stopping by if your in the city. Cool concept but new York wasnt up yet so they was only a few people Dublin needs to provide fun signs like new York was holding up. It was really cool. We are from New York and to see New York in the middle of Dublin made me thankful for technology and how it was made to connect people. Exciting connection between two vibrant cities Would be neat to put a long trestle table on both sides and do a massive july barbie. Its not been that great since it was installed Anytime its on media or the news, it isnt good. Feel this is just more money wasted Visited on Weekday The video quality is very good, we were able to see people in New York very clearly The portal is relatively new and had its issues to start with but was great to wave to people on the other side of the Atlantic. Baby welcome to the Party! (Verse 1) Yo, its the Dublin Portal, peepin into New York, North Earl Street where the vibes never short, Pop Smoke holdin it down in the Big Apple, But in Dublin, we got our own rap battle. (Chorus) Dublin Portal, seein through the distance, Connectin worlds, no resistance, From Ireland to New York, we keep it real, Dublin Portal, its the deal. (Adlibs) Yeah, yeah, you know what it is, Dublin Portal, makin moves, never miss, Pop Smoke lookin down, showin love, North Earl Street, reppin from above. (Verse 2) Through the Portal, we see the city lights, New York to Dublin, its a beautiful sight, Pop Smokes legacy, livin on strong, In the Portals gaze, we all belong. (Chorus) Dublin Portal, seein through the distance, Connectin worlds, no resistance, From Ireland to New York, we keep it real, Dublin Portal, its the deal. (Adlibs) Yeah, yeah, one time for Pop Smoke, Dublin Portal, where dreams evoke, North Earl Street, holdin it down, In the Portals view, we wear the crown. (Outro) Dublin Portal, bridgin gaps with ease, From New York to Ireland, feel the breeze, Pop Smokes spirit, forever alive, In the Dublin Portal, we thrive. I tried to go inside the portal but the Gardai didnt let me, even though I had the tourist visa for America and the passport with me. There was no one that flashed hence the one star rating. Very disappointing. It s exactly what they say it is. It s a zoom call on a massive circle lol. It s fun to meet up with friends. Its interesting and nice to see people in another country Thank you for showing who you really were with the 9/11 stunt. No American should give Dublin their time or tourist dollars. Unique video connection to New York. Love the concept. I wish they closes a little later I tried to get through the portal, but I was stopped by the force field, and ended up being dragged away by the gardai even though I had my passport with me - would be one star, but I saw a girl flashing me from New York This is worth a visit if you are in town. Very cool concept Interesting concept, first time I see this. Cool idea but losses its edge after 2.5 seconds Cool concept but why is it not 24/7? As the website indicates Initially the portal seemed like great fun, however the novelty has worn off quickly and it just seems like a massive waste of money and bad pr. About what you d expect for a large video call with no audio to another country Why are the Yanks crying about misbehaviour hahahahaha I think its very funny Disgraceful as People were showing 9/11 to the NYC side Wow its a introduction of future"
58,Dublin Tour Guide,4.95,"One of the best tours ever.  Ciaran is a true student of history and could put the sites in the context of events of the time.  His knowledge of Irish history was matched only by his charm and easy demeanor.  Just a great day and I can highly recommend Ciaran to anyone that wants to understand what makes Ireland Ireland. We had a lovely time with Leonor. She gave us a great overview of Irish history, James Joyce and Dublin in general and adapted the tour perfectly to our wishes. The tour with Leonor really added something special to our stay in Dublin. We would definitely recommend! There arent enough words to describe how incredible this tour company is. Ultimate Day in Dublin! James Joyce, General post office,  book of Kells and old library at trinity college, national gallery (where we saw works by Keating, Van Gogh, Picasso, and Monet), first Irish fish and chips at Lincoln Inn, dublin castle,  Irish cheeses from a cheese monger to pair with beers at the oak!! Ended the evening at an Irish pub with live music of course. Garvan was an amazing guide and made us feel truly special. We did the new Irish History Museum Tour with John Caffrey when we were in Dublin.  I have used Dublin Tour Guide before on previous trips to Dublin.  This tour was fantastic.  Johns knowledge of Irish History and art was extensive with respect to significant historical events that shaped Ireland.  I highly recommend Dublin Tour Guide and this tour when you are in Dublin. This was a great find. I cant recommend this tour highly enough. We went on the pub crawl tour with our amazing and knowledgeable tour guide Brendan (not OLeary) who walked us through the pubs of Dublin. I would go again tomorrow if I knew Brendan would be the one giving the tour. Four very different pubs that showcase all the best that Dublin has to offer. My wife and I took a tour of Dublin with Garvan. He was extremely knowledgeable and easy to talk to. Garvan took us to major locations/sites such as Trinity College and The Book of Kells but also gave us multiple options along the way so it felt like our needs were being catered to. We had never been to Dublin before so this was a fantastic way to learn about the rich history and culture. We highly recommend this tour. In August 2019, we took what turned out to be truly the trip of a lifetime and packed our bags, headed for England, Scotland,  Wales, and especially to Ireland.  We were on a Grand European Tours, with only a day and half in Dublin.  My husband insisted, for my sake, that we book a Dublin walking tour,  so we started looking for recommendations. Dublin Tour Guide, particularly Garvan Rusche, was recommended, and what a wonderful decision! Garvan was so passionate about Irish history, and was willing to work with us, listening to what we wanted to see and making it happen! Seeing The Book of Kells was the highlight of the trip,  as well as just walking around the city, soaking up Garvans knowledge and his take on life in Ireland!  Dublin Tour guide - super highly recommended. Great tour for our student. It made Dublin even more interesting and beautiful. Great humour, nice locations and good time. Recommended When our travel agent booked our party of 7 for a 5 hour walking tour of Dublin, all of us were like  ugh, that s long  but within 5 minutes of meeting Garvan we realized that this tour may end up being the highlight of the trip. Knowledgeable about ALL things Ireland & Dublin, from history to music to beer, we honestly could not have asked for a better experience. We had the best time & cannot recommend Garvan & Dublin Tour Guides enough! We did the three hour walking tour of Dublin, and we certainly were not disappointed! Jack was our guide and he did a magnificent job showing us all of the obvious things in Dublin, and some of the less obvious. He was so knowledgeable and very nice. He always had an answer to our question, no matter how crazy our question was! I would definitely use this tour company again. Thank you! We had a great experience with Garvan! Even though being a quite large and diverse group Garvan made it fun and enjoyable for everyone during the Sights & Pints tour. We learned a lot about Dublin, the Irish, Irish culture and history while sipping great beer. Definitely can recommend for everyone looking for a different and rewarding tour guide experience. I am sure we only scratched the surface and would dive deeper in subsequent tours. Our Dublin tour with Garvan was perhaps the best tour weve ever had.  We have enjoyed a number of different private tours in various European cities, and our 1 and 1/2 days with Garvan was as authentic and engaging as weve ever experienced.  His deep knowledge of Irish history, culture, architecture, and politics blended seamlessly with his sharp wit, infectious sarcasm, and singing!  He has an innate sense of timing and pace, and anticipated our needs for breaks, or food, and could recommend convenient, close places for us to grab a coffee or stop for lunch.  He is flexible for special requests, and tailored our time with him around our interests.  We wish we could return and book him again!  Book him now, and it will be the best planning choice you make for your Ireland trip! June 2018 my wife and I did a full day Dublin private walking tour with Carl Jackson. It was outstanding. Five Star. This was our first day in Ireland on a 30-day trip around the island. Carl was well informed, articulate, professional, listened to questions and answered so that no question was off-limits. This was a priceless introduction to Ireland s history and culture to start our 30-day journey. Excellent start to our Ireland vacation, thanks to Carl Jackson and Dublin Tour Guide. All we can say is if youre looking for a good time and an excellent tour and history lesson of Dublin, call Garvan!  We signed on for the three hour walking tour and were not disappointed.  First of all, Garvan is a great guy.  Funny, personable and extremely knowledgeable about Irish & Dublin history.  Our group included my parents and three 20+ year olds and he made the whole experience entertaining and worth every Euro!  We ended up our tour having lunch together and hes just that kind of guy you want to be around.  Thanks, Garvan, from all the Sheehys.  We had a great time and it was a wonderful introduction to Dublin. I cant say enough about our walking tour of Dublin.  Garvan was such a delight.  His knowledge of Ireland, mixed in with lots of laughs was the best.  I would highly recommend Garvan for your walking guide in Dublin. The Dublin tour guide was very informative, fun and useful. John Caffery, our tour guide did a very good job showing us the different buildings and places that represents Ireland history. It was also really funny. We had a very interesting tour walking with the guide i Dublin. We were told many exciting storys about the history of Dublin and saw  famous attractions. 3 hours i long - but I recomend it. Garvan is the best tour guide on the planet! He is funny and interesting. We took a five-hour tour (nearly all) and learned a lot about the Irish culture and Dublin. Positive Quality, Professionalism, Value Garvan is an experienced and gifted guide (i.e. fun personality), and highly recommend if you want to learn about Dublins unique history (plus the fun bits of today). Dont try to save money with another guide, just book Garvans tour as soon as possible! Thank you Garvan! - Dan and Anastasia We had a fantastic walking tour of Dublin led by Cathal. He is knowledgeable, fun, lyrical and helped guide us so our time in Dublin was well spent. The 5-hour Dublin tour with Garvan was unbelievable. An absolute highlight of our short trip. Hope to be back and check out his pub tour next! Garvan has been so helpful throughout the whole process of my booking. He was ever so responsive and professional. I was all booked for a local and private tour around Dublin and Garvan was all set to personalize it for me. Sadly, my tour had to be cancelled last minute, as my travel dates back to England changed. Despite the refund policy, Garvan was so considerate and understanding of the situation, which would have caused me so much stress if I had not been able to cancel the tour and have my money refunded. Garvan kept me informed throughout the whole process and I was refunded my money so quickly. I really appreciate the professionalism and integrity of this company and would definitely recommend. Hopefully I can come back to Ireland and follow through with the tour. Thank you Garvan :) John was an amazing guide!  I really enjoyed the tour he gave me and was very fascinated by his knowledge of the history of Dublin! Garvan was amazing! 5 hour guide for a family of four (2 boys ages 9&14) Garvan has been the highlight of our Ireland trip! You havent seen Dublin till youve seen it with Garvon. Passionate, extremely knowledgeable and extremely kind and fun. He works with you and caters to your interests so he can take care of your personal needs. I learned and saw so much and was only there a couple days. Honestly I would come back just to hangout with Garvon. Please, book him. You wont regret a second. We had a lovely time with garvan. My mother doesnt drink at all but garvan has a deep knowledge of different beers and whiskeys. Got a non drinker to drink with that expertise. Fun times and fun conversation. Amazing tour. This guys really knows his stuff. His enthusiasm for his work really shows and its infectious. His knowledge of Irish history and Dublin was astounding. 5* I highly recommended this tour. Excellent guide. Passionate, informative, fun and conveyed a love of the city!  Extremely fortunate to have him as our guide. Wonderful experience. Wished it was longer hours I very much enjoyed the tour, provided by tourguide John who was very enthousiastic and told a lot of great background stories. Highly recommended! Austin was a very fine fellow and an excellent guide John was a great tour guide! Thanks! Good Maravillosa experiencia con nuestro guia dublines. Gran comunicador y conocedor de contextos socio politicos y economicos que aportaron a la vista de Dublin aspectos muy interesantes. Nos facilito tambien un QR con informacion para tenerlo como material de consulta siempre. A destacar su interes por las personas del grupo y por supuesto sus recomendaciones mas sinceras. Algo que tambien valoramos mucho fueron los consejos para descubrir lugares a los que se pueden ir viajando facilmente en tren/autobus desde Dublin para conocer mas en profundidad el turismo autoctono y tan caracteristico de Irlanda. nan nan nan nan nan nan"
59,Dublin Tourism Centre,4.5,"Dublin city offering a unique experience and stunning city views both day and night, We were very well informed about visits to do in Dublin in both English and French. It s a real plus to go there. Nobody spoke French! Very friendly staff, everything was perfect We hebben 48 uur geboekt voor de Big Bus. Je kunt dan 2 dagen lang genieten van deze hop on hop off service + je krijgt er een gratis avondtour en citytour erbij. Wat deze bussen uniek maakt: het live commentaar van de buschauffeurs. James is een echte kletser. Hij weet veel te vertellen over de stad en met zijn vele anekdotes krijgt hij de lachers op zijn hand. Anne wist ook zeer veel te vertellen over de stad. Tevens zong ze onderweg passende liedjes ! Jammer genoeg vertelde Gerry niks live: hij liet een bandje met tekst horen. Gerry was tevens zeer geirriteerd richting verkeer. De medewerkers bij het office centre waren zeer vriendelijk en behulpzaam. De medewerker bij busstop 1 (Collin) was zeer aardig en vertelde graag over Dublin. Sehr freundlich, sehr hilfsbereit. Danke! Muito prestavel o servico. Iedere dag open. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan"
60,Dublin Tourist Information Centre Barnardo Square,4.475,"Cesar was our information guide. His Knowledge is outstanding. He gave us heaps of ideas to see lots of Ireland on our road trip from Australia.  Thank you I was so happy to find the real tourist information ! Cesar and his colleague were really nice and gave me information that I needed about transport. They were patient and clear. I  recommend. St Patricks Day parade goes right past the building with a big square for people to gather and enjoy the festivities. 2 double decker busses blocking the view reserved for media only kids having to watch the parade through the windows of the bus while the busses remained pretty much unoccupied. sacrifice for many to favor the few. Its a terrible shame this is allowed to happen. Just perfect. Very very well helped by the two members of staff (the Irish woman and the Belgian with long hair). Help with pleasure, kindness and valuable advice! The best pleac i visited if you like crowded area and best restaurant specially Nando Cesar was such an absolute   gem to come upon.  He provided so much great information to us as first timers to Dublin.  He even told us where the closest ATM was so that we could finally get some Euros.  He was so kind, helpful and professional.  He really loves his job and that just has set the tone for our trip and of the people of Ireland    in general! I stopped by the info center at the start of my short Irish trip, and I was greeted warmly by the staff. Cesar was not just kind but also extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He gave me paper maps in my language for Dublin and the other Irish cities I wanted to explore. Plus, he dished out tons of cool suggestions for Dublins must-see spots and some hidden gems, all while answering my questions about the city. Hes a real Irish expert, and his passion for the place shines through in his words. Needless to say, I followed his advice and thoroughly loved my Irish holiday! I look forward to coming back sometime in the future! The staff are absolutely lovely kind and make you feel so at ease. Maps hop on tours and public transport They made sure we get value for money. That are a credit to the organisation. Well done kind regards B. I was looking for specific information: routes and places to travel with my pet and theater shows for the month of September. They recommended me to visit the official sites of Visit Dublin and Irish Rail. I had already done it and there were thinhs I coudnt understand thats why I  went to the office!  A waste of time. Staff not especially helpful. Lots of leaflets though. We were looking for information on Buses to get around town and do the visits we had planned. Cesar, who speaks French, then recommended a transport application and looked with us at the city map to advise us on a route and additional places to visit Very good advice! My girlfriend and I called into this office at the start of our Irish holiday. We got excellent information about not just Dublin but Ireland and the Wild Atlantic Way which helped us have a fantastic holiday as we explored. We also got German information leaflets and maps which was a real surprise. Thank you to Cesar and the team here for all the assistance. I recently called this tourist information center while visiting friends in Ireland for advice and help about Dublin and in particular the more little-known aspects of its history. I received first class service in this office from the lovely Cesar who gave me excellent information, maps and the most important tips on unique and off the beaten track places. He was super helpful and a real encyclopedia of Dublin life. AAA service Really amazing service and great tips here last week when I visited this Centre with some French colleagues who were visiting Dublin and needed planning for their weekend -  got exceptional advice in both English and French and great tips from Cesar who works here - a top class service and a staff member that could not be more helpful and exuded energy - Highly recommend popping in here to all visitors to Dublin Very friendly and helpful staff. Staff did not seem too interested in helping. Asked about things to do in the city or nationwide and they didnt even speak to me, just grabbed a handful of leaflets and gave them to me. I could have done that research online, but I was there looking for personal recommendations or recommendations made based on my interests. Poor Really lovely to see a normal tourist information with leaflets! Lots of options and staff are lovely Went to the visitors Centre to find some information about sights around Dublin. They helped us, but they didnt have maps to give us and didnt have printers to print out instructions. ..they didnt even have paper.  Best they could come up with was the back of a business card.  Would expect better for the tourist office of the capital. The place has now moved onto Suffolk St, just a few steps away, and has great interactive screens all around. Its very new and tech, and they have plenty of free thorough guide books for every part of Ireland! Google maps has the wrong location for this, but they were very helpful! There were 2 tours that were recommended by here that were the highlight of the trip.  I definitely recommend asking about them here.  They were kind enough to contact the company, book our tours, and set up pick points that were closest to our accommodations. Just fantastic.  I dont think there was any upcharge or anything for them to do this for us. There are also a lot of free maps and its a good place to just ask questions about the city or local events. Incredibly helpful staff, definitely visit if youre looking for something to do. Particular mention should go to (I think) Susan, who recommended EXACTLY the right itinerary for me and my mother, and was just fantastic and lovely! No problem to get help. Was easy to get in contact with the employees and gave more info about places that are not so populair as the main attractions. The official Ireland Visitors center was excellent.  We spoke to Joe and he gave us great information that has been very helpful in navigating around Dublin. This is the only official tourist location South of the Liffy. The others are on OConnell and at the airport. You can come here to book tours, get info, and find accommodations. They call places directly for you for free. There is no cost to have tourist info help you. Also, theyre all very nice people. The best tourist advice in town, start your trip here. Grab yourself a visitors leap pass to use all the public transport and save yourself some legwork. Friendly and knowledgeable staff with no agenda except that you enjoy your stay. To see as soon as you arrive in Dublin, you will find all the visits to do in the surrounding area as well as discount vouchers for these. The only criticism I could make is a lack of French speaking staff but I may have had the wrong day. Very helpful staff. Went their to collect my city pass, totally worth it. 10 euros and you get unlimited bus/metro/train access for 24 hours Very helpful. Booked while in the office for what we had planned. Great friendly service and went out of there way to help. The only official tourist information centre in Dublin (all the others are unofficial and just want to sell you tours their company runs). Staff were very knowledgeable, there are a wide range of leaflets, free Wi-Fi and touch screen displays to help you make the most of your visit to Dublin. The staff was very friendly and when I went there was no wait, however they did not sell transport cards for children and they were out of stock of transport cards for 72 hours. An awesome tourist information centre with all sorts of Information & Maps & Guide booklets and all the public transportation & bicycles and many more things to know....its the first thing to visit when you are in Dublin before you plan your day out there exploring. Grafton street, The visit to the Grafton pedestrian street is nice. Lots of shops. At the end of the afternoon, street artists come and bring some entertainment. On the other hand, in the evening when going to find a restaurant, its more gloomy. Associations helping the homeless set up stands to give them food. The action is very commendable but perhaps it should be done elsewhere than in the busiest street in Dublin because we lose our sense of security, especially since the local police are completely absent. Good walk We met a wonderful welcoming person! Who listens to tourists and is very patient. I recommend it ! We had the information but the map is poor in obvious tourist information The most helpful tourist office I have ever experienced. Lovely people. If its your first time in Dublin, i recommend this place first. Here, you can gather lots of infirmation about what Dublin has to offer In 2017, you can pose with Molly Malone. Very helpful staff, you get some special tourist leap cards here (public transport ticket for Dublin). The friendliest and most helpful tourist office I have ever experienced. Friendly and well informed staff Helpful staff and a ton of free flyers and maps that you can use for your stay in the city"
61,Dublin Tourist Information Centre O'Connell Street,4.775,"Staff like the welcoming, caring and smiling Irish people, I had an excellent stay and I would come back!    Small mention of Caesars sympathy, which deserves to be highlighted.... Super nice people, very welcoming. I had all the information I needed. I will come back without hesitation Very helpful. You can purchase you tourist leap card from here Very competent staff attentive to tourists and very friendly Dublin was a great place to visit, beautyful places, lots of histories and very kind people! Wow, wow, wow. 5 stars for Min Lin s professionalism, clarity, and kindness. Not only did she give me maps with everything I needed, she also gave me interesting facts and pieces of advice for my upcoming Wicklow Way hike. Thanks to her, my journey around Ireland is already a A LOT smoother. My first impression of Ireland is very positive, thanks to her. Welcomed by a young French-speaking man named Cesar. A marvel... both for the smile, the friendliness and the perfect advice for our research... Visit to free monuments and unmissable places and pubs with local people. Thanks to him. We had a great day and he had a lot to do with it. Very helpfull good service.great job Thanks Picked up a Leap Card.  Ruth was super helpful and friendly.  Enjoyed chatting with her.  She made sure I had exactly what I needed and gave me some recommendations of local places to see.  Used my card to tour the city by local transit buses.  Drivers were all really nice too.  Buses are very clean. Excellent service, staff are extremely helpful,  especially  Min Lin.   She helped me sort out bus card with patience and kindness. Thanks again x Customer Service on point! Cant not say a negative thing about this place! The lovely lady that assisted me was absolutely lovely!!!! Theyre all so lovely and knowledgeable, if you need any questions asked head on down and theyll help you!!!! Those present are all very friendly and try to respond as best they can to requests, however diverse they may be. But if they are more unusual, they are not all able to respond to our request and refer us to another, larger tourist office. A beautiful tourist station that lacks one thing: The start/finish sign to the Wild Atlantic Way.  Went from North to South by bicycle with beautiful WAW representation along the way and then it fell off completely coming into Kinsale.  Had to hunt this spot down after 2500km!  A simple wave sign extended over the door would do it.  Wonder if that golf course that controls historical site #1 with no entry is behind this huge mistake? I came here to buy a Leap Card and the people here were very helpful. Lots of info on tours in Dublin and other areas of Ireland. Easy to get to as it is in the middle of the city. Jean was especially helpful. A very knowledgeable and passionate person whos live for Ireland and the area definitely came across. People working there are very helpful and friendly.  If u wanna see Dublin I would recommend Hoop on bus! Its cheap for travelers very friendly and nice lady who helped us with buying the right leap visitor card Excellent service and staff super friendly. Cant recommend highly enough Very helpful to find out about the tourist attractions. Specially Galway and west part of the country. Friendly and helpful staff. Fast help and lots of informations. Can recommend! Called for the Dublin leap card the staff very helpful plenty of leaflets on what to see and do Really helpful, needed guidance on top on top off tours and helped us no problem The staff are very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful Very welcoming agents and very good advice. Absolutely incredible tour to the cliffs of moher and our guide val was absolutely incredible. Girls were very friendly and provided all the needed info A good place to understand various tours and trip details while in Ireland Very useful and the bus tour of Dublin is good The staff was very helpful. Leap card. Lovely service. Many information. Great spot for all your vital tourist information Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful Staff very friendly and helpful A huge centre with reception and literature on both southern Ireland and Northern Ireland. It is a very helpful place Very friendly and helpful Nice and helpful people Just great Could be better Well informed"

63,Dublin Zoo,4.725,"Dublin Zoo offers a delightful experience for visitors of all ages. From the moment we entered, it was evident that the zoo is meticulously maintained, with immaculate pathways and well-kept enclosures. The cleanliness of the facilities added to the overall enjoyment of our visit. While exploring the zoo, we encountered a variety of fascinating animals. However, we were disappointed that we couldnt catch a glimpse of some of the more elusive species such as the lion, snow leopard, and tiger. Despite this, we were thrilled to see magnificent creatures like the giraffes, elephants, and California sea lions. Their habitats appeared spacious and enriched, providing a comfortable environment for the animals. The highlight of our visit was observing the playful antics of the giraffes and the graceful movements of the elephants. The California sea lion exhibit was also captivating, offering insight into the lives of these charismatic marine mammals. Overall, our experience at Dublin Zoo was enjoyable, especially on a day with good weather. Although we missed out on seeing a few animals, the cleanliness of the zoo and the opportunity to witness captivating species made it a memorable outing. We look forward to returning in the future to explore more of what Dublin Zoo has to offer. Big fan of the big enclosures for animals. For sure the biggest Ive seen in any zoo so far. This however does mean that its often hard to find out even see the animals, especially from up close. Wouldnt recommend going here if youre going because you like photography and are looking to get some cool shots because theres little options for free shots without (dirty) glass or wired fences. The bigger enclosures also mean that Theres not as many different animals as in other zoos, and that was a small disappointment. Overall good experience, but could be more interactive, and maybe at some places possible to see the animals better. Loved this zoo! Large and full of some great animals with most being very visible. You can bet very close to the animals which is very nice! The only thing I didnt prefer were the enclosures in the middle where you have to backtrack to get back to where there are additional animals to see. Dublin Zoo has a lot to see and do for everyone! It is a large zoo with a huge variety of animals, ranging from Californian Sea Lions (not seals people, sea lions) red pandas, Asian elephants, both African and Asian lions to a basic petting zoo! Great place to go and Id recommend buying your tickets beforehand. Plenty of food places dotted around, water bottle refil stations and facilities. A wonderful well established and cared for zoo. Put on your walking shoes as this is a very big zoo and well worth a visit, you can spend the whole day there. It s beautiful.  Great value for money! The restaurants have great food and there s plenty of places to stop, rest and view the great many animals from around the world. Had been there with my girlfriend to experience zoo after a decade. The zoo was amazing to be honest and the way they have kept it for the animals is brilliant. Every animal have their space to walk and move freely along with dedicated areas to come closer to audience separated by glass walls. I personally liked Red Pandas and Sea Lions the most. We have lunch at Meerkat restaurant alongside watching Meerkat and was an amazing day for us. This place is highly recommended and a must visit for solo, couple and especially for families. I am sure everyone will enjoy it while having a healthy walk inside the zoo. Had a great visit to the zoo, managed to see most of the animals while we were there.  Felt the environment was really good, lots of space for the animals to relax and enjoy. Credit to all involved. Would love to visit again sometime. Keep up the good work. A little cooler today ,so not as much activity as normal. A great spot to put the day in..plenty for the kids , coffee bars , vending machines,  loads of places to sit and chill ..you can even have a puff in the smoking areas . This place is wonderful!    We love to go there. The smell of flowers and trees give you the impresion that you are walking in a real jungle. The ways you can see the animals are very good. Even the little farm farm is so nice for kids. Such a good place to spend a day! Wonderful zoo with fantastic choice of animals to see, well mapped and friendly staff. Only down sides were parking wasnt sign posted and it was a warm day and no ice cream stands open. Apart from that we loved our visit and would visit again. Fantastic value for money as well! Pic added of my favourite Fublin Zoo offers a fantastic day out for the whole family, with an array of fascinating animals and friendly staff. The diverse collection of animals is well-cared for and provides visitors with an educational and enjoyable experience. The staff are knowledgeable, passionate, and always on hand to answer questions and provide insight into the animal kingdom. Plus, with affordable ticket prices, Dublin Zoo makes it easy for everyone to enjoy a day of adventure and discovery without breaking the bank. It was a great trip, I love giraffes, and they apparently have an ok sized enclosure, compared to some other zoos Ive seen, the animals generally seem fit and healthy, the monkey enclosure is huge, it looks like they have a good portion of forest for them to live. I took an animal care course and did behavioral observation work with African wild dogs, and they seemed fine and healthy, we didnt observe abnormal behavior. Its definitely worth the visit. Inside the zoo there is a restaurant, it is a little expensive, but the food is very good. We finally had a day with no rain during our holiday and decided to spend it at the Zoo. We purchased our tickets online the day of and picked an entry time. We walked right up to the ticket agent, scanned the barcodes and gained access. The zoo has a lot of animals and I appreciate that their habitats are pretty large compared to those we have in the US. We saw giraffes,zebra, sea lions, a variety of monkeys, red pandas, lions, tigers, snow leopards, elephants, birds, penguins, wolves and more. Luckily, all of the animals were out and active on this day. They did start to bring all the animals in around 15:45 especially in the Africa area. Although not bad, they could use some updates here and there. We saw cracked glass on several exhibits and lots of dirty hand prints on the windows. They need more signage and the lion exhibit is misplaced on the map. They had food options but don t sell alcohol on the premise. Overall it was a lovely afternoon. Definitely recommend a trip to the zoo if you have the time. Visiting Dublin Zoo on a Friday day trip from Cork was an unforgettable experience for my family and me. From the moment we stepped through the gates, we were immersed in a world of wonder and excitement. The zoos sprawling grounds are beautifully landscaped, providing a natural habitat for the diverse range of animals housed here. What truly stood out was the dedication of the staff, who were not only knowledgeable about the animals but also passionate about conservation efforts. We enjoyed engaging with them during feeding times and educational talks, gaining insights into the importance of wildlife preservation. The zoo also offers numerous amenities, including cafes and picnic areas, making it easy to relax and recharge between adventures. Overall, our day at Dublin Zoo was filled with laughter, learning, and lasting memories. Its a must-visit destination for families seeking a fun and educational outing. My wife and I spent several hours exploring this magnificent facility in beautiful Phoenix Park in Dublin.  Amazing beauty and serenity amidst the hubbub of Dublin.  Very well maintained facility and informative displays make this an informative outing for all ages. Bought tickets online and got 1 free tix for Father s Day. I suggest you sign you for their newsletters for updates on vouchers. :) It was an easy almost 3-hour zoo escapade! Omw!!!... From start to finish,it truly was an amazing zoo,the aray of animals they have,and the viewing points of each animal,in their enclosed,is second to none!!!!. It took us 3 hrs,and we havent finished yer,we going bk down again to complete it. If you book online its cheaper, you definitely will not be disappointed. Class zoo in my home city. The work the staff do is incredible. Friendly staff everywhere lots of work carried out from my previous trip. My kids 8&10 love the zoo. Nice to see all the animals out as well. Food is a bit pricy but worth the visit. Right in the heart of the city. Family ticket cottbus  62 euro. Its cheaper than a cinema ticket lately. Go check it out and hats off to all the staff Excellent Zoo, well laid out and large comfortable enclosures for the animals, cafe had a great choice, overall a great day out and reasonably priced. Very cool. I was impressed with the amount of animals. We went earlier in the morning which was nice since as we were leaving a bunch of younger kids and teens were very loudly showing excitement. They have very nice enclosures with the ability to view the animals if they are inside their shelters. I loved the seals and all the information provided on the signs. Very cool zoo. Its a well designed and maintained zoo! Great variety of animals. We ended up having sunny weather and most of the animals were out which was lovely. Dublin zoo is a wonderful place to visit for anyone who loves animals and nature. The zoo is home to over 400 animals from around the world, including endangered and rare species. The zoo is also very well maintained, with spacious and naturalistic habitats for the animals. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, and they offer various talks and events throughout the day. The zoo also supports conservation projects and breeding programmes, so your ticket helps to protect wildlife and their habitats. Dublin zoo is a great attraction for families, couples, and solo travellers, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun and educational day out in Dublin. Lovely place to visit, very clean and plenty of facilities, great variety of animals and can be seen wither they are housed or outside, you will not be disappointed. Went to see the Wild Lights this evening, was amazing, fantastic job done. Lovely walk around the zoo with different themes for each walkway. Only negative was the parking arrangements, not enough parking which meant driving up and down the park waiting on space to become available in one of the car parks. Visited on Quite possible the best zoo Ive been too! The animal all looked happy and healthy, you could see pretty much all the animals, the enclosures were clean and well thought out. All around amazing! Fantastic day out at the zoo as usual. Gorgeous place to walk around, grab a coffee and look at some of the fabulous animals. The animals were out and active. They have great food I recommend the chicken tenders and chips. I always go to the gift shops and i was please with some stuff for adults and I got a nice hoodie in a 3xl so they do have a wide range of sizes. All of the staff were soooo nice and helpful. 10/10 I recommend and will go back. First time visit on chill seasons daily , is good atmosphere nd more calm . But some restaurant is close , probably weekends or public holiday in summer much better coz all restaurants is all open . Also about ticket recommended take unlimited purchase for one years is much better cost . Theres available playground for children, Lovely Zoo will be back to visit against friendly staff Beautiful zoo with a few places to eat and drink along the way. Lots of diverse animals and though a few inclines, relatively easy on the feet. One of the best zoos I ve ever been. Beautiful animals who are all well cared for. The staff were helpful and the exhibitions were interesting This is one of the best zoos Ive been to! Excellent habitat design and they animals have lots of room to roam, theyre always expanding Perfect day spot especially with children. There are a lot of animals here for children to get familiarised with. There are cafes within the zoo premises which makes it convenient for a day out plan. As an adult, I felt bad seeing animals in captivity. But I am sure they must be well taken care of. Dublin Zoo surpassed my expectations with its diverse range of animals. The enclosures are spacious and well-maintained, providing a comfortable environment. A must-visit for families and nature enthusiasts alike. I have wanted to visit Dublin Zoo lights for years, but unfortunately, I have always missed it. This year, we booked early and got tickets.  Such a beautiful experience,  to disappear for a couple of hours into a place of magic. Cant wait till next year. P.s. would love to see some live characters walking around in light up costumes What is there to not love about Dublin zoo. The day was lovely. It rained twice but we didnt care. It was great to see all the animals. We got very lucky and got to see the big cats up close. And on a second trip around many of the other animals came out. The staff were delightful. The shop was great couldnt help but buy a snow leopard toy. Unfortunately arrived when they were taking down their light festival lights meaning there was a lot of disruption . We visited in the morning on a week day therefore not many of the shops were open only the main cafe and gift shop . The animals AMAZING . So much space good quality enrichment and all very interested in us (maybe this was because it was so empty ) deffo recommend a weekday  morning ! Dublin Zoo Wild Lights were amazing. Crowds were well managed by staff upon entry but it does get very busy inside as various groups catch up on each other. An excellent family experience though. Went on a weekend with kids, family and friends to see the Dublin Zoo lights for the first time. Was lucky to have a good weather, didnt rain and wasnt much cold. The lights and shows were truly magical and mystical. Seemed like a wonderland. Kids enjoyed and loved it so much. Tips: Try to avoid weekends which gets very crowded. Had to park 1.2km away from the venue, so try to be early on the weekends. Will highly recommend and revisit next year. very fun day out!! all of the wild lights decor was still up when we visited which had some fun photo ops. one downside is that a lot of the food outlets seem to have shorter opening hours than displayed on the website - gift shop closed quite early too. Excellent Zoo! Wonderful day out. So many animals who were so inquisitive & interactive, clearly very happy animals! Thank you for a wonderful visit."
64,Dublin city walks,5.0,"Top notch walking tour of Dublin with Liam!  He is very knowledgeable and pleasant.  Superb overview of Dublin history and culture.  We explored Dublin s Viking, Norman, and Georgian past capped by Irish liberation in 2.5 hours.  I look forward to returning for a literary tour. Liam is a fantastic tour guide! My husband and I really enjoyed his literary tour of Dublin. Liam Greene is an excellent, interesting, humorous guide. Highly recommend!"
65,Dublinia,4.7,"Great place for a brief retrospect and reflection of Dublin and its colorful history. They put hard work into the setup, and its really worth visiting. Theres a neat little coffee shop within, with very friendly staff. As a side note, the place has an elevator and is wheelchair accessible. This museum offers a fascinating journey through Dublins Viking and Medieval history. The exhibits are highly interactive and engaging, making it perfect for both adults and children. Dublinia is a must-visit for anyone interested in history or looking for an educational and fun day out in Dublin. Additionally, they have excavation/digging activities for kids, the kids became little archeologists. Our kid was very excited about this activity. This museum is pretty interactive. Great history of the Viking age in Ireland and you ll read a lot of interesting stories of the past. Took some friends here and they really enjoyed it! Great museum with some artifacts from Dublins past. See, its early years as a viking camp to its medieval times. Staff was helpful and friendly. One of those must stops for history buffs. I did not booked in advance, but honestly it was empty when I arrived and the guy selling tickets was lovely! Is a mix of museum type, interactive, reading areas, also some simulations of live conditions back then, including a lovely video of a guy that lived during the 15 or 16 century (I might be recollecting the year wrongly) and a guy that gives a live presentation of Viking attires and weapons. Is a really instructive lil museum, you are allowed at the end to visit the top of the tower. Lots of stairs but you can see Dublin within the 4 cardinal points. Museum connects with St. Michael Church, you can either buy tickets for both or just one place. I regretted that didn t visit this museum before, it is straightforward, on your pace and full of lil drops of knowledge. The shop, for me, has nothing that I would die for, I think it could do more regarding the Museum main topic, but others might disagree. Interesting museum for both children and adults. A chronological journey takes you through the Viking and even medieval times. The immersion is very successful thanks to the proximity of the scenes. Audio terminals and screens, offering several languages, allow you to understand life at the time through simple explanations or historical anecdotes. Activities are offered to children which makes the course attractive. It takes 1h30 for the visit but if you are curious, count on 2h30. Leaving the museum, you will have learned the history of Dublin from its creation to the present day; particularly interesting story. Viking & medieval museum to do with children. Some description terminals in FR. Reproduction of Viking weapons, Viking village and also medieval village with reconstruction of a bourgeois residence of the time. Some friendly and patient actors/speakers for the English/French translations for the little ones so that they understand medieval professions. I recommend Really interesting museum about the Viking era in Dublin. Worth a visit - entry is  15 per adult Super interesting history of Dublin. Not sure the cost is equal to the experience but well done none the less Nice place for some Vikings history, but you can also visit the National Museum and get more Vikings history for free. You can tour the entire facility in about 30 to 60 minutes. Extremely interesting display and interactive self guided visit. You can climb to the to of the clock tower . The views are amazing. Remember to ask for the combo ticket if you are going to visit the cathedral as well. Great little Museum to learn about the history of the city. Lots of interesting things to see. The Tour guide was very knowledgeable. Definitely the best place to go and learn about the origins of Dublin and Ireland itself.  Affodable, child friendly and charming tour! Very nice top view at the end. The museum ended past the bridge leading to Chris Church across the street. I learned a lot about Ireland pre potato famine. You can buy combo ticket for both the church and museum for 22.25, instead of 11+15. Dublinia, the Vikings museum, is cool with lots of interesting facts you can explore. The place is a bit small, but you learn a bunch fantastic for children. Climbing the towers 96 steps provides a view that is not particularly spectacular, and theres an extra fee for the telescope, which is kind of a downer after paying  15 to get in. Overall, Dublinia is fun, but it would be better with more space and free telescope use. Consider buying combined tickets for  21 if youre also interested in seeing the Christ Church Cathedral next door. Great museum for those who want to learn the history of Dublin. There are a lot of activities for kids and plenty for adults to stay busy for a few hours while visiting. There is a tower you can walk up to get a 360-degree view of the surrounding area. Everything is well maintained and clean. Very organized where you walk through the years from the start of Dublin to the medieval ages. If you want to learn something new or just something for your kids to do, be sure to check out Dublina. Go to their website for news on current activities going on and coming up True immersion in Viking culture. This museum appeals to young and old alike. Very beautiful view from the top of the tower. Dublinia is a fantastic blend of history and interactive fun. As a Viking and medieval museum, it offers a captivating learning experience. The interactive areas, where you can trace certificates and try on Viking gear or medieval helmets, add an engaging and hands-on element to the visit, making history come to life. If you happen to have the Go City Pass, its definitely worth including Dublinia in your itinerary, especially if you have a passion for history museums. The museum provides an informative and enjoyable journey through Dublins Viking and medieval past. Dont miss the opportunity to visit the tower as well. Climbing 96 stairs may sound like a challenge, but the reward of breathtaking views of Dublin at the top makes it entirely worth the effort. Its a must-see for anyone exploring the city and looking to gain both historical insights and panoramic perspectives. Loved this museum and learning about the Viking heritage of this location!  The walkway and to the cathedral next door was amazing!  The architecture and the stained glass was amazing! The cathedral next door has a crypt, but it wasn t open at that time.  So it means I ll have to be going back to Ireland to experience that! This museum was extremely interesting, accessible for both adults and children! The visit was superb, we were able to fully enjoy our experience and left with lovely souvenirs from the shop! Walk-through history lesson about the history of Dublin, from the earliest Viking arrivals to the present day.  Self-paced walk-through that is well laid-out and interesting with a mix of audio/visual and physical displays. I really enjoyed my visit to Dublinia.  The exhibits on display detailing the Viking origins of Dublin were very interesting.  One of the museum guides, Heather, provided me an interesting description of their medieval Dublin map as well.  I also found that the Black Death and other diseases section was also great. Very interesting, totally kids friendly! The staff were very gentle and friendly. The view from the tower was a little bit disappointed, the modern buildings didn t let appreciate the views. went with a 5 and an 8 y/o and were in for 2.5 hours. loads of interactive activities and an overall very immersive experience! highly recommend. at the end you can climb up a tower and get a good view of Dublin A historic museum in the heart of Dublin with a timeline oriented approach to the city s Viking & Medieval past life, utilising an immersive experience style of exhibition. Informative and interesting, with enough interactive features to keep you fascinated. Great for both kids & adults alike. Great interactive museum about vikings& middle age in Dublin with lots of pictures, text, movies,models of Dublin,  audio in at least 4 languages. There are also dressed up  actors that explain, for example, viking clothes or weapons. Loved the real life size exhibits of houses, markets, or ships. Also the big movie screen with the story of a mercant was nice. We spend at least 2h and could read& see everything. Went on a Saturday afternoon, and it cost 15  per adult. Its a huge exposition about the history of Dublin, from the first Vikings to nowadays. You can easily spend 3+ hours there if you want to see everything with time! Would recommend :) Amazing experience and engaging for kids. Well worth the money. The actors and guides add beautifully to the visit. All staff were very nice and helpful. Would advise getting the ticket with Christ Church tour too, if you have the time. Amazing museum with a lot of information about Vikings stories. It s not a traditional place to visit, but I would definitely recommend to everybody. There s also some interactive experiences and lots of different types of information that makes the visit unforgettable. Such a cool museum of Irelands history with the Vikings. I really enjoyed it as an adult with no kids but Ive heard kids really enjoy it too. We only had an hour or so to explore it which was just enough. If you enjoy history, check it out!  The tower also offers a nice view of the city and way less busy than other tourist traps. We had the best time visiting Dublinia, also due to the new hire Amber, who was enthusiastic and a real gem! We cant wait for her to start giving tours because Im sure shell do great! ~ much love from Jo, Kelly & Amy from The Netherlands - If you, like me, are into Viking history, its a MUST visit! Also buy a combo ticket with the Christ Church Cathedral. I deeply regret spending my money and an hour of my time there. The  museum  is basically an exhibition full massive amounts of text to read. There are some life-sized figures, models and maybe 50 real artifacts which are tiny for the most part. General information about Vikings and shared absolutely nothing I did not already know. Kids loved it, the fact that they could touch a lot of the stuff here compared to other places weve been lately. They loved the fact that they could dress like a viking and throw balls at a mannequin in the stocks. They also liked sitting in the stocks to have their pictures taken. Very nice little museum retracing the history of Dublin in broad terms. Amazing! A very interesting museum, beautiful and tidy.  Suitable for the whole family, experiential activity for children, lots of interesting information.  Spending a few hours.  Do not give up going up to the tower, it is not that difficult and the view is very beautiful. Very fun experience it s an easy way to learn and have fun as well. The decorations, figures, lighting, sounds and everything was perfect, the information laid out in a very nice detailed order it s easy to follow up with the events by reading and looking at the objects and figures. Lots of fun interesting ways to deliver the historical events through out the place, I enjoyed it! Also the gift shop was nice! I recommend it for 12+ years old. Absolutely incredible, helpful, pleasant staff.  The venue is very accessible for wheelchairs.  I was accompanied by my Assistance Dog on a very hot day and the staff asked frequently if he wanted water and they all knew proper Assistance Dog etiquette.  The displays were informative and were presented in a manner that would be interesting for a spectrum of ages and interests.  I liked that there were many multimedia and hands on experiences. Great place to learn about the Vikings history of Ireland! It is a good place to go with kids or to spend at least 2 hours in. There are many interactive activities that will make your time better in there. Definitely a lovely activity for a rainy day :)! Incredible place for a tour full of history and rich in details about the Viking immigration and its role on Ireland colonization. Be prepared to walk a lot since there are 3 floors of information and items being shown. While the place is stroller friendly due to the lifts, some places have minor steps(3 of them) and youll have to  take care while pushing your infant around. My third time visiting Dublinia, this time child-free which meant I could read all the information and exhibitions. A great place to spend a few hours, with or without the kids. You get a sneak peak into both Viking snd Medieval Dublin. Highly recommend visiting Dublinia!"
66,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,4.65,"A very indepth look at Irish people, their immigration, history, and their influence on the world. Lots of facts and interactive exhibits rich with personal stories and history. Well worth a few hours on one of those rainy Dublin days. Highly recommend. We were in Dublin and wanted to learn more about the country and culture. So we decided to go to the epic museum. Although tickets are on the pricier side, we enjoyed the experience. They give you a travel passport that you scan at the end of each exhibit, which makes it exciting. We loved the history and wished we had more time to visit. A great museum that we d for sure recommend to people. An unusual museum in the heart of the city. An excellent experience not to be missed when traveling to this city. We learn a lot about the emigration of the Irish which is little known to us in France. The atmosphere in the museum is great, we really feel captivated by the environment. The price remains very reasonable compared to other museums in the city. In addition, the employees will do their utmost to understand you and make themselves understood even if you speak little or no English. Little extra, the passport is stamped in each room of the museum, an additional souvenir completely free. A detour to this museum is highly recommended. Really fun and interactive museum! One of the best museum I have been to! It s great for locals and tourists and you can learn a lot with the way they design the museum. It s modern and well thought! I am really impressed by it! I highly recommend it !! Very beautiful museum! We had a great time with our children! An audio guide is available free of charge on the phone Allow 2 hours of visit Small restaurant nearby They say it takes 90 minutes to go through, but you could spend 5-6 hours easily if you want to see the self guided tour in its entirety. Ok museum, very technologically advanced displays.  $25, for adults, $21 for Seniors. Ticket good for 10 days so dont rush for the entire viewing. In one day. Since exhibits are a waste of time and push a liberal agenda, so if that offends you, stay away. They boast a 7am to 7pm but we got their at 7 am and had to wait until 10 when they really open. If you know nothing about your past or heritage, this is a great exhibition. For those who have had an interest all their life in their past, this will be too commercial for your liking. Great for a wet day, but challenge yourself to explore Dublin more. Also dont get caught out in the gift shop, everything will be cheaper and available across town! There are multiple coffee and food shops beyond the exit that is also accessible from tbe street Fascinating and unique. Take the time to see this. Highly interactive and engaging. You will get your digital fix here with no need for your phone. A must see. Very pleasant and very interesting museum with interactive spaces, as well as a passport given at the start of the visit which traces the museum which can be stamped at each room visited (The interactive spaces are interesting but not really accessible if you don t speak English) Quite a long visit, we must have stayed around 2 hours The audio guides cost 2  but you can have them on your phone using a QR code at the entrance to the museum for free (the information is quite general but still teaches us things) In the building there are many shops and restaurants which is pleasant The only small downside that we can find is the price of entry but you can return at any time you want within 10 days Great morning spent at the EPIC museum.  50 for 2 adults and 1 child including 4 hrs parking. Plenty to explore and read including videos to watch, interactive screens and games. They give you a passport to be stamped in each room. My toddler got plenty of amusement from this! We can return FREE within 10 days using the same tickets, well worth a visit to learn about the Irish how far they stretch across the globe, the reasons why they emigrated and some of the success stories that followed, and some of the not so great either. Excellent museum curation! No wonder its been closen as one of the best museums in Ireland.  ts a must to see if you want to learn more about Ireland and Irish culture or you must bring your tourist friends coming from abroad. Whenever I visit it brings new questions and opinions about immigration, belonging and adaptation concepts. The museum store is also very large and lovely with a lot of original souvenirs. A great and immersive experience! I really learned alot about emigration through the years, and about achievements of Irish descendants. The exhibitions are also beautifully curated and the whole experience is well thought out. However, it feels like the museum is made for foreigners with Irish descent, such as Irish-Americans. A way to be proud and learn about their Irish culture and heritage. So in summary; great experience, but maybe not the best museum if you want to learn about Irish history and culture. A fun, interactive museum with a lot of Irish history. Our guide was humorous and incredibly knowledgeable. If you have time, I would recommend visiting. One of the best museums Ive ever been to. I spent an hour here, and learned a lot about Irish history. Very interesting and highly recommended. The EPIC Museum is a must-see for any tourist in Dublin. It is a great way to learn about Irish history and culture. It is also worth checking temporary exhibitions. The one about Irish people in the Caribbean is very interesting My son & I decided to use one morning back in May to discover the EPIC Museum. I was intrigued to see that most of the museum was essentially underground - a sort of under the arches experience. We walked the well marked route, taking time at each exhibit and each room to stamp our museum passports. There is a lot to see, read and snippets of videos to watch. I think that its safe to say that, by the end we had a pretty good idea of all the key elements of Irish history since the ravages of the fungus Phytophthora infestans, the potato blight disease that ravaged the potato crop back in the 1840s By the way, being a plant pathologist at the beginning of my career, I always remember that this disease was the reason for there now being so many cops of Irish descendancy in the New York Police Department today! By the end of our self made tour we began to tire a little of all the information provided. But, overall this was a nice experience and great way to spend a morning in this vibrant city. I don t like museums BUT this one was so well made and an adventure to explore around. My interest and amazement was constant throughout the museum. It was beautiful to show that despite the suffering and hard times, the Irish raised themselves up and created a name for themselves through music, sports, and overall life. It is a very deep memorial that I as a child of an immigrant connect so deeply with. There s a stamp activity you can do that makes you so excited for the next exhibit! Congratulations for this incredible work. I loved this museum. I was able to understand the history of Ireland as a whole with this museum full of history and emotion. I cried, laughed  very stylish and very fun with incredibly kind and professional staff. Special mention for the exhibition on the Caribbean. This exhibition shocked me. Thank you for recognizing our Caribbean history This was a good museum for information on Emigration our of Ireland.  It covers many many eras of people leaving due to famine, oppression, war etc. You can also get a tour of a remake of the Jeanie Johnston famine ship. It really shows how desperate people were to flee Ireland during the famine, with 200 people sharing the space of a medium sized American bed room. The Jeanie Johnston was different from other famine ships who stuffed 300 people into the same space and the death rate was much higher. First time visit and so impressed with it. I have recommended to everyone. Very interesting exhibition and also quite interactive. Upon our visit we got a free entry for 2 for another visit so I gave these to my Dad. This is my second visit to the EPIC so, convince for me because I stayed at Hilton garden. This is a must see museum in Dublin. Visited on This is a must visit if you travel to Dublin. Each room is filled with interesting, interactive exhibits. It being awarded Europes leading tourist attraction multiple years in a row is well deserved. During our recent visit to Dublin, my boyfriend Pete and I stumbled upon the EPIC Immigration Museum, and we were pleasantly surprised by what we discovered. We would rate our experience 4 stars! Our entry was made even more appealing thanks to our Go City Card, which included admission. Upon entering, we were given a passport, a unique touch that added an element of fun and engagement to our visit. We eagerly stamped our passports in each room, which turned out to be a delightful surprise. The museum truly lives up to its name - its EPIC in its scope and offerings. We were amazed by the variety of exhibits and interactive displays that covered a wide range of topics. From Irish literature and sports to criminals, movies, and theatre, there seemed to be a room for every interest. The themed rooms were not only diverse but also incredibly interesting. We found ourselves immersed in the rich history and culture of Ireland, learning about the contributions of immigrants in various fields. The interactive elements added a layer of engagement that made the experience both educational and enjoyable. While we thoroughly enjoyed our visit, were rating it 4 stars as we believe theres room for improvement in terms of providing even more detailed information in some areas. However, the EPIC Immigration Museum is undeniably a must-visit for those interested in Irish history and culture, and we left with a greater appreciation for the impact of immigration on this beautiful country. Fantastic museum with stories, interactive exhibitions and themed rooms. Very beautifully curated with personal stories. You can also return within a 10 day period for free. I would recommend this museum to anyone who has an interest in Irish history and it s people. Visited on I have a keen interest in history and enjoyed my visit. The tour guide was very good. I do think however the museum is overrated and would leave it short two stars for the following reasons- 1. There is not much to interest younger kids. I would only bring the kids if they are teens and have some interest in history. 2. This is an experience museum, with interactive displays. There are no artefacts which is what I love to look at most going to museums. While there are some stunning visual displays its all a bit samey. They do a passport that allows you to revisit within a set time period. So all on balance a nice visit but if I was advising a tourist only doing one I would definitely do the national history museum at Collins Barracks or the Natural History museum instead. Call museum is a great job of honoring Irish culture in history Theres a lot of Irish in the world!  Its a good thing! A lot of reading, lights and displays.  I was hoping to see more physical objects from the past.  Your ticket is good for 10 days!  Go back and soak it all in Just fantastic. It covers every chief aspect of a culture and was a superb introduction to what Irish really means for my daughters who were visiting Ireland with us for the first time. Worth the visit. You can return anytime within 10 days after purchasing the entrance. Makes sense to go another time, as there is so much to discover. Among the most interesting museums in Dublin. The visit requires a minimum of 1h30 audio guide not bad but it must be supplemented with the information given in each room I saw some pictures online from the museum that intrigued me - so I decided to add this place to visit during my Dublin trip. And I was not disappointed whatsoever. This is a very visual and interactive experience, the museum is divided into sections of Irish emigration experiences, with lots of information provided in every room. Its a very modern museum, with nostalgic feeling, when youre reading up the letters people sent during their emigration journeys. It really left me inspired and a bit teared up! Definitely worth a visit! Inspiring experience, i would recommend you plan 2 hours for the visit, I learned things about the Irish history, Highly recommended! The ticket was for  22, but you can use it multiple times during the year. The EPIC Irish Emigration Museum is an eye-opening experience in Dublin, offering a deep dive into the Irish emigration story. Its interactive and engaging, filled with personal stories and historical insights. I highly recommend visiting the Jeannie Johnston ship tour beforehand, as it sets the perfect historical context and enriches the museum experience. A truly educational and memorable visit! We reserved a meeting with the geneologist to learn about our ancestors. Doing research ahead of time will definitely help. The expert (I forgot her name) went through it to check and verify.   Then went well beyond to give tips and tricks for me to follow up with - including trade grant sites and lease and census reports. This was a neat and unique highlight of our trip.  At home in Canada, we say on St Patricks Day, everyone has a little Irish in them.   This place proves it! Love how they have the FREE option to have an auditory tour (bringing your own head/earphones and downloading the app) Usually up to PS3-5/ 3-9 euro depending on the place. So with it being free made us take in each exhibition more and end up being more immersed with the museum. Loved the interior layout and the vast amount of time they put on each section. The passport system is fun as it makes you actually stay in each room (even to just find where it is located) Well put museum and definitely enjoyed learning more about the history surrounding emigration. Excellent experience.  Interactive museum exhibitions with all modern technology,  steeped in Irish history and culture. It also represents the island of Ireland. For all people North and South. Accessible by the CHQ building.  Gift shop has some nice items not found in other shops.  Photography is no only allowed its encouraged.  The exhibition passports are a lovely touch. Good interactive experience. I didn t mind paying the admission fee at all. Although if there is one comment, if there was more artifacts or historic photos to help support the interactive stories then it would even be better. Visited on Weekend Ive done my fair share of museums, but this one was really impressive. The amount of interaction offered is impressive. All sorts of games, displays and informative signs. There is a free audio guide that you can download and you get a passport that you can stamp in every room that doubles as a map of the museum. A great museum for kids as well! Definitely worth the entrance price, so dont hesitate and put this on your to-do list. One last hint: pre-booking online saves 2 euros Explore the long history of Irish emigration story. There were suppression, depression, famine, colonial cause. But more than those are how the cultural influence across music, literature, food, music, dance, sport and politics. Its interesting to see how Irish review their own story and the museum arranged that with many individuals narration. Must see!  Highly recommend visiting this museum.  Take your time, dont rush through.  Note your ticket is good to return if needed.  We did this over two visits."
67,Easter Egg Tree,4.75,"Cute!! Best tree I ve seen in a long time. 10/10 would recommend, now even blossoming A lovely tree on a lovely street! Beautiful in bloom. It s a tree full of eggs. What more could you want. nan"
68,Ella's Heaven Cafe & Bakery,4.775,"We were lucky this time to get a table, as we ve tried few times before and it was always packed. First thing that impressed me was nice dishes set (plates, tea cups and etc), except water was served in plastic cups.  We were waiting long enough but it was worth it, as very fresh and hot adjaruli khachapuri and khinkali was just delicious (its not called heaven for nothing). We didn t like pkhali as we never tried it before we don t have nothing to compare. To be honest, Georgian hospitality was not enough for us. But we definitely will come back to try the other dishes. WOW! Went to Ellas Heaven for the first time recently on my inaugural trip to Ireland. The doughnut was very good value for its size, and the pasty was brilliant. When I return to Ireland, Ill certainly be coming back. The staff were also very friendly. Terrible service, the staff is rude and sarcastic, when asked about the availability of sauces for khinkali, we were rudely told if you want it, go buy it!!! When asked to help open the toilet (it was a little unclear), 1 man began to exclamate outrageously (clucking and hooting)! We wont come a second time. There are no complaints about the cook, the khachapuri and khinkali are divine, you will lick your fingers. It s a pity that the waiters were in a terrible mood! We were in the establishment on 04/29/24 at about 15:00 then three of us at the table had difficulty seeing and never once noticed a smile on the waiter s face; we did not demand sauces, but asked if they were available. to which we can answer that they are not there, and not send us to buy them, violating your rules (I don t care about them since I didn t break them!) there were 2-3 people and 3-4 workers in the room past us whom we saw , you said the password several times, but it did not unlock the toilet door and we politely asked for help to open it, to which your waiter, who at that moment was sitting and eating khinkali, began to be loudly indignant, we are not deaf if anything. terrible impression only about 1 person, an unpleasant waiter, we liked the dishes, I m not your guest, I m a buyer and I pay for dishes and service that you don t have!!!! The most authentic Turkish dessert in town with great coffee, cozy place and nice atmosphere. They also have delicious Georgian dishes, everything is just so delicious. Definitely recommended! I recently stumbled across Ella s Heaven when looking for somewhere to have lunch near Connolly station. I m glad I did! The cafe has a great mix of Georgian and Turkish food and coffee for a reasonable price. I would hugely recommend the spinach, cheese and egg pide. Looking forward to going back to try the baklava and dumplings. Excellent Khachapuri and the Baklava was honestly the best Ive tasted in Ireland, all very authentically traditional, even the surly service! Really enjoyed all the dishes and drinks on offer. (Tip for the owners; there are two lights flickering in the seating area, those can drive certain people nuts, please change the bulbs!) The small but cute cafe its must go to. My friend recommended it to me and I am definitely going to go back a few times for sure. Once you walk in you are created by a wonderful staff and art pieces on the wall. The food is freshly made and very delicious and filling. The coffee and hot chocolate was 10/10. The place was spotlessly clean and tidy. This is the definition of a hidden gem.  Had a great coffee (in a very fancy cup) and some really really good baklava. I am planning to go back just to get more baklava. I been here yesterday It was fantastic food.. Amazing The word is not enough.. Actually if you want to try nice food you have to visit here.. we tried fried khinkali, khachapuri Even sweets were absolutely delicious Best Baklavas I have ever tried in Ireland This cozy small bakery has left the best impressions! Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation..The service we received was so amazing and we will definitely be back again. They made us feel welcomed and gave us an amazing experience. Vegetarian options: Pastries,sweets and etc. The best Turkish desserts in Dublin are here. Fresh and daily production. A little more expensive than other restaurants. But it is worth the price you give.  The portions are large and the materials used are of good quality. Especially you should try F st kl  Kaday f   Baklava  and  Yay k Ayran . Its a little small place but I didnt wait in line before. People who love sweets need to visit this place. Amazing fresh pastries and Turkish  coffee! The Knafeh and Baklava were both very crisp and fragrant! Been here a couple of times to get some Georgian food. Their khinkali is good however it can take a while to get cook, I was waiting 20-30 mins during my lunch break. Their food is quite compact. They mostly seem to concentrate on coffee and desserts. Id go back again to try more of their food but might need more time. Was interested as i have never eaten Georgian food before. Tried a small pide (in Turkey this is a borek) and tried the tarragon lemonade. Very impressed by both and the service was excellent from a very polite gentleman. Strong recomendation, very moderm decor,  spotlessly clean, and the people cared that i had a good experience. Honestly, this place should have Michelin stars.  The food here is outstanding. I treat myself once a week. No idea what anything is called but so far everything has been delicious, like nothing else I have ever tasted. I am particularly fond of something that is like a very light savoury doughnut, crispy on the outside and filled with potato. Sublime. (The owner is kind of chilly. Concentrate on the food.) Vegetarian options: Suitable for vegetarians and vegans Dietary restrictions: They are helpful about allergies. Visited this coffee shop on Saturday afternoon. Place realy busy,but theres a reason,because of very nice and tasty food. We had turksih coffee,flat white, adjapuri with spinat and adjapuri with beef mince and portion of dumplings aswell. For a first time to taste food was amazing,fresh and well made. Coffee unreal! Want to say big THANK YOU for all staff! Best of luck! Edited on 08/09/2023. Back here after 7 months,food still proper,has brilliant taste,think coffee one of the best ones in Dublin Absolutely one of my favorite meals in the city! Everything was delicious and the staff was so kind. Would visit again! Nice bakery and they have authentic delicious   georgian food  . I wanted to try some amazing georgian food and I found only this bakery to be serving so many varieties of georgian food  . They have georgian dumplings also and many delicacies. This is a must visit cafe if one wants to try some eastern european food  . Ambience is nice and it is very close to Lidl. Their Adjaruli Khachapuri is must try. They have both options in vegetarian and non vegetarian. Also one can try their Imeruli kachapuri and Megruli kachapuri. They have one of the finest baklava   try some baklava with coffee Really great place for authentic Georgian food. We had a khachapuri and some veg sides. The aubergine side was delicious and original for a european taste. The veg patties were nice, but didn t beat the aubergine. The khachapuri was very filling and comforting. The ambiance is great and feels like taking a holiday to Georgia with a reception run by Turkey :) A very nice and clean spot to have a good pastry and a nice coffee in the busy city centre area. My preferred place with Georgian food and where I charge my battery with a good coffee. Keep it like that guys Or ...you can get a nice coffee and pastry and get it on the Liffey and enjoying while weather its nice. Had a lovely meal at the restaurant this evening. The cheese spinach dish (I apologize for forgetting the name!) and the Turkish sweet were both wonderful and filling. 100% value for money whilst also feeling like eating at a premium place, which is great for someone on a student budget. The staff were absolutely wonderful - didnt get the name of the Azerbaijani man at the front desk but he was absolutely top! Will definitely come visit again! The place is beautiful, and the prices are very reasonable. Turksih coffee and baklawa are amazing  . Meat is halal. Food : 5/5 Absolutely lovely food, my favorite place for khachapuri and Khinkali . They guys working there could be a little nicer, sometimes you talk with them and they don t even answer. Cosy place in Talbot street. Nice atmosphere, Huge selection of pastries. The coffee very tasty. I tried the Napoleon, was delicious , my friend ordered a pistachio baklava also delicious . Overall I recommend everyone. The place is amazing. I asked the person taking orders I didnt really like coffee very much but needed one to stay awake. He took it on himself to prepare an amazing coffee as he would prepare it for himself, showing great customer skills. The coffee was delicious and I had a cheese bread that tasted like heaven. Will definitely be coming back. Thank you for your hard work and for making me the best coffee I have ever had. It is the best place ever, the service is absolutely amazing and so are the people. Our family has got food there for the past years and all the food tastes absolutely incredible. I highly recommend it!! Thank you so much to all the staff!! Really fabulous, Americano, Turkish coffee and their baked goods are wonderful. The window display what all cafes should aspire to. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great place to visit. Food A truly unique experience! One of the only places in Dublin where you can try authentic Georgian cuisine. I had the cheese Khachapuri along with a Turkish coffee. The khachapuri was comforting and extremely filling. The small portion is more than enough for most people & it is generously priced for what you get. If youre a fan of cheese, then this is definitely for you, one of the nicest cheese dishes Ive had! The Turkish coffee was also flavoursome and packs a punch, definitely wakes you up! I definitely recommend Ellas Heaven if youre looking for something unique in the heart of Dublin. A warm and welcoming escape just steps from busy OConnell Street, this cosy cafe serves up authentic Turkish and Georgian treats with a smile. The menu features an array of freshly baked goods, hot drinks prepared with care , and homemade Georgian dishes showcasing the regions unique flavors. The interior is simply decorated with colorful fabrics, potted plants and wood details that combine with the aroma of spices and freshly brewed tea to transport you to the Caucasus region. Staff are attentive and eager to make recommendations from the extensive menu, which features specialties like Adjaruli, simit and lahmajun flatbread. Whether youre looking for an caffeine and pastry fix, a leisurely brunch, or to sample a taste of the Caucasus, this cafe - with its traditional decor, attentive staff, and authentic Turkish and Georgian cuisine - delivers an experience that will leave you wanting to return again and again. Highly recommended! This place is stunning. Its a small cosy restaurant Cafe, with comfortable light ambiance, that makes several Georgian dishes and Turkish desserts. I have only tried the Khachapuri Adjaruli, which is a crusty bread filled with cheese, a semi fried egg on top, along with butter. (see photo) You have to mix them together before munching. Let me tell you that it was so good and delicious. Be sure to come hungry, so that you can actually finish your meal, since I ordered the small size and still felt satisfying full. In terms of service/ hospitality, it is up to your perspective to what that can be, as I found it quite good. Since the staff can be, and is actually busy at times, and so they might not give you a smile or anything at first, but eventually they will. At least the food can make up for that. It might be beneficial to learn a few Georgian/ Azeri phrases and maybe learn a bit about their cultures, to feel immersed and appreciative, but you really dont have to, just come and try the food. I am delighted to have tried the Khachapuri at this cosy Cafe restaurant, and would definitely recommend. 5/5. Vegetarian options: They have a vegetarian option, the Khachapuri Adjaruli. Its a lovely place with an amazing kitchen. Be prepared to wait for your meal a bit, though. The toilet is clean. Tables are a bit too close to each other, but I think its inevitable because of the place size. Food Great find on Talbot Street. Food, decor and staff all fantastic. I was given fresh Megruli pastry out of the oven and a lovely strong coffee to go with it. Will be back to try the Georgian dumplings! Honestly the food was delicious, looked homemade and the price was good. Thats why I give it 4 stars. The staff wasnt the friendliest though, and maybe I could have used a better presentation on the food. But overall a good place if you want to eat good food. Always when I am in city center I buy Turkish sweets! They are amazing! So many options and every time I would love to buy them all :) my favourite one   with a pistachio. Classic chilled cafe! Great selection of sweet and savoury dishes at a very reasonable price. The staff are very friendly and easy going. The place is spotless. Amazing food! Really glad that you opened, I have been craving Georgian food for the longest time! I also took Turkish coffee and baklava that were super tasty. Will come back soon!! Good food. Very few tables. No tables available every time we come and people queuing for a table. We took some pies for take away. went here for by chance for a donut I seen in the window ,nd boy was I cold , the guy serving me noticed my shivering and offered me a warm drink with the donut. He was so friendly and polite and now anytime Im in Dublin Ill be 100% dropping in for another of those whopping Donuts. BTW the donuts are absolutely divine . Thank you to the gentleman who severed me. You really made my day Excellent food no doubt! But pricey and poor service. They can be favorite place with a little bit effort the dishes are quite tasty especially the egg pita but in my opinion the desserts are even better. You should definitely come here and try the egg pita and baklava. Best Turkish Cafe and Bakery in City Centre. Open a big full fledged cafe . The place is tiny to enjoy. They rely on Takeaways Food : 5/5 |"
69,Esquires - The Organic Coffee Co (ILAC),4.475,"Food: pancakes are amazing price per portion  worth it would just add that would be better were added fruits between layers of pancakes, sensibility they could replace the smoothy cups to reused as for seating and not take away situation , Service: Fast and efficient service both on till and for table. Atmosphere : for a packed sunny Sunday was very nice and chilled not too crowded nor noisy. This is my go-to shop for coffee. Amazing coffee. They have some good options for having a light snack. Lovely hot chocolate... friendly staff, nice place to cool down from the shopping hectic This is one of my best coffee experience. Their coffee is amazing. I had one of my best coffee at this shop. Moreover they have many food varieties. Also their food is very great and reasonably priced. In just 7.95 euro one can get extremely delicious pancakes. Their waffels are also good. Croissant are priced at only 2.95 euro and are extremely tasty. Cinnamon bun is a must try and pastel de nata at 2.5 euro is a good deal. Also their ambience is superb and there is plenty of space. Chairs are very comfortable and staff is extremely polite and helpful. Their 4 layer chocolate cake and vegan strawberry cheesecake both at 4.15 euro is a must try. There are many vegan options available at this cafe and it is a great place for vegan food. They also have coconut water, coke, fanta, vitamin water. Also they have summer special food items. Their vegan nourish bowl is nice. Overall it is a must visit coffee shop if one is at llac center at Henry street. The most flavorful organic coffee I ve ever tasted. The staff is always nice and serves fast!! It has an acquired taste of coffee and can be strong. Small selection of pastries and sandwiches also are there for takeaway. We had the mexicana fries and belgian waffle. Both taste delicious and their coffee taste great as well. Located beside the Savoy cinema, this coffee place serves the most delicious coffee in the City Centre. It is open from 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. They have quite an extensive menu for a cafe, serving breakfast, bagels, paninis, wraps, sandwiches, salads and even lasagne. Apart from coffee, you can also get smoothies, milkshakes, hot chocolate, chai and fresh juices. The staff is very helpful and polite. The prices are affordable. The only negative point is the rather limited place to sit inside. Staff are consistently great. They are v professional. Got a vegan sausage roll with a decaf tea. Choice of plant milk was oat, soya  coconut and almond. #vegan Great coffee and very friendly staff. It s inside the mall on the first floor. Fyi Google maps has accurate info on this place but Apple Maps says it s permanently closed.  I can verify it s open and lively :) What a delightful little cafe. Clean and welcoming. The staff are excellent, very polite and make awesome coffee (see the macchiato pictured) Loved the cinnamon bun and my cappuccino was delicious and stayed hot They open quite early and got the chance to drink hot choc while waiting for bus trip in the cold morning. Best coffee, definitely have to order their mocha. Staff are great and very good mood all the time! Going there almost once a day I got a coffee on the way and it was delicious. First time i tried it and i really liked it. I am absolutely coming back to try some of pastries and food options. Staffs were so friendly too, also clean and neat place! Nice ambience with good spread of coffee, tea, smoothies and hot chocolate, as well as some pastries! There are two levels to sit and it is pretty conducive for a chat or relaxation :) Very good hot chocolates. Although very limited on space, the seating arrangement in mezzanine floor and ground floor is good. Prices are reasonable. Small place but with good staff and plenty of good things. As a Dublin visitor and not local I really recommend. Really cosy spot at the top of Dublins OConnell Street. Fair trade drinks and tasty snacks. Awful service. Unable to order anything.  Ignored while standing at the till. Staff lady also gave the soft drink I had gotten from the fridge to another customer. Very inappropriate pair of staff members in today 8/10/23 2pm. Very nice spot and cakes however, lack of customer services today a blond guy who is making the coffee gave me a large coffee when I ordered a regular one. I told him I did not want it so, he respond was you have to pay a new one even I did not touch. For a bussiness like you making another coffee to a customer who bought a cake its not a lose. You have lose a customer for his rude and not supporting at all service. The staff should confirm with customer the orders. 12/08/22 16.49pm Fabulous spot, great coffee, lovely atmosphere, worth travelling to Actually this was for the other premises just up the road, didnt try this one If I could give this cafe more stars I would! There are amazing staff who work here in this tiny establishment but they make an effort to remember the locals who pop in for their daily coffees and ensure to make them feel special - they have even been giving out Christmas cards with free coffee vouchers in them to the regulars they see everyday. This is the best example of customer service i have ever experienced, and they manage it so flawlessly even though they are situated right in the  middle of the busiest street in Dublin where they must serve a thousand people a day. The coffee is also beautiful, smooth and there are so many non-dairy and flavour options. The service is also incredibly fast and efficient which is perfect for a daily commuter like me. Love this place. Nice staff; had a lovely cake &cappuccino Fantastic flat white delivered to your table with a friendly smile. Great coffee shop in the heart of Dublin. Good customer service, nice clean shop and most importantly... the coffee was good! They put their passion into the business, and you could see that from the presentation on their coffees. I was defiantly a pleasant visit! One of the only coffee shops that opens at 6.30am. Great coffee, pastries and service. The staff are lovely and deal with the long early morning queues (tour buses leave at 7) with grace and professionalism. Nice seating area upstairs. Lovely place , staff are friendly and the tea was delicious . I recommend this place. Ask for Coffee and Gourmet sausage roll said setting in .Coffee came in paper cup  Sausage roll came in a Box. You have cooked some plates and no offer of one. Bad service all round. My favourite coffee shop. Great coffee and nice staff. I usually get a take away coffee I. The morning, I cant rate the food and cakes. (the cakes looks so nice but Im always in healthy mode in the morning) Wonderful little coffee shop on one of Dublins busiest thoroughfares. Inside is a little oasis of calm. The staff are very helpful and nice which is so good. What I liked was that I ordered an Earl Grey and it was real leaves, in a pot! Wonderful. Just a nice view while enjoying your coffee at the terrace, but nothing special. I asked the seller what coffee blend do they use but couldnt answer, she not even know where the coffees coming from.  However, thats a clean place with polite employees. Friendly people, good coffee, great croissant. Great coffee. Have a nice outdoor seating area too.. 4 stars because I just read out their walls that has loads of information bout their coffee was made. It says it is organic and it is! I believe so the fact that I tasted one of their coffee is worth to try at all. I love mocha for years and this mocha Ive tasted is different and even more tastier than before which intrigues me to come again. Absolute gem of a place. Not only for the fabulous coffee but the staff really make the place.A lovely girl called Kennedy there always ready with a smile and warm welcome and the other lovely staff that work there make it a genuinely lovely place to go for coffee ans treat.Woukd highly recommend I love this coffee shop..there are two Esquire Coffee shop on O Connell Street and coffee is nice and same in both but the other one is larger and a lot more seating outside. Staff friendly in both...I see some saying about having to get your own sugar...but thats the way it is in any large coffee chain. Sugar, chocolate, cinnamon etc n napkins are just beside where your coffee is left to be collected!! I dont take sugar as Im a vanilla syrup addict!   there are some coffee shops that are nearly 1.50e more expensive...thats with almond n vanilla but the likes of large chains could cost 4.65 whereas smaller shops 3.50. Only thing about Esquire tho friendly staff and good coffee, is no fresh food. All pre packed which personally I dont like. All in all I go regularly and enjoy my time there. Very nice coffee on OConnell Street. If you like lounge and dark atmosphere it is perfect! They have a mezzanine where you can sit on confortable chairs. Coffee served at table. Coffees are excellente and for the price the quantity is great! Ordinary coffee shop that after paying 3.30 euro you they tell you get your own sugar. It was a sit in, after lunch yesterday. One of their waitresses almost threw my already paid capuchino on my table and left Try the oreo shake with ___coffee___!! It tastes like mothers milk if your mom happens to be a goddess     Didnt take a photo because it looked bleak, but looks arent always important ^^ The young barista was very cute. Absolutely ridiculous how terribly fun and friendly each member of staff is here. Its so disgustingly relaxed that I always have to stop in on my way to work for the usual cup of caffeine and am always welcomed with a smile and a friendly verbal greeting."
70,Esquires - The Organic Coffee Co (O'Connell St),4.6,"Our big bus tour stopped in front of here allowing us 15 min to grab coffee. Everyone off the bus went to Nero but we came here to avoid the line. It s a cold and rainy day so I ordered a mint hot chocolate and my friend got a passion storm smoothie. My hot chocolate was very tasty. It was rich and very minty. My friend described her smoothie to taste like a creamsicle. The drinks came out very quick and we used tap to pay for payment. It s a small space but very efficient. I stopped by with my seven-year-old after seeing a movie next-door. I was told at the movie theater, if I show my ticket, I would get 10% off, so I figured why not grab a coffee on my way to do some shopping. I walk in and tell my daughter to sit down at a table towards the entrance of the coffee shop and wait for me. I go to the counter, and I place my order for a coffee and a bakery item and I let the cashier (Asian lady with black short hair) know that my order is complete. She then goes,  and what about the water?. Im a bit confused at first, because I did not order water, but she points her head towards my daughter, who is holding a water bottle. When she mentioned the water bottle, she mentioned it in a tone as she was accusing me of grabbing the water as I walked in and trying to not pay for it. It made me feel really uncomfortable and I did not like it. I let her know once again, we literally just left the movie theater and thats where she got the water from. She says nothing, and then processes my order and I pay for it. You all have CCTV in the shop. If you really felt like we grabbed that water without paying for it, you all couldve checked the cameras. I am not risking any legal trouble for 2.30 euros. I make more in a day than she probably makes in a week. Stop being judgmental. This felt very discriminatory and I dont appreciate it at all. I definitely wont be back. I will visit other locations. This cashier and question needs better training on Customer Service. Great coffee and cinnamon roll! Service and atmosphere are ok, nothing amazing, but good for a quick coffee and work session Tried the mocha it was mediocre tbh, also got the tiramisu. It was disgusting, really stale and just not appetising. Wouldnt recommend this place I took a cappuccino w oat milk, it was so good :) Great coffee cafe spot, I love the vibes and friendly staff! They have a great little upstairs area. Friendly and helpful staff. Many options for sandwiches/wraps/paninis. Coffee was good. Indoor/outdoor seating Vegetarian options: Vegan and vegetarian sandwich options Very tasty coffee, fresh croissants and top notch service. The staff is really nice although they dont offer many vegan options. But it is a nice place to have meetings. Wonderdul coffee and super friendly staff. I really wish k heyd get some lemon and white chocolate muffins in, tho. they never do have them...otherwise its stretch.. Not good.  Even though it s organic coffee, it doesn t make for good espresso and the cheap milk is really bad. It s a lovely place with amazing staff.. Highly recommended their smoothies :) Nice cafe. Friendly staff. Really worth a visit. Nice coffee and enjoyed the fresh pastries Nice coffee and service not expensive It s very good place, with perfect service, and taste food, I recommend this Amazing service and best hot chocolate!! My favorite place to take coffee  . Food Cozy, to meet with friends. So nice!!! Organic coffee Caffetteria posta proprio lungo OConnell St a pochi passi dal GPO Museum. Ambiente molto piccolo ma piacevole, servizio cortese e rapido, come si conviene a un locale del genere. Perfetto per una colazione o per una sosta calda e golosa a meta giornata! Molto consigliato! Nain hyvaa kahvia en ole juonut muualla . Sehr freundliches Team, leckerer Kuchen und sehr guter Kaffee. Viele vegane Angebote. Sehr leckeren Cappuccino hier getrunken Food nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan"
71,Experience Gaelic Games,4.95,"This tour was so fun and a great way to understand the history of these traditional Irish sports.  The experience has super friendly and patient trainers.  The trainers teach you the rules and skills step by step, which then allows you to play a short game.  The tour can be as intense or as relaxed as you want.  It was a very memorable experience and I would highly recommend doing this tour for an Irish experience. The experience is about 3 hours long and you learn three sports:  the first is handball (not the same as Olympic handball - more like squash or racquetball).  Then, they teach you the rules of hurling, which is like field hockey mixed with lacrosse mixed with baseball mixed with cricket.   The last sport they teach you is gaelic football.  That is like basketball mixed with soccer mixed with volleyball and also like American football or rugby.  They take breaks between each sport to explain the rules and give you glasses of water.  The facilities are very nice as well. It is super interesting to learn the history of these sports, how they came to be, and how the Gaelic Athletic Association is an amateur sporting association -- in fact, it is the largest amateur sports association in the world.  Each neighborhood in Ireland has its own club, and the residents play only for their area clubs.  The association does not have any professional players - just amateur players.  They explained how previously the British would ban or restrict their ability to play these traditional sports.  Recently there has been a resurgence in these traditional sports, which is great to see right now.  The trainers also answer all of the questions you may have about any of the sports, how to play the sports, or even about life in Ireland. In conclusion, this experience playing Irish sports is the best and most fun way to experience your time in Ireland, especially if you are traveling with children who like to do active things while on vacation in a foreign country.  As a parent, this experience is a great alternative to indoor activities such as video games, youtube, chess, or other games you may play indoors.  I can not recommend this experience enough.  My children are still talking about the three sports even though it is over.  They will remember this experience forever and playing Gaelic sports will be a highlight of the vacation for them. Amazing day here at experience Gaelic Games. Very friendly and patient staff. Good instructions. Fun and long session of the sports. Would highly recommend coming here. Also afterwards you can walk to the popular pub near the graveyard ;-) So much fun activities! And good to know a interesting sports. The staff is so friendly. An equipments and stadium are all good! We had an excellent time learning about the traditional Irish games of Gaelic football, Hurling, and Gaelic handball. The staff was friendly, welcoming and passionate. A great place for a group activity! Visited on We had a BLAST and learned so much too! Stephen was a great instructor and added in a lot of interesting facts about the history and culture of the games. Would recommend this to any group of any age!! 10/10 and a highlight of our Ireland road trip! Gaelic games were SO fun!! We had such a big group and they accommodated us so well. I had the best experience learning about these traditional Irish games!! Highly recommend!! Cormac and his team are amazing. Not only do they do an excellent job teaching the basics of Gaelic games in a way that allow people to understand and then participate in each sport, they help participants understand the cultural significance of Gaelic games to the people of Ireland. Amazing experience! Really good fun. Well organized and perfect for our stag group. Not all sporty but everyone got involved and worked really well. Sweated out the night before and worked up a thirst for the rest of the day. It is a full on work out. Lots of running. They provide water and have good changing facilities. Had a magical time learning about the history of Gaelic games, the cultural importance and the community spirit around it. It was heaps of fun trying the games for ourselves too. Coaches organised the sessions very well and I will definitely come back with a big group for another round! Lots of fun, so long as you approach it with the attitude that its going to be a goof Experienced Gaelic Games with my classmates in Belfast, and we had the best time. Such a interesting thing to learn about, and then super fun way to get involved. Our coaches were so funny and so kind, and made us all have a great time. Want to come back with all my friends and family! We did this as a work team building activity (most of us were visiting from outside of Ireland) and it was a lot of fun. Be warned though, they will have you running drills and participating regardless of what physical shape youre in (if you have signed the waiver)!! The staff there are friendly and make it a lot of fun. We had such a fun time! We had never heard of the sports of Gaelic football & Hurling.  It was so cool to learn and play these awesome sports. Our kids of 9 & 11 enjoyed it immensely.  Fun for all ages! A fun, and engaging, experience showcasing the rich history of Gaelic Games in Ireland. Absolutely loved it here, organised a stag do for 12 of us to try out Gaelic Football, Hurling and Gaelic Handball, and it was such good fun. Perfect balance of learning the history, culture and passion of the games as well as trying it all out and sweating off the previous nights Guinness! Thanks so much! what a fantastic experience! i loved learning more about irish culture, especially in regards to the gaelic games. the company did a great job of introducing the sports and the importance they hold, as well as how clubs work within northern ireland. the games themselves were so much fun. we had a group of about 60 people, and had the time of our lives! friendships were broken and healed over these games. i grew closer to the people in my group as we bonded over beating our opponents. shoutout to cormac for being a fantastic host! Coaches were so fun!! We had << crack >> as they said So fun learning/playing Gaelic games (handball, Gaelic football, hurling). The staff was great & so friendly. Would definitely recommend for your trip! Fantastic. An introduction to Gaelic sports, unique in the world. The coaches are great, the lessons are well run, and everyone ends with real, crazy matches. A must do! This is a full hearted recomendation. This workshop is such a wonderful way to learn about Irelands unique culture and Identity. The organizers and constructors were the loveliest people, making sure that everybody was included and having a good time. I went there all by myself and was integrated inmediately in the group. The sports were really fascinating and seemed more  wholesome to me than other sports: strength, balance and coordonation are being trained. Dont miss this when im Dublin! I loved everything about my experience playing gaelic games besides the fact that one of the coaches was a bully. She was so rude to me for no reason and made the experience negative for me. The other coaches we really fun but for some reason that one girl was just so rude. One of the best experiences you can get while visiting Dublin. The team here are very professional and very knowledgeable regarding the history of Irish sports which enhanced the experience. We got some lessons on how to play some of the games and just had an awesome day of fun. Whenever I visit the country again I would definitely like to visit the place again. It was completely worth it. You guys are amazing. Great welcome. The local staff is super friendly, the explanations are clear, the session allows you to understand the 3 sports well. We did it during a stag do. Ideal for a group of friends (and family). I highly recommend ! Went here for a stag party and it was truly an incredible experience. Focus was always on learning and never on being more or less fit or capable, and I loved the games as well. The staff were fantastic and helpful. It was a wonderful time. Prepare to get muddy and physical. It was hilarious. The coaches will tease you and get you to join in on the fun. Loved our experience. Loved Paul and Neal! Had so much fun with all 3 sports (Hurling, Gaelic Football,  and Gaelic Handball) Would definitely come back and is a must do for families or couples in Ireland! Absolutely recommend it!! We went with my boyfriend and my sister and we had an awesome time. The staff was so kind and thoughtful, the sports really fun and interesting!! Such a great cultural activity Totally loved it! Great fun and sporty session, definitely recommend this activity. You get a nice glimpse of local sports culture, intriguying information and actually get to play these games too. I was a bit nervous on going alone, but ended up having absolutely great craic with a bunch of stag party lads, and super friendly staff. Thanks a million! I have a company that organises trips for Spanish students and every year I bring a group to try the Gaelic experience. It cant be better. Its always one of the best memories of the teenagers on my groups. Totally recommend. Great half-day experience, we learned about the gaelic game culture in Ireland and got a work-out playing three different games. Highly recommended! It was so much fun to learn some of the national sports with such pleasant coaches. It was also so informative. We enjoyed it so much. always thrilled to get to know irish culture through their sports, which are mildly said different to what non natives think they might be... kind and professional staff, as well We had an absolutely brilliant time with EGG - we took 25 lads from an U15s rugby team and they looked after us so incredibly well. Highly recommended for a brilliant experience and incredible customer service. Thanks guys. Mick, OBRFC. Participated in Experience Gaelic Games after a heavy Friday night out in Dublin on a Stag do.  (17th Feb) The games were in incredible and the coaching team (Jono (GoalKeeper), Brian and the lovely lady who runs the talk) were fantastic. Jono was a great coach and explained how each part of the games are played on the field. I still beat him at a rally of Handball Brian is very knowledgeable and passionate about Gaelic Games. The whole stag do enjoyed the day with GGE. #RichTeas Thanks I HIGHLY recommend Gaelic Games to anyone. We had a great time learning the basics of Hurling, Gaelic Football and Handball. This was a huge highlight of Dublin. Just brilliant! Went here with a stag group and had a great time. If youre considering doing the Gaelic Games experience, just do it, you wont be disappointed. Never laughed harder with my group, it was a great day! The staff was helpful and the coaches were great! We went there to play some Hurling and Gaelic Football, good atmosphere. Amazing experience, so much fun. The company were brilliant and made everyone feel involved. Would recommend to all Was here with a stag party, every single person enjoyed the experience. From the history of the sports and learning, to actually playing game. Excellent service and would 100% recommend to try this."
72,Frank And Honest Gourmet Coffee Company,4.225,"This is a busy, friendly supermarket and food hall which is always well stocked and has a Frank & Honest self service coffee shop. You can buy any of the shops freshly made sandwiches, wraps, salads, hot food etc. Andd sit and enjoy the world go by through their large plate glass window. Popular with locals and tourists, the staff are courteous and friendly. They do a great line in good to take away on the go, if you are in the way to work or off to explore Dublin. I love it for the great light streaming in & the coffee is good also ! Great coffee and cake at half the price of Starbucks You can grab and go or sit with a latte and enjoy fresh, hot sandwiches, juices and all kinds of snacks. Oh yeah did I mention they are open 24 hours? Lots of healthy choices. I was a bit suspicious in the beginning when a barista was busy with paperwork and answered my questions without much engagement. But when I said I m into a good coffee (they have also americano from the machine) he fixed a really good one and I saw how professional he was in his process and the way he handled lines later (he works alone there). This New York style inspired barista performed quick and efficient service. The toilet was exceptionally clean. Extra points this place got from my side when I read the brochure about their company: they have compostable cups and lids, 20 cent discount for serving coffee in customers own cups and they are also Rainforest Alliance certified. Highly recommend for humble travelers who appreciate quality, reasonable prices, and well-thought concept! Good coffee means the world to us  - Frank and Honest #bemorefrankandhonest Service: 5 of 5 Food: 5 of 5 Cleanliness: 5 of 5 Price: 5 of 5 Environment-friendly: 5 of 5 A very nice cafe with delicious coffee! Its hard to find a coffee place in the morning in Temple Bar area. We came across this one on our way to bus stop. The coffee is good. It sells bakeries too. Entrance is through the mini market next door. This place is so honest that if you dont specify that you want regular coffee, the barista will make it large on his own to earn something extra. It was just a great place to have chat and coffee on a rainy morning. Good atmosphere, staff is helpful Delicious coffee and cosy atmosphere. Such a nice place, good decor, good drinks, a grocery store within the shop. Good for hanging out, or rest while sightseeing the city. Ok for a quick coffee break I loved the white hot chocolate. It was lovely together with the cafe art. Very friendly and great coffee Only place open around 8am on Saturday in Dublin. Thought this was going to be a Starbucks style coffee but it actually tasted good and the barista knew what he was doing. Also, great service. Wish I got his name cause he was on it. Cheers to whoever served me and partner this morning. Enjoyed my cappuccino and croissant And loved that I could charge my phone! :) This cafe in Aston quay is especially known for its pastries and coffee/tea. Besides internet and coffee/tea it has nice staff as it is usual in Dublin. Prices very reasonable in my opinion. Amazing coffee and lovely staffs. Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere.  Food fine but a bit limited. Dont go smelly slu.. Highly disappointed by the products. We bought luxury doughnut which was nothing but jam filled doughnut and the veg quiche was totally tasting like egg . Very very dissapointed as the products are misleading . What a great find.  Fresh made sandwiches,  and varieties of other foods,  make your own salad. Plus some of the best coffee.  Stop in for a quick bite, or take it with you. Service was great staff was helpful I ordered the lemongrass and ginger green tea and thought it was of a high standard , will definitely recommend this place to others Excellent coffee and patisserie, nice place! The staff in the Dame Street branch are awesome. Always friendly and they usually have my order ready before I ask for it! Loved sitting in the window on a very busy street watching the people going about. Staff were very polite coffee lovely. Everything you need from a coffeeshop. Added benefit is the shop from which you can also grab other things too A very nice choice of food such as breakfast menu, sandwiches, cakes, fruits and all sorts of hot drinks. My favourite for breakfast/quick lunch I am always looked after in the Frank & Honest in Lidl Rathfarnham outlet, especially by Kelly who always greets me with a smile! Not bad for a convenience store coffee shop. Espresso bar if you have the time, or convenience coffee at an island if youre in a rush. Nice coffee in dublin! Managed to eat in and grab a cappuccino! Would visit again! Nice place to have a coffee or tea and do some shopping. Nice view onto a busy street, lovely decor , standard deli food Magical place. Recommended for family and friends Nice little cafe connected to a convenience shop. Coffee was good Coffee tasted good albeit not cold enough. Seating available next to a store. Very nice and as always in Dublin friendly and efficient service! A really good place to take sandwich and hot coffee . I love it Decent coffee, quite strong, good amount of seating. Nice coffee, comfy seats but poor selection of cake."
73,GAA Museum & Tours,4.775,"Dizzying moment on the roof of the legendary Croke Park stadium, guided tour of the different views from the summit. Downside all the same, no audio guide!! Even if you master the language of Chekespeare correctly, it is complicated to understand 100% the different anecdotes of our friendly Irish guide. Kelloggs Skyline tour is a must! The museum introduces us to the ancestral Gaelic sports of the locals and allows us to understand why these sports are more considered than rugby and football in the eyes of the islanders. A very interesting tour of this stadium and the museum by Liam who was a very friendly guide. A good moment The tour of Croke Park stadium takes at least one hour or maybe a little longer. Our guide was a pleasant young man and our group was small. Initially, there has to be some walking done to get to the interesting parts of the tour. Without wishing to spoil it on prospective visitors, theres a variety to the visit and if you have any knowledge or interest of GAA sports, you should find this interesting. Really enjoyed the tour, we arrived earlier and were allowed to join earlier group instead of one hour wait. Lots of happening there, like deliveries or lawn moving what makes hard to hear the guide, but still worth it. Tour is well laid out, what makes it really interesting. Visiting places that only special guests or players go to make tour special. Lovely cafeteria/restaurant at premises with good food and perfect gift shop that only has GAA stuff. Also enjoyed museum activity area like hitting the slither or football or jumping. Funny historical facts made everyone laugh. Brilliant tour and museum of a very unique and historic stadium in Dublin. The museum is small but really informative about the roots of the GAA and its role in Irelands history. Likewise, the tour offers a great way of exploring the inner working of the ground and gives you a unique view of the stadium. Great even if you dont understand any of the GAAs sports. We had a fantastic time doing the Croke Park Tour and were so lucky to have Jess showing us around! :) She was absolutely brilliant and shared so much interesting information and history about the grounds. Loved the museum as well. Its such a nice tour to do and so reasonably priced! :) What a fantastic tour and museum. Our tour guide, Cian, was fun, personable, knowledgeable and made the whole experience that much better. Great behind the scenes look at Croke Park and a great learning experience from someone who hasn t really watched GAA. The museum was also a nice cherry on top. Spent last two hours in the company of one of the greatest sports player Ireland has, thank you Cora Staunton for your generosity and time. #bordgaisenergylegendstours what a legacy to have. Visited on We turned up to just visit the museum, but found that there was a tour around the top of the stadium, bonus, got to see Dublin from top of Croke Park. Guide made it, great crac, all in all great visit. It was a guided tour in Croke Park cost you about 16 euro for adult, I have to say I did enjoy even though I missed about 10 minutes of the video...I am so eager to do skyline tour next time...thank you Ive been to this museum at Croke Park about few times. Its a very interesting museum. Its probably one of the best museums in Ireland. Had a fantastic experience at the GAA museum Croke Park. Very professionally run and the tour guide was a natural .One of the best sporting museums Ive been to around Europe. Well priced and the Cafe at the end of the experience was a real treat. Many thanks to Liz for her friendliness and assistance at the restaurant . Stadium tour was amazing Martin was a fantastic tour guide, so enthusiastic and funny. Fantastic. I cannot believe its taken me this long to get up to Dublin and into Croker for the tour and museum. Been to plenty of games there but it was really interesting to see it from the other side. I must say, our guide Sean who hosted our tour of the stadium was a credit to the organisation. His knowledge of the GAA and Croke Park was encyclopedic. He was engaging and friendly. We were all blown away at the end of the tour to learn he had only been in the job for 1 month! What an asset. The museum itself is excellent and the Bloody Sunday exhibit was eye opening. I cannot recommend this enough, whether you are GAA mad or have never seen a match in your life there is something there for you. Top marks, 10/10 attraction. Cant help but feel proud to be Irish afterwards. Very interesting tour and brilliant day out around Croke Park Stadium, even if youre not into GAA, the tour is a very interesting experience full of not only sport, but also significant history. You get to go behind the scenes and experience what it is like for the sports players at such a venue. Our tour Guide Annette was especially lovely, engaging with everyone in the tour group and especially the kids. She provided us with some fascinating and personal nuggets of information that can only come from years of experience in her profession. Would highly recommend her and this experience to anyone. I booked a tour for this weekend however my personal plans changed due to the scheduling of a GAA event in Kerry that I wasnt aware of at the time of booking. I requested a refund to be told the policy was not to refund only in exceptional circumstances and the no refund policy was on the booking form. Fair enough it was but also was the request to send an email if you felt you were entitled to a refund. A GAA event being scheduled that I wasnt aware of when booking a GAA tour some 200kms from my home I felt were good grounds for a refund. The customer service official didnt even have the decency to sign their name to the email. Is this the way the GAA is being run now? Very poor customer service and a very distasteful experience. A really great experience brought some friends from Mexico they loved the tour and history. The tour guide was brilliant. Thank you BRILLIANT TOUR & MUSEUM! Had a great tour with Johnny, you get to see most of what Croke Park has to offer, such as the changing rooms, the corporate areas, the stands and you get some really nice views of the pitch. The museum was brilliant, very interactive with chances to test your hurling and gaelic football skills, and very educational artefacts. Also has on-site restaurant and souvenir shop, and the customer service here was excellent. Overall, definitely worht visiting if youre here in Dublin or youre a fan of GAA sports. Never knew anything about hurling after a tour and Museum visit , well educated, a must for all fans and non fans We had an amazing time. We definitely recommend the guided tour of the stadium and the museum to any tourist or local. The Skyline Tour was a really great experience. Amazing Views and different facts about Ireland. Cian was a perfect tour guide. So attentive and extremely knowledgeable. Croke Park itself is fantastic and a must see if visiting Dublin! A wonderful place for any GAA fan to Visit. Parking inside the grounds brings you virtually to the doorstep of the Museum. But this would not be available on match days. Tour guide was enthusiastic, with good stadium knowledge and very good with children. Felt like good value for money and great interactive games for the kids in the Museum part. Well worth a visit. Off the beaten track, but this should be a must! Eye opening museum about GAA, a big part of Irish sporting and parish culture. The sense of pride and grandeur for this sport is apparent. Great place to bring sports enthusiasts, those interested in Irish culture and history, and families with kids (who will be able to try their hand at some of the skills required in Gaelic football or Hurling). Great tour - our guide was knowledgae, kind, and personable.  It s not just a sports tour - you learn about the history of the GAA and how it was connected with the history of Ireland. Super day out for any GAA fan.  Skyline tour has been on the agenda for a while and glad to finally make it happen.  Gerry (with a G, from Co. Clare) was a gas tour guide, and really made it an interesting tour.  Great way to see parts of Dublin, and to see where the GAA magic happens. I really recommend the tour.  You get a bit of history and the best views of Dublin from the top of the stadium. We booked a tour for 22 French students ! It was a very enriching visit and Aydan was an amazing guide ! Thank you for everything ! Brilliant tour for the whole family. Would thoroughly recommend especially as its also great value for money. Our tour guide Ger was obviously knowledgeable as you would expect but extremely engaging too. The video at the start of the tour is beautiful. Big shout to Sarah in the coffee shop/restaurant who went out of her way to look after my elderly father. Lady on entrance gate was rude and insensitive to our issue with an injured child. She was downright nasty and short with with us and our kids. Will not attend again. We loved the tour of the stadium, our tour guide Annette was very informative and friendly. Absolutely incredible. Very informative and a great history given. A museum on Gaelic sports but also a symbolic and historical place for bloody Sunday. Full of Irish history. Amazing place. Staff brilliant. Had a brilliant day in Croke Park and then a very interesting tour. I highly recommend you to take the skyline tour, beautiful view of Dublin More sports need to follow in the footsteps of the GAA, Instead of inflating the egos of overpaid idiots and paying ludicrous money that could be put elsewhere. Fantastic place for a visit and good value for money really good tour very informative. One disappointing aspect was the restaurant I asked before our 1pm tour, which is hourly, what time the restaurant closed and was told 4pm yet at 2.30pm they had no food to serve us and our grandchildren were a very disappointed. Bank Holiday syndrome they just didnt want to work after 2 obviously. Should these people work there I dont think Really comprehensive and enjoyable tour and museum.  Well worth the entrance fee.  The museum includes lots of memorabilia, video footage and even some have a go challenges.  The only thing it lacked was an idiots guide to the rules of the GAA games which would make a good addition Great experience! Most try the walk on the roof tour and the museum!"
74,GPO Museum,4.7,"Great way to learn more about Irelands modern history. The audio guide is really terrific and the short movie is exceptionally well put together. The tour and museum explore all areas of life around the period of the Easter rising in 1916 to show the build-up and societal conditions that lead to revolution. It also covers the subsequent war for independence and the longer lasting effects. Great museum which we were fortunate enough to visit on the anniversary of the Easter Rising. A well thought out introduction to the history with exhibits, an immersive dramatised video, written information and commentary from a wide range of historians & experts. Well worth the entry fee. Step back in time at the GPO Museum, located within the historic General Post Office on OConnell Street in Dublin. This engaging museum offers a profound insight into Irelands tumultuous history, particularly the 1916 Easter Rising. Interactive exhibits and immersive narratives provide a visceral experience, capturing the pivotal moments that shaped the nation. Ideal for history enthusiasts and anyone looking to understand Irelands path to independence, the GPO Museum is a cornerstone of cultural heritage in Dublin. The GPO Museum in Dublin provides a comprehensive and immersive exploration of Irelands revolutionary history, focusing particularly on the events surrounding the Easter Rising of 1916. Housed within the historic General Post Office building, which served as the nerve center of the Rising, the museum offers visitors a unique opportunity to step back in time and experience the sights, sounds, and stories of this pivotal moment in Irish history. One of the museums standout features is the Witness History exhibition, which uses a combination of artifacts, multimedia displays, and interactive technology to bring the events of the Easter Rising to life. Visitors can follow the journey of the rebels as they plan and execute the Rising, experiencing the chaos and confusion of battle through immersive audiovisual presentations. The museum also delves into the broader context of Irish history, exploring the social, political, and economic factors that contributed to the rise of Irish nationalism and the desire for independence. From the Great Famine to the Land War, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped Irelands struggle for self-determination. In addition to its focus on the Easter Rising, the GPO Museum highlights the contributions of key figures in Irish history, including James Connolly, Padraig Pearse, and Countess Markievicz. Personal stories, letters, and artifacts provide insights into the lives and motivations of these individuals, offering a more intimate perspective on the events of the time. Through its engaging exhibits and educational programs, the GPO Museum seeks to promote understanding, dialogue, and reflection on Irelands revolutionary past and its relevance to contemporary society. It serves as a reminder of the enduring spirit of resilience, courage, and determination that defined the Irish people in their quest for freedom and independence. In this historical building you can meet the history of Ireland of the last 100 years. It s easy to visit as in the city centre. You should take audio guide as it will help you expand you knowledge and understand many historical facts in details. You may need about 1 hour to visit it. Worth combine it with another museum in the city centre for a lovely morning city excursion! Great tour and its must if you want to learn some great Irish History Nice old building. Staff are friendly and helpful. I enjoyed buying some gifts from here that shows the lovely Irish culture Very beautiful museum to absolutely do in Dublin. I loved ! Great history museum. Highly informative on irish history. Great place. For first time iny life I understood how the 1916 rebellion came about. The historians video summaries taken together gives a full understanding of events. A must do visit for everyone in Ireland.... as well as tourists. When we were on a tour of Dublin, the guide told us about this museum. We didn t go into the museum because we had very little time because we had a short trip. And so the guide said that those who have a very interesting history are advised to visit this museum next time. It was absolutely amazing. Anybody who is interested in the  history. Of all those times.Would love it. Staff there exceptionally helpful. I lost my debit card and they went down all avenues until we found it. The young gentleman who showed us around was very learned and good clear diction which the whole journey most interesting. He knew EVERYTHING. Its one of the most significant places in Irish history. If youre history lover, Im sure you will love this place. For adults, entry fee is 17 euro, and heard that students will get some consession in the  entry fee. I went with my history obsessed teen. This is very interesting, and definitely worth the money! There are videos, original items in show cases, timelines, and re-created walls with posters etc from the time. And of course being in the building where it happened is fascinating too! There is a nice, small cafe and you can relax in the courtyard in good weather. I will say there are a LOT of facts and figures, which can be a bit overwhelming, especially for kids I imagine. Fantastic museum. Great film show and loads of  succinct info. Really brought it home how it actually all played out. Very thought provoking. Visited for the guided tour, our guide was very passionate about the subject matter which really showed in her delivery of the tour. The exhibition itself is nicely executed and very interactive, I would consider it more of a modern museum despite not as focused on touch-screen interaction in comparison to EPIC but it is definitely worth the visit. The gift shop has a nice variety of items and surprisingly not as tourist-y yay Irish as I thought it would be Spent about two hours and really appreciated learning about the history of the Easter Monday uprising. The building and current services are also amazing. Of all the parts of the museum, the film is the most interesting. But the cinematography is a wee bit disorienting. Directions from station to station of the self guided your were hard to follow. Overall a good experience. The museum has an impressive collection of documents, photos, audio and memorabilia, including first-hand accounts, of the Easter Rising 1916. It could be better organized, and I found it difficult to figure out what order I was meant to use moving from display to display. Still, it was quite interesting. Excellent experience, would highly recommend. The audio visual was also very well done at explaining the events of the 1916 Rising. Very good value for money also - spent around an hour in here in total Its a very interesting tour. Handy if you just have a few hours to kill midday because its right in the GPO in the heart of OConnell St. I really enjoyed my time here. It has one of the best immersive film ive seen in a musuem. Its about 18mins long and recaps the events leading up to the 1916 rising, I love their Irish accent in it. Location wise, you cant get any better than OConnell Street. Its a small museum though, you can easily finish the musuem in half an hour if you rush so abit expensive at  15.Theres only 18 audio files in the guided tour but if you want to learn about the 1916 rising, this is the place to be. Definitely not the largest museum, but however well worth if you are visiting Dublin. Especially, if you are like myself and aware of some of Irish history, but not really educated on it. Learned a great deal about a specific part of this countrys history.  Exhibits are very informative and well done.  On a separate note, the gift shop is also convienent for buying a post card if you need to send one to friends/family back home (with stamps readily available at the Post Office counters across the entry way). At last I managed to visit this popular museum.  Well thought out and presented!! I enjoyed my time alone here taking in the information in my own time and at my own pace!! Best post office I have been to. Friendly staff and there was an Irish traditional Christmas concert treat event today. I noticed that a bunch of Muslims who came in a group verbally disapproved of the event and maybe its only a matter of time when, given their current numbers, such Christmas treats will be a thing of the past in Dublin. This place is full of history. They have a bathroom at the cafe and a museum (not free) remembering the slaying of Irish nationals by the British. This is the best place I visited in Dublin and will come back here again for an original Irish  Christmas treat while it last. General post office museum has an impressive exhibition about the 1916 Irish uprising, also known as The Easter Rising (Irish: Eiri Amach na Casca). In 1916 this building was captured by the Irish rebel forces and used as their headquarters. The museum explains in great details the events that led the uprising. The museum runs a very interesting mini movie that allows to better immerce into these events.The museum also provides you with an audio guide. The staff is very nice and friendly. They are supper knowledgeable and can answer your questions about the museum. Was at the talks at the museum today Sat. 15th June regarding Joyce .  4 Fantasic talks and beautiful harp recital .  It was free.  What a wonderful idea.  Thank you for a lovely treat. This is a tour that is close to my own heart, As my great-grandfather fought in the rising and the years that followed. Have taken the tour three times at this stage. If you like your history then this a tour well worth taking it tells the story of a very exciting  time in Irish history. A great exhibition, with most of the basics covered (a lot left out), replica costumes and posters, interactive touch screen displays. Audio and displays throughout, so dont bother with headphones unless your not fluent in the English language. The main film was of blockbuster top quality and on a huge screen. Great value. The staff was really sweet, thats always a plus on my list! As for the museum, I really liked the video showing the Easter Rising of 1916 that took place in Dublin. Apart from that, I found the exhibition a bit poor for the price. It was nice overall but not a must for your bucket list. If you had to choose between this museum and the museum of Ireland Emigration I would recommend the latter 100%. Its one of the best museum Ive been too. Enjoy your stay in Dublin peps, Cheers, Wouldnt hesitate to recommend this. It helps explain important 20th century Irish history on the spot. You need enough time to walk around, maybe up to 2 hours but you could spend more because the information on offer is extensive and well presented. One of the highlights of our trip and we dont necessarily head for museums on a city break. Loved learning the history and plight of the Irish people fighting for their freedom. Great exhibit! Must see when visiting Dublin especially if you love history! We d recommend coming here as one of your first stops in Dublin to give yourself a grounding in modern Irish history. It s helpful to appreciate other museums and the Gaol, as well as the modern buildings that you will see. The ticket pricing is reflective of the quality of the museum and you get a free audio tour which is an essential for maximum tourism knowledge. We would say the information here was greater than anything shown or written in the displays. There is a short video which takes about 20 minutes, so bring a coat, a pillow or lover that you re willing to sit on. We were in the museum for 2 hours so had no time for the cafe, so we can t help you there sorry. Very well done visit with audio headset, I highly recommend if you want to learn more about Irish history! Great gift shop tickets for the museum are kinda pricey compared to epic. However tickets may be worth it as this building is important to history. Easter Sunday commemoration marks 107 years since 1916 Rising President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar attend ceremony outside the GPO Not as interesting as some other museums about Irish History. The audio guides were easy to use but not very entertaining. The short film was decent enough and we learned a few bits about the Easter rising. It would be good if there was a stronger angle about the role of the post office during this time period as the museum was situation in the post office itself + the staff were very helpful. Very interesting, a dive into Irish history. On the other hand, we avoid coffee, they serve without warning that it is closing time (so take to go) and forget to give the slices of cake paid for 1 minute earlier Fascinating place and history.  Having later sat out the 6 year war on fascism this is the only Irish building ever destroyed in war and this museum takes you through the hour by hour battle over the day and of the heroes who fought there for these long hours. The museum isnt really about a post office, it actually tells the story of the Easter Rising which I found more interesting! The exhibition is mainly on one room downstairs and doesnt take too long to go around, theres video booths you can sit an watch the a larger theatre section that tells the main story and goes on for a bout 15-20 mins."
75,Garda Siochana Memorial Garden,4.413793103448276,"A lovely garden located in the grounds of the castle, also the entrance to the Chester Beaty museum, which is definitely worth a visit. Very humbling to visit this garden and pay respects. I spent a few quiet moments just taking in the ambience. Definitely woyh a visit if you are in this area. Lovely addition to the park, Hidden from views by Old walls An Garda Siochana Memorial Garden honours the members of An Garda Siochana who were killed in the service of the State. The names of the members of An Garda Siochana who were killed are inscribed in stone within the garden. Additionally, a specially commissioned glass sculpture commemorates the sacrifice of the families left behind and a specially commissioned stone sculpture is a tribute to all deceased members of An Garda Siochana, the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Garda Siochana Memorial Garden The reproduction of a Zen garden with Irish style. Three modern sculptures in a corner of the small castle park. We go there, we see and we leave. Not very interesting and visit the park in 10 minutes. Good walk This place is a very beautifully maintained dedication to men and women or Garda. Respect for all the Gardai who have dedicated their life s to keeping order and peace amongst their citizens and go above the call of duty to doing what is right for the people of Dublin. Lots of respect to those who deserve it. Nice place Awesome park for sun bathing. Such a peaceful surrounding. If I have the time, would love to stay there and enjoy the surrounding. Quiet, hidden memorial. Worth finding and visiting! A lot of beauty put into this tranquil location! Beautiful gem for some peace in the heart of the city centre. Tranquil memorial garden to the fallen Garda. Respect. Lovely walk. The flowers are beautiful Beautiful place to visit. Remember those who fell in service. Lushly garden. Great time here. **** Lovely garden. Rest in peace Jardin conmemorativo por los miembros de la An Garda Siochana muertos en servicio. Junto al castillo y se accede desde el mismo jardin frente al castillo, no podeis dejar de visitarlo. No os ocupara mucho tiempo y podreis ver un trocito diferente del jardin. Jest st d bardzo  adny widok na zamek ,       ,             ! nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan"
76,Garden of Remembrance,4.7,"Really beautiful place. Its a nice place to spend some time. Its very well kept with nice flowers and plenty of seating. Absolutely beautiful place to chill out and relax listening to the birds singing Wonderful peaceful place to remember those who fought for our freedom Beautifull place and well maintained.  They have lots of benches to sit and relax. Definitely worth a visit Opened by De Valera in 1966 to commemorate all those who lost their lives in the pursuit of Irish freedom.  It s well maintained and a little tranquil oasis in the middle of Dublin city.  There s a few steps down to it but there s also a lift.  There s lots of seating and a good spot to hide away from the blustery weather.   Not sure about car parking nearby and there s no toilets but the writer s museum is beside it and a few other spots.  One of the hop on/off buses stops beside it. Beautiful place, it would be perfect to visit on a sunny day! If you come to Dublin you need to take a walk to the garden of remembrance it s a beautiful park with lists of Irish history put it on your to do list in Ireland A very calm link, full of emotion and history, where it is pleasant to go We discovered this memorial by chance while walking through the streets of Dublin. This is dedicated to the memory of all those who gave their lives for the cause of Irish freedom and clearly do not hesitate to stop there to enjoy the calm of this place, it is beautiful and peaceful. Its very peace here and a lovely place to sit and reflect with plenty of benches. Be sure to take a look at the Swan sculpture at the back and read about the story of Lir. Ive loved this garden so much, either for its meaning and appearance. The flowers have bright colors, like red and pink, and they seem so looked after, because they cant be so beautiful without any human help. Unfortunately, the water is so dirty and full of leaves and dead insects... It should be cleaned! It ruins the beauty of the garden! Hope theyll do that. We stumbled upon this by chance while spending a long weekend in Dublin and it is a beautiful, yet peaceful place. It is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Beautiful place to rest from the city center long walks. You cannot sit on the grass but there are plenty of benches and stairs. The statue of the four people dying and transforming into swans represents an old Irish legend, the legend of the children of Lir. Don t miss the tale because when you see the statue it makes you goosebumps. Parking available, lovely area to walk around - rose garden, blossom trees, (pond could do with a clean) The memorial aspect of the park is beautiful - its also a park within a park - large green areas for dogs. You can also walk along the liffey towards Chapelizod village Quiet spot to eat a snack while resting from touring town. Designed by Daithi Hanky and dedicated to the memory of all those gave their lives in the cause of Irish Freedom. The centre piece of the garden is a statue by Oisin Kelly, based on the legend Children of Lir, where the children were casted a spell and turned into swans. This embodies the spirits of those Irish who though had fallen for their country, but risen for freedom. The front of the garden sinks down in the shape of a cross, with a water feature echoes the same shape, reflecting the trees and plants nearby. There are wooden benches along side the stone walls for people to sit and commemorate the Irish heros. There is a lift at the entrance opposite the City Gallery for wheelchair users. My overall impression of the garden is well kept, clean and aesthetic. Didnt see any rubbish anywhere. You can safely sit on those lovely wooden benches without worrying birds droppings  People were rather friendly--  they were sitting down or walking by, whenever they saw us, no one just looked always awkwardly but maintained eye contact either noded or smiled. Even the skateboarder stopped, smiled and gave way to us. Quite impressed. Always a nice quiet place to get away from the hustle and bustle to reflect on fallen heroes. Brilliant, With a fantastic monument and vibe At a cannabis reform march in the garden on remembrance, came up to show my hemp collection, good turn out. Guest speakers, banners, march, music and cannabis. Civil disobedience at its best. Gorgeous garden. Sat here and had lunch, so quiet and peaceful. They have a lift for people with limited mobility (please see the pictures). Its a very small garden but it is very pretty with the architectural pond and the flower arrangements. If youre near by its worth checking it out. It also offers some historical aspects! Hidden in the heart of the city, Nice for a short walk and to learn some Irish history Lots of seats to sit and enjoy surroundings. Very pretty park with a pond, flowers and benches. Quiet and pleasant. Beautiful place to visit and an amazing day yesterday at the commemoration for the stardust families Its such a beautiful park too. Its small, but it doesnt make it less. Actually its a calm place and you can take a lot os pictures right there. Beautiful small garden. The meaning is fabulous. But its a little bit dirty. Lovely place to sit and relax away from the hustle and bustle of nearby OConnell Street. It was opened in 1966 in remembrance of those who gave their lives for Irelands independence. A nice quiet spot to go to sit in the city outdoors to relax or to just meet mates for a chat! The monument is nice and there is plenty of benches for seating!  Wheelchair accessible The Garden of Remembrance is a memorial garden dedicated to the memory of all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish Freedom. The garden is roughly a rectangle except in the centre where there is a cruciform shaped sunken water pool. At the top of the cruciform and up some steps stands a sculpture called Children of Lir, an Irish myth allegory to the rebirth and resurrection of Ireland. Lovely and peaceful place to sit and relax. You can enjoy sitting alone or with your friend(s)! It was ok statue is nice other than that not much to see just a load of lads smoking weed Really peaceful place to go and you can just relax its a place ever since l can remember l would just go in with my Son he loved the water! I havent been there in a while! The last time we were there we were Protestant about making Canabis legal! Lovely place to visit. Nice and tranquil. Would love to visit in the summer when all the flowers are in full bloom. A place full of emotion that you absolutely must see when you are in Dublin. Reflection is welcome there. In memory of those who lost their lives for the independence of Ireland. Beautiful, peaceful spot.  Quiet place in the middle of Dublin Side entrance opposite Hugh Lane Gallery, dirty, someone had either urinated ot spilt beer. There were 4 destitutes drinking outside this side gate. Dublin is not what it used to be ! There should be a warden on site. Love the time out here and has been the starting point of Dublin Pride and other marches for over 30 years A great place to escape the commotion of the inner city. A legend has it that the statute is A retelling of ancient the Irish myth of King Lir, his four children and his powerful wife Aoife, that forms the basis the of the ballet classic, Swan Lake. It goes on to say Many years ago, in ancient Ireland lived a King and ruler of the sea, called Lir. He had a beautiful wife, called Eva, who gave him four children   eldest son Aodh, a daughter called Fionnula and twin boys, Fiachra and Conn. When children were young, their mother Eva died. Lir and children were very sad, and King wanted a new mother for his young sons and daughter, so he married Eva s sister Aoife who, it was said, possessed magical powers. Aoife loved the children and Lir at first, but soon she became very jealous of the time that King spent with Aodh, Fionnula, Fiachra, and Conn. She wanted to have all of his attention for herself. One day, she took children to swim in a lake while the sun was hot in the sky. When they got there and children took to the water, Aoife used her powers to cast a spell over children, which would turn them all into beautiful swans. She knew that if she killed children, their ghosts would haunt her forever, so instead, she cast this spell, forcing them to live as swans for 900 years; three hundred on Lake Derravaragh, three hundred on Straits of Moyle, and three hundred more on Isle of Inish Glora. The spell would only be broken when children heard the ringing of a bell, and arrival of St. Patrick in Ireland. But Aoife s spell had not taken away children s voices, and so it was that these four beautiful swans could sing beautiful songs and were able to tell their father what had happened to them. Lir, who had been searching for his children, came down to the lake and saw Fionnuala, now a swan, who told him of spell cast on them by Aoife. Enraged, he banished Aoife into the mist, and she was never seen again. Although saddened by his children s fate, Lir remained a good father and spent his days faithfully by the lake listening to their singing. Their three hundred years on Lake Derravaragh were filled with joy, but at end of this first part of their spell, children had to say goodbye to their father forever. They travelled to Straits of Moyle, where they spent three hundred years enduring fierce storms and spent much time separated from each other. But they survived these three hundred years, and eventually traveled, together again, to fulfil final stage of their spell, on a small saltwater lake on Isle of Inish Glora. The King by now had passed, and of his once glorious castle nothing but ruins remained. One day, they heard the distant ringing of a bell   one of the first Christian bells in all of Ireland   and swans followed the sound, knowing that end of their spell was near. They followed bells to house of a holy man called Caomhog, who cared for them for last years of their fate. One day though, disaster struck again, when a man appeared at house dressed in armor, saying he was King of Connacht, and he had come for now legendary and mystical swans with beautiful singing voices. He threatened to tear down and ruin Caomhog s house if swans did not come with him, but just as he was laying his hands on them, bell tolled again, and mist of lake came and enveloped swans, turning them back into children they were nine hundred years before. The frightened King of Connacht fled immediately, and children in their human form started to age rapidly. Caomhog knew that they soon would die, so he quickly christened them before their human bodies passed away, so that their legend and their names could live on forever, for these were Children of Lir. An amazing peaceful spot to sit and reflect.  It sits lower than street level and gives the impression of being an oasis in the city. Its a beautiful place for sitting and seeing the view of the water. Also, the sculpture at the top of the stairs. Its an amazing view"
77,Gerard's Cafe,4.545454545454546,"Just bought crisps there now and started eating them as soon as I got on the bus to see they were 4 days out of date. As if its not already bad enough paying  1.50 for a bag of crisps. Gave 2 stars because the staff are always super friendly in their though! First good coffee I drink in Dublin ! Thank you ! The muffin was delicious as well ! Very friendly staff who work very hard. The panini s are very good and the prices are okay if comparing to the little shop in the bus station. Great place to have a coffee if waiting for your coach. Perfect place to grab a Coffee while you wait for your bus, it is inside Busaras bus station. They have Cranberry sandwiches that taste like a rainbow   unicorn galloping over a waterfall. Shame that the place is as smaller than a decimal. Seriously the place must have a height restriction, Anyone 64 or over not allowed in. incredibly friendly and helpful staff + delicious coffee!! 5/5 Great hot chocolate nan nan nan nan"
78,Giants Causeway Tour,4.775,"Went with Finn McCool tour as we had good experience from the last time we took the tour of Glendenlough. This time it was the Giants Causeway and Belfast, the tour guide was great and gave some great insights into the cultural and political background of the region along with some great music too. Time at Causeway was enough but limited at Belfast. It was great experience overall. Would recommend. Absolutely stunning and must do trip when you re in Northern Ireland  the rock formations here is a wonder and the views are amazing. Make sure to pack your jacket as it can get really windy and chilly Great walks, stunning views avoid visitor centre just a trap free toilets up at hotel and free to go to giants causeway. This was such an amazing tour!! I like it more than cliffs of moher just bc of how much there was to do. Also the drivers are absolutely AMAZING we heard Irish mythology stories, pub songs, and learned a lot of history about Ireland. Money very well spent Extraordinary experience that truly bridged the natural beauty of Norther Ireland with the fictional world of Game Of Thrones.  Flip our personal tour guide was such a pleasure to spend the day with. His passion for GOT and for sharing his knowledge from an insider perspective as well as a geological perspective were so appreciated. We filled our day with challenging walks and funny banter from our first meeting to our final goodbye,  Flip made traveling to Ireland after a two and half year wait just exceed my expectations of what this trip could be during winter.  While it was very cold and windy touring the natural sights, Flips ability to transport you back into the GOT movies and envision being there was a bit mind blowing.  I was indeed so happy to have Flips s one on one attention and careful guidance as compared to the big bus tours that would sometimes arrive with no sight guidance. Flips insider GOT s movie experience and stories made you feel like you had joined and insider community and you had front row tickets.  Booking a personalized private tour with Flip will make you feel like you won the lottery as well as gained a new friend in Belfast. I can honestly say that with all the personalized tours that I have experienced around the world that Flip delivers the most personal, in-depth and curated experience which can only be a 5 STAR rating. Loved the hiking & nature! Very relaxing! Absolutely fabulous tour, the nature and amazing views! I took a day tour and it was perfect. Professional with some interesting stories about the place. Amazing tour the 12 hours went by so quick. Gerard was a fantastic tour guide made everything lively and fun diving into the rich Ireland history, Fred the driver was courteous and always made the drive feel safe. Highly recommend for any traveler looking to book exciting tour of Ireland Wild rover day tours Best tour EVER!!!!!! Review of Titanic Belfast Visitor Experience and Giant s Causeway Day Trip from Dublin We went on the tour Wednesday, September 25. We are fortunate enough to reserve the two front seats (I highly recommend that you book early and do this). Our first trip to Ireland, bucket list events, and our anniversary!!!! We had great expectations. It s an early morning for most people, however the excitement of the day is ehanced by the driver and the guide. Our guide JP and our driver Damien they were beyond excellent the banter between the two was entertaining, humorous and actually educational !!! JP and D ....show coming soon..,. Unlike other tours they stop for a bathroom break so you re not on the bus more than two hours. You have plenty of time to see the sights and more than enough time in Belfast. We chose the black limo tours and it was excellent,we asked others on the bus how the titanic tour went and it seems like everybody had the same word ... excellent. Wear comfortable shoes,there is a lot of walking, bring snacks and water and don t chicken out at the rope bridge, you ll regret it .... You get into town around 8pm, a long day,however it goes by quite fast. Thanks to wild Rover tours, JP, Damien and of course John ...You all rock! I highly recommend this to everyone !!!!! Staff is very helpful to choose the perfect tour according to the time that you have. I really enjoyed it, it was a wonderful trip with a nice driver. We left and came back perfectly on time so no stress to take back the luggages at the hotel before taking the plane ! Will do it again as soon as I come back ! I don t need to say, the place is beautiful and amazing!! So the only reason for not giving 5 stars: Staff:  There was not a single smiling eye. I know it s Covid times but really, do you have to be angry as well? We are coming up from ROI and miss the friendliness and hospitality that we get there. Definitely worth a visit! Be sure to check the weather if possible. Sunny is better than rain and wind when visiting! One of the place we ever visited in our life time It was good. I wish agent told me about the additional charges to enter above or below after going through this building to see more. Great tour guide Paul. Lots of wacky facts about the little people but amazing luck with the weather. Really worthwhile trip from Dublin. amazing tour and the drive was long but omg was it worth it in the end breath taking Never a bad moment with paddywagon.... Fabulous trip.. Best weather.. Even made a best friend.... Love it Around 50 to 60 million years ago,[3] during the Paleocene Epoch, Antrim was subject to intense volcanic activity, when highly fluid molten basalt intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive lava plateau. As the lava cooled, contraction occurred. Horizontal contraction fractured in a similar way to drying mud, with the cracks propagating down as the mass cooled, leaving pillarlike structures, which are also fractured horizontally into biscuits. In many cases the horizontal fracture has resulted in a bottom face that is convex while the upper face of the lower segment is concave, producing what are called ball and socket joints. The size of the columns is primarily determined by the speed at which lava from a volcanic eruption cools.[8] The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns seen today. The basalts were originally part of a great volcanic plateau called the Thulean Plateauwhich formed during the Paleocene.[9] #heritageofireland Lovely place. Allow a few hours for hiking around the cliffs if you have time I dislike complain yet the leisure center was occupied by long cyclist ques. Outstanding! Was wet and wild 10/10. Tour,landscape,organisation and vocals of our guide John. You have to experience this place to really appreciate it. Stunningly beautiful. Only place in the world like this (didnt fact check) I just love the place. Cool Nice organized trip to Giant Causeway Amazing Cool rocks Nice holiday like it! A must visit! Unbelievable rock formation Has de venir y pasear por este maravilloso paraje natural.

79,Ginger Cafe,4.45,"Unpretentious place offering substantial, yummy and simple fare at affordable prices. Very friendly service. Had soup of the day (potato & leek), panini sandwich, ham & cheese omelette. Highly recommend the chai latte and matcha latte. Cafe opens early, great for early birds. Vegetarian options: Veg noodles, veg breakfast available Ordered a vanilla latte with a ham and cheese omelette. Everything exceeded my expectation, the coffee was delicious and the food was outstanding! Very great place for a nice brunch or breakfast meal. Other customers around me ordered paninis, they looked delicious as well. I will definitely return and recommend to others to come visit! One of the finest coffee shops in Dublin. Love my cappuccino from here, Coffee is top tier. Nice seating area , The staffs are extremely friendly, Theres a reason this place is busy.strongly recommended Got very sick after today s breakfast (bad vomiting, diarrhea). Already contacted the cafe directly on Facebook and requested they check the products thoroughly. They expressed regret and apologized. Friendly place with amazing coffee. We stopped in for a late breakfast. Constant stream of sit down and take away customers.  Awesome neighborhood place. Cute little spot on Fancis Street couple blocks from my hotel. Fresh, delicious and filling for a very reasonable price. Lovely place for breakfast. Small place run by some lovely girls who were very attentive and friendly. Food was great, the place was nice. Prices were good. Just go here if youre wondering where to go for breakfast, you wont regret it. We went on 14 June 2024. Really enjoy this cafe. Its the most reasonably priced on Francis street. Their service is quick and polite. They have a large selection of hot drinks. They also have a very community centric notice board which I havent seen in the other local cafes. Its a good notice board to see whats going on in the local area, from classes to gigs and even local medical clinics. Having a resource like this is very helpful. --Updated review-- Continues to be a lovely cafe, prices havent increased. Of the cafes on Francis street its the only one Id call a Greasy Spoon, with tasty, hot, fried food wraps, sandwiches and rolls. Seems very popular with local BIMM students. Continues to have up to date community news and events on their notice board which is helpful and informative. Great fruit smoothie, Chai latte is also tip top Really loved their homemade scones Give it a try , you won t regret Recommended dishes Fruit Scone Perfect litte cafe, no frills, great service, great prices, yummy food, love the music! A delicious and inexpensive breakfast. Tea and bread are included. Cozy cafe with small and large options for some dishes at good prices A very cozy place with great Irish breakfast moved to france from australia five months ago and i ve been craving a proper breakfast sandwich for so long, they absolutely hit the spot here. maybe one of the best i ve ever had. and the service was really good - super speedy and nice atmosphere. My first irish breakfast and it was great. There is a great choice of breakfast. The waitresses are very nice. Can be recommended. The prices are very appropriate Staff are nothing short of the nicest people I ve ever met in my entire life. The food on the other hand had to be one of the worst experiences I ve ever had. I m not sure what the black and white pudding were, but they weren t food. Sausages were mush. Coffee is average at best. If you want sit somewhere and not buy anything then this is the place for you! Food is inexpensive and average. We needed a quick sandwich and stopped in. The staff was nice. Our panini barely had any meat and the cheese was barely warm. Nice little restaurant. Affordable and tasty breakfast. Near by St. Patrick church by few steps. Was surprised to see this Cafe. Fresh made breakfast with reasonable price . We were trying to visit Dublin on a budget and this little cafe offered the best price/value for their food. The staff were all very kind and the food was delicious too! Definitely recommend! chill atmosphere with really friendly staff! Would definitely recommend for a quick bite of breakfast/brunch. Affordable and good food!! What more could you want? Great family owned and operated breakfast joint. Great little place.. coffee was perfect. Homemade soup and then homemade noodles were really good. Friendly staff and afordable prices, what more could you ask for :) Thank you guys Good early spot for breakfast. The big breakfast is filling, the small breakfast is a sufficient portion too! Great little cafe, go here after college sometimes and the coffee is amazing! Found this cute tiny cafe on our last day in Dublin trying to pass the time. Located closely to St Patrick s Cathedral and only a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar, this cafe offers fairly good food and coffee at a decent price. We were served two coffees accompanied by their homemade daily soup and two breakfasts. Friendly staff and quiet area, would recommend to people wanting to enjoy their morning coffee without the buzz of the city. I had a very bad poisoning after pasta for lunch at this place. It was already precooked, only God knows for how long it was staying there. I started feeling already weird after 1-2 hours, while barbing with pasta aftertaste. In 3-4 hours, it was basically a game over for me and my day Cafe is fairly small. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Very friendly staff. Food was great and very filling portion size Great atmosphere, great food, great coffee. What more could you ask for? Located no more than a couple of minutes from St Patricks Cathedral and park this is an excellent place to get a proper Irish breakfast inside you! Coffee isnt bad either! Very nice place. Great food. Affordable. At this point in time (2023-10-12), the menu list is not up to date. Prices have increased. Large Irish breakfast is now 12 euros. Still a very fair price. I think. Food : 5/5 Perfect little and cozy  spot for a sunday grub, matcha late was   deli. Very good and speedy service will defo comeback. We went for a full irish was a good portion but found bacon very fatty an cold and good bit of greace on plate but over all was good Very friendly staff. Great food great atmosphere. Great spot for breakfast and/or lunch Decent cup of coffee and the service was fine. However the breakfast was poor quality, from the bread to the sausages. All cheap ingredients with not much taste. Sadly won t be returning Really nice cafe with a friendly staff ! We stopped here to take breakfast. The egg sandwich tastes really good ( Le pain de mie est tres moelleux compare au notre en France avec un gout un peu different, ca surprend au debut mais cetait tres bon! ) They ask you if you want butter and what kind of sauce do you want too. I ordered a hot chocolate and all I can say is : Delicious ! The chocolate was really tasty, I recommend it ! My bf ordered a scone, really nice too. Well, dont hesitate to order something here, you wont be disappointed :D Amazing food loved it people are so nice nice little cafe, food tastes very good and the hot chocolate I had, was one of the best Ive ever had Simple but exactly what I look for in a cafe. Tasty breakfast, nice coffee , great staff , not too busy , generous portion sizes at a very fair price. Although what they offer isnt anything fancy , for the above reasons , it is one of my favourite cafes"
80,Go City(r) - Dublin,3.576923076923077,"I had a great experience using the 7 attraction choice pass in Dublin! Used it for the hop on hop off bus, night bus tour, Guinness storehouse, Jameson whiskey tour, Irish rock n roll museum, epic emigration museum, and st Patrick s cathedral! Great value. We only have 2 days in Dublin, so we selected the main  3 attractions we want to visit. The adult 3 attractions Explorer pass seemed perfect for our needs. I bought 2 x passes only to find out once I had downloaded the passes that each pass has a value of  115. Our planned 3 attractions come to  124. I tried phoning the Go City UK number. Couldnt get through, so I gave up and then spent over 30 minutes on the Go City Chat, which, by the way, leaves a lot to be desired. To sum up, the pass can not be used for our three attractions, so we will have to rethink our plans. I wont be using any GoCity passes again. It was not clear that when buying the 3 day pass, you could only use the hop on/hop off bus for one calendar day.   It seemed nice at first to have so many attractions in one place until you realize that most require external reservations ahead of time so you end up digging through emails to find both the reservation/ticket AND having to provide the pass QR code.   This would have been cheaper/easier to book separately.   Especially considering you dont have access to the bus to get to most attractions after day 1. If you want to visit Dublin, dont hesitate to take this pass. We took it 3 days and didnt even get to do all the attractions offered. Well worth paying  230 for 3 and we made a saving of  250 on our visits. You save loads of money if you plan to visit the distelleries, museums and cathedrals. The Dublin Pass comes in handy. Dont buy it if you doing a handful of attractions. The one day all inclusive pass worked great.  Hop-on Hop-off bus with access to lots of the major things to see and do in Dublin. We found this hardly usable and ended up spending extra money for things that should have been included as systems werent working to take reservations.  I requested a partial refund to cover extra expenses incurred and it was rejected. The tour operator, despite numerous attempts to contact them,  did not return any messages. It ruined my day. We used it as a taxi service. It worked perfect for us especially after going to distillery s and brewery. Unfortunately Ive been unable to make any contact either by phone or email for the past number of days after numerous attempts trying both. The irony is that on their publicity ads they offer an old fashioned phone call or prompt response to an email, however neither materialised in my case. I would be very reluctant to recommend this to others. They broke the handle of one of the luggages we stored here. Definitely avoid storing your luggages here Great pass, gives you ample of choices to do for your visit to Dublin Always buy the Dublin Pass saves loads of money Poco chiari nel contratto inviato  per lo piu molte attrazioni non siamo entrati perche ci hanno imposto degli orari assurdi poi lo sponsorizzano tutto incluso per 24 ore mentre il Bigbus e solo per un giorno abbiamo dovuto pagare un supplemento per circolare il secondo giorno una stella data e pure troppo. Wir haben den Dublinpass fur 3 Attraktionen ausgewahlt und waren sehr zufrieden. Wenn man vorher schaut, welche Attraktionen am teuersten sind, kann man einiges an Kosten sparen. Besonders gut fanden wir, dass man sofern keine Reservierung notwendig ist, spontan entscheiden kann, welche Sehenswurdigkeiten man besucht Buena opcion para visitar Dublin. Compramos el de dos dias y ha resultado muy util y provechoso. Sin esperar colas para  entrar, es una herramienta practica y economica con el fin de ver la mayoria de las atracciones turisticas que ofrece la ciudad. ,                                            . Un pacco grande alla distilleria non ne parliamo proprio ci hanno fatto stare tre ore di attesa cambiarono lorario continuamente Zeker het geld waard! En ideaal met de qr-code. Der Pass lohnt sich ziemlich schnell! Producto que ofrecen caro para lo que puedes hacer con ello nan nan nan nan nan nan"

Clodagh was a great tour guide and you could tell shes a food expert. It was so well thought out generally. The food and craic along the way was fantastic, and it was great learning about traditional and emerging Dublin and Irish cuisine.

Unforgettable Dublin Food Tour with Chef Clodagh! I did the food tour with Chef Clodagh with my brother and it was an absolute highlight of our trip to Dublin!

83,Grattan Bridge,4.55,"Probably one of the best locations to take beautiful pictures of Dublin. I was too lazy to, but that doesnt mean you should be. The walkways are spacious and connect the two most popular regions of Dublin together. When the water is flat and the sky has beautiful clouds, it s perfect for a photo. I love landscapes and every day is a different one, in the same place. I used it to make music with lots of people listening to it Good views up and down the Liffey with south facing seats for warm sunny days Only place where we were able to see the New Years fireworks....but it is very short and not extraordinary A relatively wide bridge where you can actually sit on. It offers some scenic views of Dublins buildings along the river. The water wasnt really pleasant to look at, and the smells were not that great. Birds are bothering is and pooping every where. There were seats but most were not clean. However, it had fantastic street at in view, so it was worth the walk. One of many bridges that cross the River Liffey. Its a lovely experience walking across the Grattan bridge when sun is about to set and bridge is glowing beautifully with colorful street lights. Splendid view. I went there to find silver coins left by tarxnyc    you can find him on insta he usually do that stuff hide gold and silver somewhere around the world and interested individual can find that and take it home One of the 24 bridges in Dublin. Nice spot Beautiful bridge, nothing more to say Beautiful environment with cool breeze. Excellent experience A magnificent bridge where you can stop and take some pretty photos, and the photos vary greatly depending on the weather. A spot of choice for any photographer! Use caution and be aware of your surroundings. There were drunks and others impaired along the bridge and the wooden walkways that run parallel to the water. Passed groups of young boys yelling profanities, slurs, and throwing rocks at people. A man got up from the benches and started walking quickly towards me so much so that my husband repositioned to walk between me and the man. All was early afternoon in broad daylight This specific bridge is where I first got emotionally attached to Ireland. I was standing on that bridge and I busted out crying, I didnt want to go or come back home at the time. I cant wait to go back someday. Pleasant stroll along the bustling banks of the River Liffey in Dublin. Bridges and footbridges invite you to stroll in this beautiful Irish city. The Grattan Bridge likes to resemble that of Westminster in London... but a little more modest. Usually called Capel Street Bridge it is formally named for the Irish Parliamentarian Charles Grattan Across the Liffey One of the many bridges that cross the Liffey. It joins Capel Street to Parliament Street on the South quays. It has been remodeled several times. Very good views. Would recommend to visit during the Golden Hour / Sunset, if the weather is good enough ! Canal well look after, clean for eyes Picturesque place. Different temperature,different feeling. You can see a nice view and sit  But be careful birds A cool promenade along the river with seahorse statuette signature of this bridge. Nice bridge and nice view by night :) Fantastic bridge, really well put together. At the very first sight it looked just like an ordinary bridge But make no mistake, Grattan Bridge is built out of the strongest materials, has an amazing design and provides people with a very secured solution to cross the river from in side to the other. I never felt more safe in my life. Highly recommended it, unlike the other bridges, this one does the job with pride. Sunny, rain or snow, the bridge is more than happy to help people cross from A to B, or the other way around. A bridge to cross the river. With benches and a fantastic view of Dublin at night. Handy spot to grab a taxi home. Beautiful. I visited from NY. I love how each bridge was unique Its a good bridge. It didnt break while I walked on it which is pretty nice because I cant swim. If it had broken Id have given it 4 stars unless I drowned then I wouldnt have been able to rate it. Just in case I drown next time I rate it 1 star. I visited this bridge as my bother lost his life trying to save another person on easter saturday when he jumped from this bridge to do a heroic act. Thats one of the prettiest bridges here and its very good to sit and enjoy seeing the river, that nice Bridge and specially the sunset. Fabulous place to sit and people watch... beautiful bridge and view along the river... Grattan Bridge (Irish: Droichead Grattan) is a road bridge spanning the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland, and joining Capel Street to Parliament Street and the south quays. The first bridge on this site was built by Sir Humphrey Jervis in 1676. It was named as Essex Bridge to honour Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It joined several of Jervis developments (including Capel Street and Jervis Street) to the opposite side of the river and to Dublin Castle. Essex Bridge was an arched stone structure with 7 piers, and apparently partly constructed from the ruined masonry of nearby St. Mary s Abbey on the northside. In 1687 the bridge was damaged by a flood resulting in the loss of a hackney and two horses. The damage to the bridge was only partially repaired. In 1751 the second most northerly pier collapsed and damaged the adjacent arches. Between 1753 and 1755 the bridge was rebuilt by George Semple, to correct flood and other structural damage and as one of the first initiatives of the Wide Streets Commission. During this construction, some original features were removed, including the Equestrian Statue Of George I, by John van Nost the Elder, which was moved in 1798 to the gardens of the Mansion House. In 1937 it was bought by the Barber Institute for Fine Arts in Birmingham, in front of which it now stands. For much of the 18th century, Essex Bridge was the most westerly bridge on the Liffey. From 1872, the bridge was further remodelled (on Westminster Bridge in London), being widened and flattened with cast iron supports extended out from the stonework so as to carry pavements on either side of the roadway. The bridge was (and is still) lit by ornate lamp standards also in cast iron. The bridge was reopened as Grattan Bridge in 1874, being named after Henry Grattan MP (1746-1820). From 2002, Dublin City Council undertook a reconstruction of the bridge deck,[8] with granite paving for the footpaths and a set of benches with wooden seats and toughened glass backs. As part of what was intended to be a European-style book market, in 2004 several temporary kiosks (prefabricated in Spain) were also controversially built on the bridge. Originally intended to create a contemporary version of an inhabited bridge, such as the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, these kiosks were later removed. As is tradition among Dubliners, the name used locally for the bridge will vary from Capel Street Bridge, to Grattan Bridge and the original Essex Bridge. I guess its pretty good, for a bridge. Stops cars and pedestrians from falling into the Liffey while going from 1 side to the other. Quite similar to OConnell bridge that way Yes, well the price is nice and the fashion its comercial innthe woman area you can found many style and very good options , the man not really , unfortunally penneys man area its  bored the style its urban and casual not good desing in compare to other retails shop. And some staff in casher its rude and unpolige with the customer . I know its busy shop but the bad behaivor make feel poor and bad experience in the shopping . Maybe te manager need trainer all this staff in good friendly and  manner in the service customer. Sorry but really i hope so they can be better next time. 50 years more all depends in this things qualities services and good fashion desing for women and men. Despite a lot of competition, if you need to cross a river, this bridge is the place to go. Across it. Not five stars because dont want to encourage complacency Its a nice place to Sit and enjoy the sight of liffey river One more bridge in Dublin. There is nothing special about it. It has a nice view. And it is very busy. But nothing special. Pretty dirty to tell the truth Nice bridge to people watch and to chill a bit when the sun is getting low in the afternoon."
84,Green Bench Cafe,4.775,"Coming here for years. Even out of the country for 6 of them and its still as good as ever. Pop in for beef brisket once a month. The thing weighs a kg and fills me for the day. Some of the best lunch options in the area. Not cheap but worth the price. Really flavourful, small menu and quick despite the queues Vegetarian options: Blackbeen or falafel options, and sometimes soup or stew. I m honestly not a big sandwich person, much less a wrap person, but OH MY GOD this ish was delicious. Super generous fillings, fresh ingredients, perfect proportions, and flavor pairings spot on - all for a reasonable price (I can see why trips here would become a lunch break ritual). The staff were super friendly to boot. My only suggestion would be to label more clearly what kind of bread/wrap each sandwich comes on. If I could change one thing it would be to go back and ask for bread instead of a wrap, but it was delicious and the swap might ve messed with the finished product, so no complaints. Perfect spot for sandwiches. We tried all of them and every single one tastes amazing. Definatly a must go for every sandwich lover! This place makes the best value and amazing sandwiches in town, every time I have eaten from here each bit is a festival of texture and flavour unlike any other. Cannot recommend more We stopped by to get a quick coffee and a sandwich. We went for the halloumi and avacado breakfast sandwich and to put it simple, it was AMAZING. Will definitely be back again. Highly recommend! The chef knows what the good food means ! Reasonable price , nice staffs Food This place is one of the best sandwiches in Dublin, staff are extremely friendly and efficient. The soup is always amazing here, there really is no fault with this place, not to mention the price which is very reasonable. A real hidden gem! Delicious sandwiches! Highly recommended for any sandwich lovers out there !! A leading light in Dublins sandwich game. Always fresh. Always delicious. No matter which sandwich you choose. And for the amount you get, you wont feel short changed. And the service is always amazing. Make sure to get there early (12.30) to beat the lunch rush! Amazing spot for a take-away lunch.  Im working my way through the menu and everything has been great so far, regardless of whether its in bread or a wrap.  Wait times can be a bit long (~20 mins) if you hit it at peak time, but worth the wait.  Or just get there a bit early.  Either way, just try it! I had Such a delicious and well made sandwich today Thanks green benchers Food Most delicious sandwiches in Dublin, really good prices, a must try. Beware of long queues, but they move fast. By far the best place in Dublin for a sandwich. Ive been to other cafes and sandwich spots around the city but none has topped Green Bench. The sandwiches are easily the nicest, plus the portions are always great. The soup is delicious also. Its by far the best value for a sandwich and soup combo in Dublin also, there are other spots that charge way more for a lesser sandwich and smaller soup. Finally, Suzanne and the staff are incredibly nice and good craic. You will not be disappointed going here. As a local, Id say if youre in Dublin for a few days, this is a must spot to visit. Five stars each time I go. Vegetarian options: Definitely the best veggie sandwich Ive ever had - the black bean and sweet potato burger sandwich is incredible. Great service, the staff member realised I didn t really want a cold breakfast and offered yummy hot porridge, with strawberry and yoghurt and it was so yummy. I also tried their banana bread and it was devine! Holy CRUP Ive been going here for years! Where to start? Best coffee in Dublin. Its highly unusual to say that but it endures. Its very much not just down to the Upside beans theyve been using for years, its not just the machines they use, its far more about precision and technique. Their breakfast sandwiches and sausage rolls (Fridays) are second to none. The queue speaks for itself. Always fresh, always made on-prem, right down to the relish used in the breakfast sandwich. I learned how to cook their scrambled eggs by watching them so now I can enjoy them at home. Cant praise their food enough. Kudos. Famously savage sandwiches. Pick your time wisely or prepare to queue. Food Fantastic little gem in the heart of Dublin. There is a queue at lunchtime every day but its worth the wait. OMG, they know how to make a sandwich, this is the best place for a sandwich in Dublin, worth Queing up for it I had the chicken sandwich and it was very tasty. Much tastier than I expected from this unassuming shop. Lovely sausage roll but at that price I would want someone feeding it to me. Up from  2.50 to  4 in last two years. Amazing BBQ pork with asian slaw sandwiches, well worth the wait The very best sandwich ever. And the sausage rolls on Friday are unbelievable!! Great sandwiches, the queue any day of the week lets you know that youve stumbled on to something very good. Sandwiches and salads are of a very high standard and they also have a small range of baked goods which are also very tasty. The staff are really nice and patient considering the volumes of people they are dealing with at lunchtime, I would definitely not be able for it! One of the best sandwiches in Dublin. You should order there. The staff are friendly. Tasty & Perfect For A Picnic. Green Bench Cafe is a takeaway that offers the best sandwiches, so it s nice to grab your sandwich and eat it in St Stephen s Green Park. This is the best place for sandwiches in Dublin, and the girl behind the counter is always so nice. I always make a point to go here when I have a day off Simply great place for lunch. Its great quality at a fair price. Only had the chicken so far, as its so good I keep wanting it again and again... Side salads that come with the sambo are very nicely presented too. The queue is always massive so best to go at 12 or 1.30. Staff are friendly and seem really into being there. Really want to try everything else on the menu, so will be back again soon. Best sandwiches Ive ever had! Really tasty, interesting ingredients and very generous portions. Friendly and very efficient staff. Dont be put off by the long queues, they move so quickly. Hidden gem! Probably one of the tastiest sandwiches Ive had in Dublin. Not many options, but each one as nice as eachother. Really friendly staff, get down early as it gets busy! Probably the best sandwiches Ive had. I passed a few times before but thought the queues were too long. I gave it a go the other day and they flew through the queue. I think Ive found my new regular lunch spot.... Small and busy take away, efficiently run but due to its popularity there can be queues. Coffee comes in pain packaging white and there is a small selection of lovely sweets. The sausage rolls are great, unlike any Ive had in Dublin so far and the conversation in the queue always reverts to this topic. Unfortunately I didnt get a picture, but my wife and I had delicious sandwiches here. We arrived right at noon and experienced no line for lunch. If we had any more time in Dublin, we would certainly be returning. I would suggest getting drinks and walking to St. Stephens for a great atmosphere while eating, though the pigeons will be eyeing your food. Prices in line with other major competitors. Sandwiches are okay, nothing special, but portions are large. Disappointed by chicken and beef brisket options, while pulled pork is rather good. Soups are very nice. For better tasting sandwiches I suggest Emers Kitchen (beef or lamb) or Gerards (pulled pork), but  they dont come with lots of veggies. The queues dont lie, the Green Bench delivers probably the best value lunch in Dublin and its great quality too. The sandwiches are fantastic, freshly prepared in front of you and the brownies and carrot cake are lovely. My favourite under  10 lunch place in Dublin. Delicious sambos and treats (esp the banana bread). Sandwiches are well stuffed with fillings and the ingredients all compliment each other perfectly...havent had a bad sandwich there in ca. 2 years of visits! Delicious sandwiches - they really hit the spot. Can get very busy sometimes. They have a good social media presence which is handy for keeping up-to-date with the daily menus. 4 stars as there is nowhere on the premises to sit down (although when the weathers ok Stephens Green or The Iveagh Gardens are nice places to enjoy the food) and it is a bit on the expensive side. This is one of the very famous sandwich cafes in Dublin, specially for a casual lunch. It is really busy for lunch during weekdays but they have a great fast pace service. There menu usually contains 5 sandwiches, from chicken, beef, pork, ham or turkey and some vegetarian options, but the fillings changes daily. Also you can get them on white, brown bread or wraps. It is a definite recommended place and you will be better going earlier than 12:00 for lunch. It is only a take away restaurant, but there is Stephens green park close by if the weather allows for sitting out. Ive only had the doughnuts and sausage rolls so far... wont be beaten. Incredible chefs, made fresh on site every morning. I work around the corner from here. Its loved by my colleagues but to me the sandwiches always taste cheap and poor quality. Service is abysmal. They never smile and if its two minutes before lunchtime, they wont serve you a lunchtime sandwich, even if you can see theyre already made. Totally inflexible. I  prefer The Fat Fox and Emers Kitchen."

86,Groundstate Coffee,4.775,"Food:as for the new item on the menu based on the recommendation from the staff. Was a great idea but did not work with this bread, nor the amount of proportion made through the density of the toast, the decorations of pesto were ideally great but were too oily to work with and it made the bottom of the type of bread soggy on the bottom half of the plate. Which was very moist to handle, toast should be eaten with joy, not with mess. Had to use a fork to scrap the falling chunks of ingredients due to the over amount in the bread. Gin idea is great and realistic need to work on the plating proportions and ingredients combo. Service : for the hours of arrival space available were going Okay. Not too busy so waiting time not too bad, as for the recommendation as referred on the food can be implemented better option. But they were trying their best. Were very nice and considerate and serve was fast at the till. Atmosphere : Seating areas a very limited for table options whether too big of a table for a family of 10 or a near a window with a baby size seat not suitable for everyone. Chairs need to be replaced  or  accomadate better seating strategy on the floor plan in the place. It is a very busy breakfast place, but people change quickly, so there is no problem with waiting for a table. The service staff is extensive, so everything happens very quickly. The dishes are very fulfilling, tasty and large, so one from the menu is enough. The pastel de nata is tasty, but not the best Ive ever eaten. The staff was extremely friendly and the order came in just a few minutes. Overall a very good culinary experience, we tried the Brekki bun and the pulled pork burger. 10 / 10 experience Food Great spot for lunch !! Friendly and welcoming staff 3 unique and creative vegan options. The Tofu sandwich was perfect. Its massive, full of flavour and fresh ingredients. Coffee was also perfect. Everything is very reasonably proved for the quality and service. Its my new favourite place in the city 100% recommend Vegetarian options: 2 vegan sandwiches Vegan scramble We recently came across this cafe by chance as we had a booking at the Guiness store house. The food and coffee were incredible, we shared a toasted sandwich and it was delicious. Not only that but the staff were super friendly and when we mentioned our Guiness factory booking time they got our food to us in less than 15mins so we had enough time to get there! We visited this place for a quick bite before heading to Guinness Storehouse and they didn t disappoint. The menu has good options including vegan and vegetarian options. There is also a selection of teas and coffees.  The staff are always smiling which is very nice. The food is tasty and filling. The place is a bit small and the seating is not comfortable but the food compensates for that. We didn t try the dessert but they looked good. Great place for a breakfast.  Right next to the Guinness Storehouse.  The coffee was one of the best we had in Dublin and the food was pretty good This is my third time here, this cafe is a great place for breakfast and lunch. Great staff. Good flat white coffee cappuccino. Good food. The place is cozy. My wife and I will be back in the is next time We went there for lunch, great food and coffee for a good price. Order is at the till but you are served at the table. Service was fast despite a busy time! Great, fresh coffee. Artisan bread for the sandwiches. Lots of fresh options for everyone - carnivores to vegans. I had an amazing toasted sandwich with Brie and mushrooms sauteed in tamari. Super friendly people and great location near Pearse Lyons Distillery and Guinness. We were here for the late brunch on a Monday afternoon. Had the tofu scramble dish which was quite good. The tofu was flavourful and the sauteed greens on top were an excellent side. The fried halloumi side was good as well. The coffee was great and so was the vegan coconut chocolate coconut ball. The service for the most part was good, but there was one member of staff with a green cap who was giving us stern looks and behaving unruly.  A married couple friend of ours were having their food by the window facing the street, she put her hand between them without any warning to collect something menu from the table. Apart from her, the rest of the staff were friendly and courteous. We also appreciate the cafe for taking our order even 30 mins before close on a bank holiday and serving up delicious food and coffee! Had the best toastie of my LIFE here last Saturday. Gluten free as well! It is always packed on the weekends, and for good reason. Amazing staff, everyone is so friendly and welcoming! Dietary restrictions: Good gluten free bread options for the sandwiches! I recently had the pleasure of visiting Groundstate, and I must say, it was an experience worth sharing. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the warm ambiance and the inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee. However, what truly stood out during my visit was the exceptional service provided by Manager Ludmila. Her attention to detail and dedication to ensuring every customers satisfaction was evident throughout my entire visit. Not only did Ludmila greet each customer with a genuine smile, but she also took the time to engage with them, making everyone feel welcome and valued. Her knowledge of the menu was impressive, and she was more than happy to provide recommendations based on my preferences. Furthermore, Ludmilas leadership skills were apparent in the way she effortlessly coordinated the team, ensuring that orders were taken promptly and efficiently. Despite the busy atmosphere, she remained composed and approachable, handling any issues with grace and professionalism. In addition to the exceptional service, the quality of the coffee   exceeded my expectations. Each sip of my latte was rich and perfectly balanced, and the cheesy mushroom toastie with its perfectly toasted bread and generous filling of savory mushrooms and gooey cheese, this sandwich is a delightful treat for your taste buds. Overall, my experience at Groundstate was nothing short of fantastic, thanks in large part to Manager Ludmila. Her commitment to excellence and passion for hospitality truly set this coffee shop apart. I will certainly be returning soon and recommending it to all of my friends. There is a big problem, bigggggg with micromanaging with a Brazilian girl that was doing the coffee that uses glasses. The guy taking orders using a red team shirt was excellent, great customer service, very shinny person, great personality. The girl instead of doing the coffees was starting at me from head to toe,bossing around the waitress, cutting off this guy taking orders, literally pushing him with her hands for him to take orders like taping in the shoulder. He was very uncomfortable with that and removing his sparkle. Another bad thing is the size of the coffee the large is not large its a regular cup, the small cup is for the flat white. I am sure customers notice that and that does not bring good image of the company. I work 20 years with hospitality, in many different places. I noticed other posts about the rotation of staff. This girl might be your problem. Everybody in a company should be treated in the same way. This micromanaging it is costing you good staff. Be aware of that, is such a small space people can sense that. Honestly , the best brunch I ever had In my life. I had the tofu sweet potato sandwhich with basil pesto and my boyfriend had the spicy tofu scrambled eggs. Coffee is also very good , they have coldbrew, flat white, filter origin coffee. Just amazing! Vegetarian options: A good variety of vegetarian option with tofu as well and roasted vegetables Ordered the Sambo Tofu and it was so so good!! Great flavours and the tofu was the perfect texture. Also loved the roast potatoes 10/10 recommend Absolutely would recommend. The staff are great, pleasant and welcoming. Food arrived super fast, which is great for lunch time. Had the pastrami sandwich. Portion size was decent. Food was tasty. I ordered a side of potato s. They should probably consider putting a dip/mayo as standard with them. But absolutely will be back. Hands down one of the best breakfasts of my life. Have never eaten so well before. Easily recommended to anybody looking for good food, nice place, great location! Popped in here to grab a quick breakfast before going to the Guinness Storehouse, and they delivered! Got a yummy vegan toastie and an iced latte. Not too overpriced and a decent amount of food! The employees were very kind and welcoming, and they brought out our food very fast! Nice atmosphere staff, good customer service, everybody attentive despite being busy. Food was also good, good quality coffee and I had a pastrami sambo which was fresh, well balanced, the pesto for decoration pairs really well with the last bits of bread on your plate. However, I felt that the non-toasted bread overpowers the pastrami s flavour. Could be a way better with a toasted bread. Overall, nice place. Would go back. Pas. Watch out the bathroom folks. The cafe is situated in a nice location bot too busy. There is near by parking available. The food was delicious. Different choices depending on your dietary restrictions. Good space to eat and have conversations. We have an omelette with toast, kale and vegan sausage. With some tofu scrambled with Siracha and white potatoes. Really good options and different! Very fulfilling food, amazing atmosphere and great service. 10 out of 10. Keep up with the good job folks! We popped in on Sunday for a lovely brunch. The french toast was the best we have ever had. The pulled pork sandwich was amazing too. Finished off with a finely selected ground black coffee and a chai latte. Will definitely be back to try out the mushroom cheese toastie! Love coming here when I want something different for breakfast. The Dahl is very good and filling! My digestion loves it too lol One star lost for how overly warm it is inside otherwise place is great, best overnight oats going. Egg dishes are lovely if a but overpriced (2 people, 2 egg dishes, 2 coffees, one lemonade circa  43) and the coffee is great! Would come back Very good! We came across this little restaurant by chance while walking around Dublin and we were not disappointed! Quality products, hearty yet healthy dishes, attentive staff, all in a setting with a quirky atmosphere which gives it all its charm. It just goes to show that chance does things well! If we come back to Dublin we will definitely come back. Kisses from France (Marseille) Amazing vegan sambo! This cafe is the perfect spot for people watching out of the window. We had coffees and food and soaked up the great tunes and views. Fab brunch! My favorite place in Dublin!! It s always a fantastic experience to come to Groundstate with such good vibes, excellent service, and delicious plates. What a GREAT coffee experience in Dublin! Expert and kind staff, Coffee beans are selected and the food Uow! This could be nominated for the Rock n  Roll of fame Thank you and congrats, Luiz (barista) for the service. Definitely a place to go when in Dublin. Pastrami sambo and croissant are nice! An aesthetic coffee shop! Lovely place - pastrami sambo was so tasty. Coffee was delicious too This has to be the best cafe in the liberties/Dublin. Love the vibe, great coffee, great food, super friendly staff.. highly recommend Amazing specialty coffee and excellent service, staff is constantly checking on customers to make sure they have everything they need. We were there for a brunch and had mushroom toasties as well, they are unbelievably tasty. Would definitely recommend. Came for early impromptu brunch and this place did not disappoint. Staff were attentive and helpful. Amazing balance of meat and vegan options so both of us had choice! I had the vegan sambo with marinated mushrooms, vegan ricotta and kimchi on sourdough and its probably the best vegan breakfast sandwich Ive had! Sides of roast potatoes were generous and deliciously seasoned. And my partner had the new spicy chorizo eggs with homemade chilli relish which Ive been told was sensational, which encompassed creamy scrambled eggs and rich speciality chorizo sausage. The coffee was also delicious. Wish we had room to take some home on our flight! Really nice little coffee shop! Very raw inside with nice baristas/waiters too! The coffee (filter) was very good and the granola bowl was also delicious! Enough to wake up on the right foot. Thank you and see you next time! Vegetarian options: Some dishes adapted to the vegetarian diet and adaptable dish. Dietary restrictions: Possibility of changing ingredients and adapting it. Wheelchair accessibility: Windowside coffee table adapted to the armchair. I got eggs, halloumi and kale which seemed like it lacked something to out it over the edge, maybe mushrooms of some sort? I liked it but it seemed a bit safe for that price. Their filter coffee was nice. I went solo for breakfast and even in the rain there was a queue out the door. The popularity of the place made it feel like a place you couldnt really linger and relax. Id like to try another thing on their menu and buy some beans next time. Definitely a hidden gem around Dublin, food was great, superb coffee and the service was amazing, very friendly staff. One of the best coffees I ve ever had. Great for the breakfast and lunch. Pastrami Sambo is fully loaded with meat, highly recommended. Lovely place!! Amazing vegan toast, french toast and delicious coffee!! All the staff were great too!! I ll definitely come back and recommend to everyone. Really nice food. I had the overnight oats and a croissant which both were lovely. Service was great too. Its a bit small so risk of not getting a table."
87,Guinness Storehouse,4.75,"Today marked my third visit to this prestigious venue, eager to immerse myself once again in the world of Guinness beer. What continues to captivate me is the mesmerizing cascade of bubbles that dance down the glass as the beer settles. Its a sight that never fails to intrigue and delight. Despite not being a beer enthusiast originally, Guinness has completely won me over with its rich flavors and smooth texture. Its no wonder why Irish people hold it in such high regard. Each visit deepens my appreciation for this iconic brew and the craft behind it. The Guinness Storehouse in Dublin is a must-visit. This historic seven-story building offers an immersive experience into the world of Guinness, covering its history, brewing process, and iconic advertising. Highlights include the hands-on Guinness Academy, where you learn to pour the perfect pint, and the Gravity Bar, offering stunning panoramic views of Dublin alongside a complimentary pint of Guinness. The exhibits are well-presented and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. Overall, its a captivating blend of culture, history, and interactive fun, making it a top attraction in Dublin. Highly recommended! Great experience and I ve done plenty of brewery tours (Budweiser, Coors, etc) and ever worked at Coors brewery.. this was by far the best family friendly experience tour I ve been on for major brands.  My non-beer drinking wife and mom loved it, and my 1yr old baby loved it based on her reactions throughout the self paced tour.  Stroller friendly, and you get to skip the entry line too with a stroller.  Experience is great, ends with a pint or soft drink, and the gift shop has everything you need to remember your time.  Golf peeps they have something for us in the shop. This was a great experience there is a lot to see and learn here. I did the guided tasting and it was worth every penny, we got to sample different types of Guinness and learn how to pour the perfect pint at the end of the tour. The gift shop was full of really interesting and unique items that made wonderful gifts. I would strongly recommend that you book your tour in advance spots in the guided tour go fast. At the end of the tour you get a voucher for a free pint of Guinness on the roof of the building, there are some people who don t drink Guinness so they may offer you the voucher for the free drink. The views from the top of the storehouse are amazing you can see a lot from there on a clear day. Interesting place to visit, obviously centred around Guinness fans. We did feel that the exhibits were somewhat padded out to try to fill the space. A whole area dedicated to the water used etc etc. Good views from the bar at the top, the advertising floor was quite interesting. In my opinion, unless you are a real fan of Guinness it is interesting but not a must visit. The most iconic tourist attraction in Dublin, I really did enjoy my visit, it was a self guided tour with some amazing views, dance and music show and history and we got to try a glass of the drink. It s a must visit. We had an amazing time. They were also horse carriage rides just right outside if you wanted to. Buy tickets for the self guided tour as they sell out fast. Easy to enter. Your was great. Lots of cool visuals and videos. Grab a pint on the top floor with a 360 view of Dublin. The Guinness storehouse is a must bucket list place to visit! We were totally blown away with all the details, information and visual artifacts on the tour! I was wondering what it was going to be in here? But was pleasantly surprised! So much to view and information to take in, it was kind of overwhelming and fascinating! I loved the visual waterfall that they produced  shapes of Guinness Glasses, The Irish Harp symbol, and their pure water in display, dropping from the ceiling. It was so quick and clear, but hard to get a good picture of it all. Also loved the wheat growing in the field section, the colour changes in use wheat and ceiling   beautiful! I was also fascinated with the information of how the Coopers made all the barrels, to hold all the Guinness made. As a Carpenter myself, had great respect for how hard this job would of been! All done by hand, shaping all this Oak, at great speeds, with only the eye of the tradesman, perfecting the pieces to make the barrels Information to how they made the Guinness finished product in visuals, was brilliant, learnt so much today. Then onto the taste testing room, where they done a presentation and we all had a tiny glass of Guinness Finally, up to the Gravity bar     where we had a free pint of the black stuff, a beautiful pint of Guinness each We managed to share a take and seats with a lovely group of Americans. We enjoyed our Guinness and the view of the Dublin City landscape, truly fantastic! Thank you to all at the Guinness factory. On the surface, seemed bit silly to pay  26 for a pint and be subjected to a marketing campaign. Well precisely because theyre such masters of marketing, they managed to provide couple of hours of entertainment via well thoughtout and engaging audio-visual displays. Perhaps Id have felt differently had I not been able to grab a seat to enjoyed that perfectly poured pint while soaking in the Dublin skyline from their Gravity Bar. The Guinness Storehouse is an absolute must-visit when in Dublin! From the moment you step inside, youre immersed in a world of history, brewing expertise, and sheer excitement. The experience is both educational and interactive, offering fascinating insights into the iconic Guinness brand and its rich heritage.One of the highlights is the small tasting of Guinness along the way, giving you a delightful sneak peek into the brewing process. And the grand finale? Enjoying a pint size at the end of the tour while taking in the breathtaking 360-degree view of Dublin from the Gravity Bar.The Guinness Storehouse offers an unforgettable experience for visitors of all ages and interests. Whether youre a beer aficionado or simply looking for a unique way to explore Dublin, this attraction delivers on every level. Make sure to add it to your itinerary   you wont be disappointed! On our first trip to Dublin we wanted to include a visit to the original home of Guinness. We booked on-line and were soon waiting in a short queue to enter the premises. We were a little apprehensive given the many tour buses and horse drawn carriages waiting just outside. Anyway we were lead to the main shop area where we were given a short explanation of the way forward. We had chosen to take the self guided tour and so started to walk slowly up and around the 7 floors of this iconic building. There are many interactive exhibits describing how Guinness is made and then marketed throughout the ages. The film in one of the rooms wasnt that interesting to be honest. There included a short tasting in mini glasses before we finally climbed up to the large and busy Gravity Bar at the top of the building. Here you have 360deg views over the city whilst you enjoy the famous pint (or two). On the day we were there, it was late afternoon and very full - difficult to find anywhere to sit down and enjoy the atmosphere and views. But never mind. All good! Absolute MUST DO for any visitor to Dublin! What a fantastic experience! We bought our tickets in advance but arrived early and were allowed in which was really great since it began to rain. Tickets also can be purchased at the door if you wish to go spur of the moment. Never felt rushed, took us about 2.5 hours including the pint up top in the bar. Incredibly put together, fun experience to tell the history and brewing process. The advertising section was fun with lots of photo ops. We paid extra to get our selfie lasted into the foam of our first pint..super fun to see! The section we got to have a taster with the guides was really informative...learning what to smell and taste in each pint. Definitely a highlight of our Dublin trip! If you want to experience the Mecca of brew tour experience, this is the place. The folks here take it to the next level, it s like Disneyland on drugs. It s great if you want to learn more about the history of Guinness but in a very interactive way. Is it worth a visit if you love beer? Yeah, I think so. They have clearly put a lot of time and money into the experience and its pretty cool walking through all the areas and exhibits, especially the more immersive ones, like learning how to properly drink a Guinness. Also, if you want some merch, the shop is pretty impressive, even if youre just looking around. It was pretty crowded, especially in the gravity bar, so if you have the ability to go during an off peak time (if there are any), that would be your best bet. A great experience where you learn, breath, taste and drink Guinness. There is also an amazing gift shop with decent prices and an amazing view of Dublin city waiting at the top. Definitely recommend. Learning the history and the process of making Guinness, the viral ad campaigns and how Guinness holding the copyright for the original harp made the Irish government use a mirror image of the harp as the national emblem was amazing. You get to choose from one of 6 Guinness types as your drink. The gift shop has tons of clothing, chocolates, toffees, collectibles, magnets and more. They also have a cafe inside. Price is variable depending on time (peak times and holidays higher) averaging usually around  30. This was one of the best experiences we had in Dublin! The history of this brewery is incredible and you feel it as you walk through the place. The beer is outstanding!  We did the connoisseur tour and it was well worth the money! Our guide was knowledgeable, friendly, and fun! Great experience!!! Interesting and fun, you can lear about all Guinness manufacturing process, and drink a few pint s! I do recommend, even they have a interactive musical show. Always you need buy the tickets by advance This is a fascinating, multi-floor immersive experience. It s incredible that Guinness has managed to create such a big experience dedicated to a beer   it feels more like an amusement park. You ll learn about the history of the beer and brand and everything that goes into making a pint. However, the crowds are insane and make it nearly impossible to enjoy. Every room is slammed with people clustering around small screens and information boards trying to watch or read. If you don t like crowds, this will not be an enjoyable experience for you, and it s unfortunate that Guinness doesn t do more to limit the number of people. Absolutely fantastic, must see attraction with a mesmerising self guided tour that includes a tasting session and a free pint in the gravity bar that has the best views of Dublin. The tour was not a drag and gave you everything you want to learn and at  6.30 some of the cheapest beers in the city. This is a must see! I visited the Guinness Storehouse again after 9 years and I can say that I was very positively surprised. The visit became more interactive and exciting. We are welcomed by a guide who explains the floors of the building and we are immediately curious to know everything. The explanation of the creation process is very good and immersive, the testing is very interesting and there are several extra activities that we can do. The ticket price perfectly justifies the experience. The store is huge and very complete, but I would say that the highlight of the visit is the pint at the bar, which has a view that leaves us speechless. An unmissable and fabulous visit! The Guinness Storehouse is an incredible experience! The tour was fascinating, the views from the Gravity Bar were stunning, and the pint of Guinness was perfect. Highly recommend visiting! A must-visit place in Dublin! Everything is so well thought out. You can also learn a lot from a walk without a guide. Beautiful, fun, and very colorful. Definitely, the bar with the panoramic view of the city is the perfect way to end the walk. The service and overall attitude of the people working there are amazing. I advise and recommend going there for sunset. The experience is amazing! Five stars are not enough. One of the best and fun breweries I ve been too so far in both Europa and North America. Lots to see and do and a lot of fun. Take a journey on this self guided tour, learn the history from making the casks (barrels) to the Guinness family history, to obviously the process of the hops, barley, waterfall water (90%), and yeast combined to make one of the greatest beers in the world     . Enjoy the taste tester tour within the brewery. Explore the 6 floors of the and finish off with a pint of any Guinness of your choice. Learn how to properly drink and pour the beer as well  a lot of interactive stations. It is family friendly but under 18 years and you can t drink as per the law of Ireland    . Cheers to beers Visiting the Guiness Storehouse was overall quite a good experience, eventhough I thought it would be more like a trip to Charlies Chocolate factory but for Guinness ... with beer fountains in the lobby, a beer lake where you can drink as much as you like and Oompa-Loompas singing Irish songs and playing the harp. This is the reality: You are welcomed by an employee who gives a small introductory speech. From then on you can explore the museum on your own. The whole building should in theory resemble a huge pint, but I couldnt really see it. Normally you go to an area first, where the producing process is explained and where the ingredients come from. There is one bar where you can get your free guiness which is included in your normal ticket. There is also another bar where you can get a pint with your face on top of the foam for some extra money. In the tasting area you get an extra shot of Guinness and an employee explains how the drinking is correctly done. In a small cinema you can watch old Guinness advertisments. But the highlight for me was definitly the roof bar where you have a wonderful 360deg view over Dublin. However, it was really crowded up there, so consider yourself lucky if you can get a seat. I paid 26 Euro for a normal student ticket. The giftshop has horrendous prices so I didnt buy anything there. Me and a friend spend in total about 2 hours there. If you have never been at this museum before, you can not even imagine what you will see there. Thats what happened with us. We didnt look at photos and videos before the visit. We just came to see the museum of the well-known beer brand. What you saw is impressive with its creativity, organization of space, and curiosities on each floor. It is much better to see it than to read about it a lot. Tickets could be bought ONLINE ONLY. There is free of charge parking lot for visitors This place is awesome. From learning how Guinness is made to different entertainment such as live music and Irish dancing in almost every floor. And of course - a pint of Guinness at the rooftop bar! Visited on I visited for the first time in almost ten years and its just as good as I remember. We did the full experience with the Guiness Academy and would recommend it. Its a little more expensive but having in mind how much a pint costs un Dublin in general its worth it fir the experience. The majority of the museum highlights had been upgraded and with better technology since my last visit, so  you can see that they invest in the experience and keep it up to date. Lovely staff, shout out to Elise at the Guinness Academy! The basic tour gets three stars  we upgraded to the connoisseur experience and that took it to up to 5 stars for me. You get to try an ipa (type of beer varies according to season) and three versions of guineas, plus  you get to pour your own pint of Guinness that you can enjoy waking around, and you still have three free beer at the top bar that comes with the basic tour. So, two full pints, and four half pints, plus a nice and intimate experience in a private room. Loved it. Highly recommended This is an absolutely necessary experience when you are visiting Dublin. Be sure to buy your tickets in advance online, because the time slots frequently sell out. It can be a very busy place because it is so popular! The experience is 6 floors of displays and interesting videos, etc, based on the history of the Guinness brand, the brewing of the beer, and how they package and market it. The basic tour ticket includes a pint of beer on the upper level at the end of your tour, and a Guinness tasting on the 4th floor. If you want to learn to pour a pint, there is an extra fee of 12 Euros. Plan on spending an hour to 90 minutes here. Went over to Dublin for the weekend. Had a great time touring the Guiness storehouse. Make sure you buy tickets in advance as your not guaranteed to to buy on the day. Well worth it especially having a Guiness in the Gravity Bar where you have a 360 view around Dublin. You are in Ireland, so you should add this place to your list of places to visit. You don t necessarily need a guide, you can do a self guided tour. You get to experience everything in beer making process and it is visually and sensory stimulating. My favourite part was the aroma isolation room. Staff are helpful and kind. I personally do not like beer but I am open to experience and stepping out of my comfort zone. I did try the beer in small portion, it did taste great, buttery and perfect temperature.  You ca get a tasting samples for a fee. There is a restaurant there, and a snack bar. I m a foodie and I love trying different foods. I liked the Guinness kettle chips, the Guinness chocolate mousse, I was told that they serve a very good Irish stew here, so I had to try it, I loved it. It was saucy, thick and comforting. My all time favourite was, Guinness chocolate mousse. If you are a dessert lover don t skip on this. I recommend that you buy your tickets in advance for a better experience. Be sure to book in advance ! This is an excellent tour too while in Dublin. The self guided tour is really informative and flows well, if not a tad busy with so many people at times. The displays are very well done and laid out. The sky bar at the top gives a wild view of the whole city - Id do it again just for that. You can spend hours in this enormous place. We were there for more than 3 hours. The tour is self-guided and there are different tour options to choose from. You will leave here having new knowledge and admiration for how much is involved in the making of a pint of Guinness. Theres the history of the brewery, facts about the making of the beer, marketing throughout the years, innovations that are being explored. You can have your face printed on the foam head. You get a free pint of your choice (a 0.0 alcohol available as well) at the skyview bar with a magnificent 360 degree view of Dublin for as far as the eye can see. Huge gift shop also. Had the pleasure of visiting after the holidays. Lovely place with seven floors of history and information. Sadly, it is self guided, and because of the large number of visitors, its a bit chaotic. But it had a nice Cafe on one of the floors with beautiful pastries. The restrooms were small and wait time was about 5-10 minutes. They offered other experiences like a printed picture on a pint but were not available to everyone due to how busy it was. Once you got to level 7, the gravity room was packed, and there was very little standing room to enjoy your pint of Guinness. The shop had a huge selection of gifts and souvenirs at a decent price. Out of all the tours, this was my least favorite, but it was a nice e experience. If you love Guinness, then you will love this experience. If you are not a fan, it may turn you into one. The Guinness is amazing as expected and the staff were very friendly. The experience ran very smoothly and had a good atmosphere. While the museum part of the experience is good, the main highlights are the tasting and free Guinness at the end. I would recommend enjoying your free Guinness in one of the bars on the lower floors as the gravity bar is very busy and the view isn t that spectacular. Would recommend for stout and beer lovers. Slainte and Self-Discovery at the Guinness Storehouse! Just had a fantastic experience at the Guinness Storehouse today! The self-guided tour was the perfect mix of informative exhibits and interactive displays, taking me through the rich history and brewing process of this iconic Irish beer. Learning about Arthur Guinnesss vision and the meticulous steps involved in crafting the perfect pint was fascinating. Plus, who can resist the opportunity to pour your own (almost) perfect pint at the end? Lets just say the surge and settle is harder than it looks! But beyond the beer itself, the highlight was the stunning panoramic view of Dublin from the Gravity Bar. Sipping a fresh Guinness while overlooking the city was the perfect way to end the tour. Heres what I loved: Self-guided tour: Freedom to explore at my own pace and focus on the aspects that interested me most. Interactive exhibits: Kept things engaging and fun, especially for visual learners like myself. knowledgeable staff: Ready to answer any questions and share their passion for Guinness. Breathtaking view: The Gravity Bar offered a truly unforgettable vista of Dublin. Overall, I highly recommend the Guinness Storehouse for anyone visiting Dublin. Its a great way to learn about Irish culture, experience the brewing process firsthand, and of course, enjoy a delicious pint (or two) with a view! Rating: 4 stars Whether you like beer or not, this place is a legendary place in the city! The course is very educational and does not overwhelm us with information! It lasts about 2 hours without rushing too much! A must see in Dublin. Book tickets online before hand and get your preferred time slot as this is a busy venue. The experience events and live bands were great fun.. Went for a birthday day out. We Found the whole experience informative from start to the end. We enjoyed the part about the Coopers. We found a tasting very good and enjoyed the pint at the top off the gravity bar. Would recommend to anybody, it has lifts for disability and the elderly and prams . A fantastic place to visit in Dublin. Enough information, and things to see, to make the self-guided tour interesting and worthwhile, but not so much that it becomes onerous. The drink pint of Guinness at the end was very welcome and the bar offered great views over the city."
88,Guud Day Upper O'Connell Street,4.125,"Friendly stuff, place is clean and the location is great in the heart of dublin, 1-3 min from spire. Frappe mocha tasted great. Went for coffee and smoothies for breakfast with my daughters and husband. Very friendly staff, the place is very clean and quiet. We heard coffee here is good. Came here for 2 capuchino with coconut milk. 2 coffee is added up to  8.50 with extra charge of coconut milk (she put down as Cream in the receipt) of  0.65 each which is an extra of  1.30. But they charged us  3.90. Both my friend and I mentioned to the waitress twice. The first time, she didn t accept that she overcharged us when I mentioned. Then my friend came to explain to her that she overcharged us  2.60 but she gave my friend some attitudes and just gave her  0.65 back and turned away. At this point, we didn t want to argue anymore with her. This is really unacceptable service. Everything looked good until I saw the prepackaged pastries being taken out of the bags. If the sausage roll was the first sausage roll I had ever had, I d not eat another one. Mushy and not much complexity of flavor. The flat white was not very good either. Better than Starbucks, but not much. The muffin was pretty good, but unless it s dry, it s hard to mess up a muffin. I bought a bag through the Too Good To Go App on 2nd April 2023. It was  4.99 and the contents were meant to be worth  15. It was my first and last time ever going to Guud Day Cafe. It included a breakfast bap, 2 small soups and a sausage roll. I opened the bag which contained the breakfast bap 5 minutes after leaving the cafe. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. The sausage was burnt in parts, the bacon was rock hard and rubbery and the bap itself was freezing cold and extremely soggy. I took a bite and could not chew the meat. The sausage roll was also not fresh enough and was hard to chew also.. the soups both looked fine but my appetite was ruined to be honest so I couldnt stomach any of it. It all had to go in the bin. It was certainly not too good to go it was food fit for the bin. The customer service was the most shocking part though. I emailed on 3rd April. They didnt reply , I rang the cafe numerous times no answer. I went into the cafe on the 11th April to discuss it and see what the cafe could do to resolve the issue. They were very dismissive. Eventually the supervisor said she would get the manager to sort a refund. Later that day the manager replied to the email that I sent on the 3rd and said they wont be issuing a refund and just gave me the prices of what those items would cost to buy if you were to go in and buy them fresh. Not even an apolpgy for the quality of the food or the fact it took 8 days to reply (and only because I went into the cafe in person to complain). Such a terrible experience I would advise people to avoid this place. Pictures included of what this cafe deem as suitable to sell. Great coffee, nice and relaxing atmosphere. Good to meet to have a chat with friends or studying and enjoying something sweet. Staff is young, organized and smiles often. Had a lovely cup of chai latte with a coffee shot. It was so good. And the staff was very nice and friendly. Love the ambience of the place. Flat White is awesome. Salmon bagel is awesome. Lots of salmon. Good prices for Ireland and Dublin. Thank you. I really love how the place is furnished, in a hipster and colorful way. The menu offers a wide choice of coffees and cakes, I even got to drink a quite good espresso macchiato that I thought I couldn t find in Dublin. The service was kind and nice. I strongly recommend the carrots and nuts muffin. Melbourne quality coffee at better prices! 10/10 soy latte and delicious pesto/tomato/mozzarella ciabatta for  9/AUD$15. Wifi available. Good atmosphere. Friendly staff. Recommend! Lovely airy place.  Real Scandinavian feel to it.  Cakes and snacks at breakfast was lovely.  Definetly recommended. Nice little coffee house in Upper OConnell Street. We had a coffee whilst waiting for the Aircoach which stops directly opposite the cafe. i ve just been for coming up to 3 hours, it s a lovely place to study, i only got 2 coffees and wasn t reprimanded for occupying the table all that time. prices are reasonable for dublin but be warned there s a 50c additional charge on alternative milks which can hike up the price quite a bit. i bought an oat flat white and an oat latte, both lovely. it isn t the best coffee i ve ever had, but it s still tasty and warm, still a pleasure to drink. wi-fi is available once you ve made your purchase, the code is on the receipt. nice bathroom too, key code needed but again, it s on the receipt. squid loyalty stamps can be collected here. Nice coffee but on the day I visited this place they were clearly understaffed. Long queues, mismatched orders, missing mugs for eat in. Lovely coffee, nice decor. Great place to watch the world go by. While staying at the attached Holiday Inn Express, I had coffee here twice. Both times were great experiences. They even offer a discount if you are staying at the hotel. My traveling buddies and I all agreed they have guuuuuuuuuud coffee! IF YOU WANT GUUD COFFEE GO HERE,All the staff at guud day are very kind and friendly I wanted to give a particular mention to Milo for his splendid coffee skills and hospitality it made my experience very relaxing and memorable. ALSO not to mention his punctuality with the coffees and the attention to detail was flawless!!! Thankyou Service was perfect. Unfortunately, coffee was not great, neither was pastry. Food Nice place to start your day, even if you spoiled your latte on the wobbly table   Staff reacted absolutely customer-friendly, living up to its promise to make it a *Guud*Day! Food : 4/5 Wish I had gotten the names of the 2 staff at the till today, but they made my day, very very friendly. Was there for not a minute collecting my order and it was an absolute pleasure. Not to mention the food is definitely value for money. It was my first time going in there and it will definitely not be my last. I am a latte lover and this place serves one of the best lattes in Dublin in my opinion. I also tried the croissants with ham and cheese. Really good choice. I went a couple of times and will keep going. The staff is cool got a vanilla flat white and it was cheap and tasty. very coffee. very vanilla. very froth. idk how coffee reviews work. it was good and Ill probably go again. i didnt get anything else but they have really tasty looking food and pastries too. also nice atmosphere and music. Vegetarian options: lots of vegan friendly choices Dietary restrictions: they had loads of alternative options with food and milk types Lovely spot, 5 staff behind counter yet still slow service & place was not busy. Chicken & pesto sandwich was 6.95, dry as a bone. Coffee was very good. My favourite coffee shop in dublin. The staff are always friendly, and today especially after an incident with another customer, the staff checked on me, had the man leave, and then checked on me again. Also reasonably priced for Dublin! This was not Guud this was in fact baad. 15 minutes for a code with only 4 people ahead of me. Completely rude barista(if that s what you call her). Worst attitude I ve seen in a long time. To compound things further she gave me the wrong coffee and went about her business. Unfortunately I have allergies so dumped in the bin and went to Butlees. Try new things they say. Won t be back The staff made great coffee and are so lovely. Please check it out because u wont be disappointed. So good to workers at Pride We had a ham and cheese sandwich, a coffee and an apple juice. It tasted very good. Thanks to Sara for the really nice service. Stopped to grab an almond milk latte, cappuccino and a slice of lemon cake. There is a good selection of sandwiches to chose from including vegan. Great location on OConnell street, outdoor seating available. Vegetarian options: Vegetarian sandwiches available. They also offer non-dairy milk. Fantastic quality of coffee and cappuccino. Definitely would recommend this Cafe to anybody on the go! If there was more stars would give them! Quick, friendly  and efficient service! Very welcoming and friendly staff!  Lovely coffee, the best in Dublin. My barista Sodem was so dayummmmm   . All really cheerful! I d recommend this place 11/10 First very rude barista ask twice for said hello second  the service in a paper cup? after tell her Im drinking it insaid not takeaway very rude very very bad service that piercing girl  !!!! Very nice little cafe coffee shop, nice food and drink selection, the staff were very friendly, not too expensive either. Great place to stop for refreshments in the centre of town, has great connections with Luas (Trams), Buses and coaches. I ve come in a few times now to get coffee and everyone its great! Staff are so lovely! It s actually a nice place. For me as a german maybe a bit overpriced, but maybe that s just ma economic perspective. food is good but the employees don t know what a cheesecake is like wth????? It is an excellent place to have a moment for yourself or meet with your friends. Good prices & helpful staff. Great coffee . Nice service very helpful lady at counter . I couldnt buy from this shop, there were two people on the till and they werent welcoming and I was standing there for around 10 minutes and nobody took my order, I decided to go Fantastic coffee served with a smile also had a pastry which was very nice indeed I ordered a hot chocolate at Guud day and it was very good. It is very close to the living room pub. Great customer service , always positive and full of energy, thank you Vianna and Sodem for Guud Day"
89,Ha'penny Bridge,4.375,"A historic icon that you should definitely stop to see while you re in Dublin! Walk across the bridge to access the Temple Bar area with all of its famous pubs! The bridge is lit up at night, so check it out after sunset, too. Cute little bridge to walk across from city center, lots of restaurants on both sides of bridge. Very touristy as one would expect It isn t the prettiest of bridges or backdrops, but this bridge is part of the core of Dublin. When you know, you know! #Dirty Owl Town Pedestrian bridge across the river, historical significance but nothing extraordinary as a tourist now. Near Temple Bar area so can pop out to see it. A lovely bridge and a great picture I managed to take this evening! The Hapenny Bridge (/ he pni/ HAYP-nee; Irish: Droichead na Leathphingine, or Droichead na Life), known later for a time as the Penny Hapenny Bridge, and officially the Liffey Bridge, is a pedestrian bridge built in May 1816 over the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland. Made of cast iron, the bridge was cast in Shropshire, England. a beautiful historic bridge in the centre of dublin. also had some great views of both sides of the city! The Hapenny Bridge is truly iconic   a symbol of Dublins charm and history. Crossing this picturesque bridge is like stepping into a postcard scene. Its elegant design and breathtaking views of the River Liffey make it a must-see landmark. A timeless gem that encapsulates the spirit of Dublin, offering a magical experience for locals and visitors alike. This bridge cuts across the centre of the city and is a great photo spot to showcase the city. Its free to cross and is surrounded by many other bridges. A lovely old pedestrian bridge that spans the river Liffey, linking Temple bath, with the north side. Definetly worth a visit and a venture to Henry street Beautiful bridge, and definitely worth visiting early in the morning for less people on it. We had it all to ourselves around 8 am on a Monday, the city was so quiet and it made for better pictures. The bridge itself isnt the prettiest, but it is iconic. A must visit if your in Dublin, the oldest pedestrian bridge to cross the river Liffey and called Ha Penny because of the halfpenny toll to cross the bridge till 1919 Also a nice place for food right beside it currently called the Woollen mills. Lovely bridge and something that always lets me know I have arrived in Dublin when I see it. Its very picturesque so if you want to get a good photo of it with no one walking on it, go early morning or in the evening. Beggars do hang out on it (the odd one or two) but they are generally peaceful and do not cause any issues) A must for all visitors. Nice views from the bridge. The HaPenny Bridge, originally known as the Wellington Bridge, is Dublins oldest pedestrian crossing over the River Liffey. It was erected in 1816 and acquired its better-known nickname from the halfpenny toll levied on all users of the bridge until 1919. The Halfpenny Bridge in Dublin is like the VIP section of the Liffey   but watch out for the bridges unofficial welcoming committee, the beggars! Theyve got the persistence of door-to-door salespeople, minus the product. Trying to cross the bridge feels like running a charity marathon   everyones got a cause, and theyre not afraid to make it known. These beggars have mastered the art of timing; they pop up just when you think youve escaped the last one. Its like a game of Beggar Bingo   how many can you dodge before reaching the other side? Maybe we should start rating them for creativity   extra points for the most original sob story? Despite the beggars best efforts, the Halfpenny Bridge remains a charming Dublin landmark. Just be prepared to tap dance your way through the charity gauntlet on your journey across   its all part of the Liffey-side entertainment! It s iconic. It s historic. It s free. Also a good way to get from Temple Bar area to O Connell st. Very pretty bridge which allows you to travel from one coast to the other and which offers a very nice view of the river! Beautiful place to feel d heart of Dublin...10 minutes of quiet observation gives you beauty of Liffey river the chaos of seagulls..busy people moving to their day to day lives...tourists enjoying the beauty and shops all around with their array of offerings I went to do the finale of the music it was magical and magnificent Happy to see this Iconic bridge in real life.. can t believe we are here!! Glad we stopped and enjoyed the sights and sounds of Dublin. 2eme visite a Dublin, on sy repere facilement je trouve, quartiers typiques irlandais,  beaux bars a proximite Merchants Arch, The Temple Bar, puis balade a Henry Street et se poser au Bewleys  Cafe pour un the of course...  bref de quoi passer un tres bon long week-end irlandais. Et aussi un accueil tres chaleureux des irlandais,  jadore Amazing how a little imperfection can make it absolutely perfect, adorable, personal. This bridge has a personality I wish some people had. The world would be a much more beautiful and compassionate. The bridge you want to hug. An icon of the city that marks a difference between the sides of the river. After you cross it and walk around the other  unpopular  side of the river with fewer tourist attractions you will find a more realistic world of the life of immigrants and low-income residents of Dublin Pedestrian bridge more than a century old connecting the Temple Bar district to the other bank of Leffey. Its name comes from the fact that you had to pay half a penny to cross it. In short, nice historic bridge allowing you to take photos of Dublin from the river but nothing extraordinary for me! The bridge is situated right in the middle of Dublin. Its a well-known tourist attraction and its always busy. You can get eateries, phone shops, shopping plazas all around it and the famous Heineken building is close by. Great for a good afternoon off and to take pictures! It was opened in 1816 as a toll bridge and stopped charging in 1919. The iconic Dublin bridge is best viewed early morning or late at night, if you want to avoid the crowds. Beautiful bridge! Fun to walk on. Cant believe that people had to pay to walk across this bridge, back then. It was cute, but the crowds were large and made it difficult to fully enjoy the beauty of the architecture. Well-known footbridge that crosses the river Liffey. The brige has plenty of character and features in the Phil Lynott music Old Town. Phil was also the lead singer and bass player of Thin Lizzy. During my recent trip to Dublin, I had the delight of walking across the historic Hapenny Bridge, and it was an absolute highlight! The bridge itself is not just a convenient crossing over the River Liffey, but a piece of art that takes you back in time with its elegant cast-iron railings and charming lamp posts. As you walk across, youre treated to stunning views of the Dublin skyline, making it a perfect spot for photos, especially at sunset. It s amazing to think about all the people who have crossed this bridge since the early 19th century. The area around the bridge is bustling with life, filled with the sounds of buskers, chatter, and the typical hustle and bustle of a vibrant city. Its a great starting point for exploring the citys north and south sides, with plenty of cafes and shops nearby to enjoy before or after your stroll. I highly recommend making a stop at the Hapenny Bridge for anyone visiting Dublin. Its a charming piece of history that connects you more deeply with the city s heritage. A beautiful 19th century example of classic engineering and architecture.  As an engineer I love seeing structures built so long ago still functional and beautiful hundreds of years later. Loved seeing it, walking across it and especially being there with my beautiful wife. Very nice historic bridge and part of every sightseeing tour in Dublin. Attractive bridge, that attracts pickpockets. Needs some signage or surveillance cameras for the tourists. The beauty is distracting, which makes for easier targets. Noticed three guys coming too close behind me, so I moved to the side to face them and they passed by. Suspicious. They kept walking from one end to the other, and crowding near people. Finally saw one guy unzip the top of a tourist s backpack wide open, he looked back and saw I was looking right at him. Sheepish smile and moved away. I caught up to the lady and told her to zip up her backpack. She was shocked and thankful. Bridge itself is cool and picturesque, but loss of stars due to neglecting tourist needs. Fabulous views of the river from here and such lovely architecture. It does seem a place homeless people sit however Dublin seems to have alot of homeless people no mater were you walk. So be generous and remember 50 cent to you maybe nothing but to someone else could mean they eat! Were excited to announce that the first annual junkie jump will take place here on 23 June 2024. Free gear for the last survivor. Should be a great family day out. Ah yes. Dublins iconic Bridge. Looks beautiful in the morning or evening sunrise. Also when theres no beggars sitting on cardboard along it. Or when theres no 16 year old dealers either end of it meeting there junkie customers to sell their bags of Crack. They use the bridge as quick getaway if the Garda turn up on an extremelyrate occasion. Disappear down liffey Street on the North side or merchants arch on the southside into temple bar. Ahhhh....beautiful memories of Dublin. If your a tourist coming here and your reading this, do yourself a favour and get out of Dublin. Its now a horrible city overrun by dealers, junkies, homeless people, beggars and Roma pickpockets. Not to mention the illegal immigrants arriving in their droves. Go down to the West of Ireland where youll see the real Ireland. Im a Dub living in Dublin by the way. One of the oldest bridges crossing over the river liffey. The name comes from when dubliners use to pay half a penny to cross over to the other side.  A portion of the money   used to be given to the boatmen,  who before the bridge was erected, used to carry people from one side of the river to the other. Historic land mark that is worth seeing if you are visiting Dublin Cross the bridge and switch to the Temple bar district...to take to move from one atmosphere to another"
90,Henry Grattan Monument,4.3,"Freestanding bronze statue of Henry Grattan, executed by John Henry Foley, erected 1876. Surmounting square-profile dressed limestone pedestal with incised name plaques to recessed panels on stepped dressed limestone base with scrolled brackets. Two former gas lamp standards with carved sea horses to east. Located on traffic island to centre of College Green facing Trinity College. A deceptively attractive man of his time, a bygone age, who was extremely biased and idealistic but had his heart in the right place. His statue has always been contentious but less than the successfully toppled Parnell. Leaving the rest of this review in his own words, I will remain anchored here with fidelity to the fortunes of my country, faithful to her freedom, faithful to her fall. You find the statue of Henry Grattan on an prime location inbetween  the Bank of Ireland and the main entrance of Trinity College. A lot of traffic there. The statue stands like on a small island. In front of trinity college. It s a meeting point for many tours. Can get quite busy. Nice to learn about the history of Ireland. Its located next to the old college. Great view of Trinity College, and close to big shopping districts Great Very beautiful statue. A Great place in Dublin, should be pedestrianised. A great place to relax and wait for friends In front of the oldest college in Ireland Nice street to walk to Highly recommended for a visit Very nice place Nice location Nice Its a statue. its henry grattan! Visitando la ciudad te puedes encontrar con diversidad de monumentos o estatuas, esta concretamente de Henry Grattan, se encuentra en una privilegiada ubicacion, enfrente de la entrada principal a Trinity College y del Banco de Irlanda, en una pequena zona ajardinada con semaforos. Beautiful memories of Ireland, especially the capital, Dublin This place is in the center of Dublin Bella statua in bronzo situata in una delle piazze piu trafficate e centrali di Dublino!!

91,Heroes cafe,4.694444444444445,"One of the nicest customer services in town. Super kind staff! Hot chocolate was fabulous and the menu has very good options for a fair price. They also have a super cool environment in the shop. Highly recommend it and will definitely be coming back in the future when Im around. Funky fun spot to have a coffee! Themed up with comic book elements, the outdoor space is perfect in these times. Affordable coffee and lovely looking milkshakes, the displays of figures inside are fun. Michele and Tony were super friendly and so into the ambiance of the coffee shop. Definitely a spot after browsing comics. Cheapest and nicest tea  1 per cup. Really nice staff. And lovely selection of coffee. A+++++ Awesome place - the figures lining the walls let you think about all the great movies, cartoons, and hero shows youve seen over the past decade while you wait for the owner to make an excellent beverage. (Ive had a selection - all were well above average!) In the heart of Dublin - worth every penny and second of the time you spend here. Should be a mandantory stop on any downtown stroll! Good staff , great location , 1  for a cup of tea at the   of Dublin Capel Street Amazing food but most importantly amazing service. Little things like giving the children free superhero masks or a free packet of sweets really makes them smile. Never rushed. Made feel extremly welcome A hidden gem for cheap yet tasty lunch around the city centre. Got a toastie with ham, cheese, tomato and onion on it along and a coffee for just a fiver, where could you go wrong! Great staff, reasonable well to be honest cheap, a tea  1, latte  2.50 , beat that, I always ask for extra hot latte, great service ,friendly staff and friendly customers cant comment on food as I havent eaten there, their lattes are beautiful, Excellent coffee, as good taste as the fancy coffee shops in town. Nice, quiet and friendly staff. Give it a try! Best Double Cappucino in town, beats all the higher price ones by a long mile. Lovely, fantastic and brilliant staff. The cookies, doughnuts and muffins are very, very good aswell. Amazing place for any superhero fan   amazing cakes, toasties, milkshakes and the prices for tea and coffee are better than anywhere Ive found in the city, plus indoor and outdoor seating Only 2.50 for a coffee and friendly service in central Dublin?  If thats not worth 5 stars, I dont know what is! Loved this place, nice coffees, ham n cheese toasty was lovely and the chicken filet roll was on another level. Good coffee for  2.50 with rain-protected outdoor area in a traffic-calmed area. Great food and coffee at a great price the highlight of my kids weekend is coming here. Knowledgeable Interested Staff and more Gundam Kits and Macross and Zoids than I could ever build!!!

92,Hidden Dublin Walks,3.736842105263158,"Fantastic tour of little known secrets of Dublins history. Hear haunting tales and visit places of the past. Very informative, a must tour when you visit Dublin. I did the Dublin North Quay guided ghost walk. Well worth it for the money. It lasted around two hours and ended at brazen head. Got to hear some very interesting history about Ireland at our different stops. I went on the Dublins Haunted History Walking Tour and our tour guide was Kate. She was fantastic! She made the tour memorable and my only regret is doing this tour on my last night in Dublin because she mentioned so many things to check out that I was unaware of during my time in Dublin. She made me want to come back to Dublin to check out more things - and I would redo this exact tour next time. Fun tour up to the Hellfire Club and a lot of history.  Definitely worth the visit, probably of any of their other offerings as well. A fun and interesting way to see a few spots around Dublin. Covers a very specific bit of the story so make sure to read or watch a documentary about the events if you arent familiar with it. The script is well written and thought out. The bus did do a bit of time killing loops and was looking a bit worse for wear on the inside. One whole side of lights was burned out and the sculpted foam interior needed a few minutes with a brush and some grey paint. All together a fun two hours but study up to get the most out of it. Scammed out of 75 euro for a Drag Bus tour that never took place. They didnt even offer another tour in exchange and instead just asked me for proof of purchase and then blamed a past employee saying they lost money on it. Still have not refunded and continue to ignore emails. Incredibly unprofessional. Its a must if you want to know more about the history of Ireland. A lot of information in a very unique way. On the other hand it is better if you read before the tour some of the Ireland independence history to fully understand everything. Actors were amazing Just went on Saturday. Excellent. Great craic and fun. Youre sure to learn something new, even if you think youre an expert. The tour stops consist of the GPO, Dublin Castle, and Richmond Barracks with witness testimonies from the time being acted out wonderfully. Be nice and leave a tip at the end. Really interesting tour, full of testimonies of the 1916 risings rebels! Tour guides will transport you back in time & to places you wouldnt have gone or heard of! Highly recommend it for Dubliners. Very disappointing tour. It just wasnt engaging at all. The actors kept changing characters. Their stories were all over the place. Good thing we had prior knowledge of Irish history, otherwise it wouldve been hopeless. Avoid. Went on this tour on 24th the day of the 100th  anniversary of the 1916 rising, accompanied by friends and family we experienced what I can only describe as 2 hours of history of that week through drama, lectures and visits to the main sights involved in the rising, our two guides where excellent both with their detailed knowledge of the events of that week and their role play of people involved in the action was second to none, I will highly recommend this tour to everyone, thanks again to all involved. Kevin from Derry Great tour around the major sites of the rising. The tour guides were very enthusiastic, entertaining and informative. Would definitely recommend the tour. I love any thing related to history nan nan nan nan nan nan"
93,High Nelly's Coffee House,4.85,"Adorable little cafe and brunch spot. There is a breakfast and lunch menu. The owner of the diner was so nice and hospitable!! We were visiting Dublin for 2 days and decided to choose a breakfast diner. This one was super affordable and delicious. The atmosphere was wonderful and the food was truly authentic. It is in a cute corner near the center of Dublin. I ordered the Full-Irish breakfast, which was perfect. The customer service was great and I felt at home! Amazingly cozy and lovely place! I popped on my way home, it was worth it The front of house man was so friendly and had a sense of humor. I had ordered veggie breakfast with over easy eggs. It was above the standard portion  tha ive had in other places. It was delicious and the price was reasonable :) Terrific breakfast at a reasonable price. Hard to find a full fry in Dublin under  10. This place is down to earth, lovely friendly staff and the fry was delicious. Ordered toast a d tea separate for a total of 12.50 I think. Truly excellent fry! Really great food and amazing service! We got the full irish and monster platter and both were absolutely delicious! :) Delicious breakfast. My favorite in all of Ireland (and Ive tried dozens!). Barry is one of the nicest guys youll ever meet. I hope hell still be welcoming folks to High Nellys after his radio show takes off. Amazing customer service from start to finish.  The breakfast was amazing. We ordered the full irish and the salmon and egg bagel and they both looked and tasted excellent. I really cannot recommend this gorgeous little cafe enough. Vegetarian options: Plenty veggie and pescatarian options on the menu. Wow! What a place! I had the Chefs Egg Benedict, and my husband had the full Irish breakfast. Everything was amazing and this was the biggest Irish breakfast weve ever had. The service is great and the staffs are all very nice and friendly. Amazing atmosphere and a great place to have a lovely time. The staff is incredibly friendly, the food is copious and tasty. I recommend it to everyone just wanting a great breakfast or to have a real Irish breakfast. Great service and breakfast, thank you for having us I had ordered a full Irish and a latte and I must say that the breakfast was just amazing. It was very filling, especially the size of the bacon was way above the standard portion that Ive had in other places. The sausages were perfectly cooked and were above average size as well. The service was great, not much waiting time and above all the cost was very reasonable considering the portions of the meal. A gem of a cafe with amazing breakfast that ll keep you going all day long. Nice staff and good solid attitude to customer service and squeezing people in. Highly recommended. From the moment we walked in we knew we d picked the right spot. The staff is delightful and funny and gave us such a warm welcome. The Irish breakfast was delicious and they were so kind to bring gluten free bread for my mom! I was lucky enough to get her portions of the regular bread which I could ve eaten a whole loaf of. I will absolutely come back here next time I m in Dublin! Dietary restrictions: They had oat milk and gluten free bread Amazing breakfast spot. The staff is lovely and they greeted the regulars by name and knew their orders. A charming place great for a slow morning, reading and having great food. Great value for it as well! A tea pot and a big smoked salmon bagel with 2 poached eggs for  13 in town is insanely cheap. Definitely going back soon. Lovely, lovely place. We shared a HUGE breakfast and were stuffed. Everything was delicious!! The Espresso was perfect. Not watery, full of flavor. We will definitely be back!! The owner creates a delightful atmosphere at this restaurant . We adore this place because of him. He is a remarkable individual, exceptionally hospitable, and the staff are outstanding. The food may be simple, but it is delicious, prepared with care. We appreciate it for the excellent service; the staff are consistently warm and welcoming, always ready with big smiles. Highly recommend! Very friendly staff. Proper mugs for tea, which were warm. Poached eggs were okay. My dad thoight the fry was excellent!Well be back again. Food Was seriously one of the best breakfasts weve had in quite some time. Lovely people there looking after us and reasonably priced given the quality and taste. Will be back! Really nice spot for Breakfast with very good coffee, friendly staff in an excellent location. One of the better Traditional Full Irish Breakfasts available in Dublin. They use very good quality ingredients, I couldnt fault any part of the Breakfast. Highly Recommended Great for an Irish breakfast but also for a lighter breakfast like yogurt with fresh fruit and fresh orange juice. The welcome is with a smile and a nice little word. You can eat there for lunch. Fast service Vegetarian options: Yogurt fruit eggs... Its true, this is the best breakfast ever. Dont visit Dublin without eating here. I popped here on my walk from Poolbeg Lighthouse to get a Full Irish Breakfast and a coffee. Its a very cozy and atmospheric coffee house, with very friendly and hospitable staff, the food was very delicious. Highly recommend stopping here for breakfast if youre visiting Dublin! Seems to be a very local place, not too touristic, we were lucky to find a place like that to try the famous Irish Breakfast. Another nice thing is that they have vegetarian option for the Irish Breakfast. Everything was delicious and the waiter was super nice. The experience was lovely! A trip to Dublin with friends meant we had to find a regular for our breakfast. Nellys fitted the bill perfectly for the three days. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, brilliant freshly cooked Irish breakfast (vegie available for my friend), thick, strong black coffee all for  13. Great service with friendly banter and a generally calm atmosphere. Highly recommend. Very generous portions, good prices given the area. Lovely service , though not the fastest -- we had to wait quite a bit for water. Food quality is decent: eggs cooked right and runny as expected. Coffee is fine, but limited offering of alternative milk (e.g. no oat milk). Nice very local place! Very nice atmosphere. Very nice service. Solid food. All you need to start the day Lovely little place and the people are super friendly. Absolutely loved the full Irish breakfast! Food was hot and the eggs were baked perfectly. The breakfast was very good. The staff was very friendly and funny. If you are looking for breakfast then this is the place! Vegetarian options: There was also a vegetarian breakfast option Nice local Cafe/ restaurant with very nice and kind service! We felt very welcome and the breakfast was delicious! They also accepted some changes to the menu without hesitation! Definitively go there if you are in Dublin! Amazing Breakfast and front of house man, who has a great memory and sense of humour. We came here two days consequitively and two of us had the monster breakfasts and a slightly modified breakfast for the third person which was spot and nothing too much trouble. Fantastic value for money. Thank you. Best Irish breakfast in town! Amazing service. We will be reminiscing and talking about the breakfasts we had here for years to come. Very nice service and lovely atmosphere. A quiet and friendly little place serving traditional cafe foods and drinks. Clearly a favourite for locals too. Barry at the till hit it off with us really well. Gave us some ideas of places to visit and things to do too! Vegetarian options: Good veggie breakfast. Thats what I had. Really great food, great service and friendly atmosphere. A real gem if youre looking for a decent Irish breakfast. Visited the place on a sunday morning and it was just lovely. The owner is probably one of the kindest person youll ever meet and it was a pleasure how he treated the guests! The food was just delicious. Had a 1/2 irish breakfast and the size was still very good. Kept me going for the whole day! If youre in dublin, its the best place to visit for a great irish breakfast experience with nice staff and amazing food! A cosy little place that makes you feel welcome. The owner is just wonderful and lovable. The food was really good and fresh. I would definitely go there again next time Im in Dublin. Very polite and friendly gentleman. Tried the full Irish breakfast here - the food was good and filling. A wonderful breakfast and lunch spot with a personable host who knows the regulars. Went several times during our stay in Dublin! Kid-friendliness: Accommodating to babe in stroller Lovely gem of a place. Fantastic food, great coffee and super friendly service. You get absolutely great value. Excellent quality food and really good value. Coffee good too. Staff very pleasant. I d come back again. Not the biggest place and on street parking is available but Dublin CoCo overcharging at  3.60 per hour. Pay point on same side as cafe. Well worth your money even allowing for Dublin CoCo fleecing motorists and making it more challenging for local businesses like here. Parking: Dublin CoCo fleecing motorists by charging  3.60 per hour. Tables were filthy and not cleaned between guests. The tea can was dirty when we got it, see the pic. Mugs they used for tea were dirty. Dirty dishes of previous customers remained on our table for a while and only got taken away bit by bit. The omelette had bits from the grill scraped on top of it and tasted like the reused oil. They got the drink orders of us and the table besides of us wrong. The wait staff was unfriendly and seemed careless. friendly staff, good food at good prices. would recommend! will go back another time! Food : 4/5"
94,Honey Truffle,4.75,"Great location and food. The salads, soups and desserts are absolutely delicious and with really interesting flavors. The sausage rolls also do not disappoint  . Perfect lunch spot to take away or seat in Came here a while ago with a friend and was really impressed with the food. It is on the pricier side for lunch but it was really the best salad pretty much ever. The cakes and sweets also taste as good as they look. Though its really popular we actually got a table quite handy because most people get food to go. If one were enterprising one might get their salad on the way to work as they open at 8am. My friend also had a coffee and said that was nice too. Vegetarian options: Just loads of vegetarian options which was great. Great vibes around this place and great location. I had the festive sandwich which probably could have used a bit more filling. I will come back and try more of the salads and stuff in the counter because they looked great. Very busy at lunchtime. Wow, the breakfast options and food are incredible, the staff is so kind and work very hard to make things fast for sit down and to go Another great spot for breakfast, this place does some super tasty cakes and healthy options if you prefer. Porridge, oats, salads etc but I must admit the pastries look and taste great. Again you ll have to wait in line for a while but it s worth the wait. Coffee is also lovely and they have plenty of options. Definitely worth a stop if you re in town. Fantastic breakfast spot for either eat in or take away. Delightfully smooth flat white and a bacon breakfast roll beautifully toasted with fresh tomatoes, greens and mayo. A friendly server and chatty atmosphere to watch the world go by. Highly recommended. We had lunch today at this place and everything we ordered was so good!! I loved the chicken and avocado sandwich and ofc the raspberry crumble was insane <3 Cant wait to come back!! This was our first stop in Dublin.  What a great choice! The selection of fresh food seemed almost endless from amazing salads, large sandwiches,  and delectable pastries and desserts. You can tell that everything is made fresh everyday.  We love how they use local suppliers for almost everything.  We ordered the veggie pita wrap, sourdough turkey panini, sweet potato tart, and berry pistachio cake. From the bread, meat, veggies, cheese, and dessert everything is fresh, crisp, and tender. Wish we could have ordered more. If we have time we will definitely be back. Thank you to all the employees at Honey Truffle. Honestly, a bit pricey. For an avocado toast, oat latte and small oat cookie, I paid 17 .  But - I needed comfort, and that was exactly what I paid for. Enjoyed every bite. Toasted seeds on the side - delish! Only minus - tap water for drinking. It tasted with chlorine. They could at least filter it. Loved the decor, funny quotes, art and a huge Beano comic on the wall. Even tiles in the bathroom were nice to look at. Ample seating at the back, casual and relaxed. Always a queue, lots of regulars, so that says something. Will come back to try some other cakes. Low key best lunch place we went to in Ireland! The food is all so fresh and delicious, and you get SO much bang for your buck - especially if you get the boxes. I literally got to try 8 different salads, and I loved all of them. Also really appreciated that this was a healthier option. I felt like a lot of the foods I had in Ireland were heavier. Definitely worth a visit. If I lived near that neighborhood, I would go there everyday! Enjoyed everything about this place! The people were so fun and friendly, and the good was incredible and full of flavor! I highly recommend the chicken and bacon sandwhich topped with a brownie. Mmmmmmmmm! My absolute favourite cafe in Dublin. Great coffee and tasty granola for breakfast and delicious quiches and salads or sandwiches for lunch . They only use the best ingredients a hidden gem in the city centre! Arrived for lunch today (before 1pm) to find very little in terms of food options available. The salad bar was empty and I was told if I wanted to wait, some rice and slaw was being prepared. This is a far cry from the great range that used to be on offer. I hadnt been here in a few months so hopefully this is just a once-off and not a regular occurrence. On this visit, I left empty handed. A restaurant where we want to taste everything: the pleasure is as much gustatory as visual. The brownies are excellent, and the toasts delicious. The hardest part is knowing when to stop when ordering :) This place is spotless! Very classy & modern, serving delicious coffee using Bailies coffee beans. They serve healthy lunch and pastries too! Spot on! Definitely will be back here to try their treats! A favourite of everyone where I work, this is a real gem. Stunning food from salads to treats, amazing flavours and variety. One of 12 nominees for Best Cafe Nationwide in 2023, its not hard to see why. The team is so friendly and welcoming it makes the whole experience a joy. Led by the vivacious Swastee (Tina) and coffee meister Robbie, its a feel-good part of the day when you drop by. Absolutely delicious! Coffee drinks were well made, breakfast porridge was exquisite, and lunch was fantastic. Looking forward to stopping here on future Dublin visits! The breakfast muffin is a favourite, also excellent sandwiches, salads and granola. Such a lovely team. Always nice to my dog! Great coffee. Wish it opened at weekends If I could give it 10 stars I would. As a salad fan (yes they exist!) this place was heaven for me. Wonderful addition to a fairly dreary Pearse Street. This is a most try place. The place is cosy and classy, the staff are so amazing Let s talk about coffee and food, If you are looking for a really amazing, delicious, best way of making coffee.. this is your place But what to say about food!! Yummy, healthy and it gives you the euphoria from small bowl of mixed salad only, and you topped up for the whole day .. I have been there for coffee & lunch and had a delicious coffee & wrap sandwich, 5 stars! I also wanted a cheesecake for my husbands Birthday and they gave me the most delicious one! Love this place! Great food prepared with love. Very good cappuccino. Limited seating inside, so we had to dine kerbside on busy street as the only minor drawback. Simply impeccable salads. Best in town. Food is just a picture on a plate, from pastries to salads. Amazing place for a quick lunch. Especially when you want nourish your body with healthy food. They have plenty of vegan salad options, sandwiches, soup, hot dishes, beautiful pastry and desserts with coffee. Few things to work on: improve coffee quality, more vegan desserts and more sitting inside as winter is coming Had a lemon cardamom cinnamon pistachio swirl that was one of the best things Ive ever tasted. Was still warm from the oven with some gooey berry goodness inside and caramelized nuts. Coffee great too. Amazing pastries and lovely breakfast. We had the granola and the porridge, both were full of flavours. Best coffee cakes and salad by a mile . Love this place . The food gets better and better . Butternut squash soup amazing as was the baked ham and cheese with fresh salads . I cannot recommend this place enough. Consistent quality food . Photos of food does not do justice . The barista at this cafe is very nice and polite. Great flat white coffee too. I dont understand why they dont have 5 stars !! Everythings perfect from the food (and my stars you have a choice!!) From the coffee thats to die for. My new favourite place for a break or breakfast or anytime ! They have amazing Salads, soups and delicious desserts. Exquisitely presented and incredibly tasty food. Cant praise this place enough! The salads are super filling with huge variety of  healthy  goodness. I just wish I worked nearer to it so I could become a regular. Staff were extremely friendly and all round great vibes. Lovely! I was overwhelmed by the variety of sweet and savory food. Everything really fresh. I had a fantastic breakfast here. Scones are fantastic. Staff is really nice and friendly. I recommend! Really funky little spot with great coffee, amazing cakes, and super friendly staff!! Small amount of seating which can be a little tight for groups, but fine for a quick break. WiFi for customers is handy. Excellent cafe with a brilliant selection of fresh sweet and savory treats. Really tasty granola with a great mix of fresh fruit. Great coffee and really friendly staff too. A lovely new cafe opened near Pearse Station and city Quay. Awesome gourmet roasted coffee and early morning grabs for breakfast. Their sausage roll with homemade tomato sauce is must try. Also houses early morning breakfast for takeaway if you are on your way to the office. Great sandwiches for lunch present also. Lovely cafe with a great selection of food and desserts. Also drinks are great. I would come again and again for hot chocolate with Baileys...mmm, delicious! Honey Truffle is a vibrant cafe with tasty/healthy breakfast and lunch options. The staff are on par with the food - always very attentive and smiley, brightening up the darkest Dublin winter morning! Special shout out to Tina, Leticia, and Robbie who always go the extra mile to ensure a great service Ben Ate here for the first time this week. The  place was packed at lunchtime and was doing a very robust takeaway trade. Staff were friendly and helpful and it s easy to order/pay etc quickly even with so many people in the place. There is a small seating area down the back. Food was good and they have a wide selection of sandwiches, salads and sweet things. Such good food, much of it gluten free. The cookie was incredible. This sandwich place is usually pretty amazing. The sambos are delicious. I drove here today at 2.30pm and it looked closed there was two staff members cleaning and one staff member telling a customer in front they only had 2 wraps left. Pointing at the only wraps in the display case. He walked out. I understand it s a busy place but for this to be the case one hour before close. Cleaning the place down and two wraps left. I asked if there was dairy in it. There was. I then asked if they had any soup they said yes. I asked if I could get some sourdough with it they said it comes with a scone I asked if there was dairy in the scone one staff member said no and another said yes. I asked if I could have some sourdough instead they said yes. I opened the bag when I left I paid  7 for soup and a heel of a piece of sourdough.  Would not recommend going there after 2pm. The place is cleared out and staff are a little unwilling to offer alternative option s."
95,Hugh Lane Gallery,4.65,"Free entry, and I went especially to see the eve of st Agnes stained glass window by Irish artist Harry Clarke. Magnificent. Its in a special room with a few other beautiful pieces by other artists. The gallery also has other beautiful works and is worth the visit. Cloakrooms cafe and gift shop also. Situated by the stunning memorial gardens which are also worth seeing. Free gallery worth a few permanent exhibits and done rotating. Definitely worth a visit! Lovely cafe downstairs, as well - amazing soup! Lots of pastries and nice pot of tea. Outdoor seating in nice weather. Great hidden gem of a gallery thats not too busy but a great variety of pieces. Thank you to the lovely lady who provided the free tour on Sunday (recommended) and gave a great overview of some of the key pieces in the gallery. Went to visit the Andy Warhol art exhibition in the Hugh Lane Gallery, and I must say it was quite an interesting exhibition. Originally the inside of the building used to be white, but now it s painted black and your able to visit the gallery for free, unless there is a famous artist on display, then you must pay an entry fee. Free galleries are always worth a visit, but if you can, get a tour. My group was guided by Iseult who took us to a choice of highlights in the gallery. I particularly enjoyed her detailed introduction on the architecture of the gallery (Charlemont House) and the history of the gallery itself. The Francis Bacon studio is an amazing exhibit, and the collection of impressionist paintings was impressive. Another highlight was the stained glass room with Harry Clarke s work. Really enjoyed this visit. Wonderful gallery, friendly staff and amazing art work Francis Bacons Studio is a must see Fab gallery with Francis Bacon Studio. We arrived an hour before closing and there were few people around so we could indulge in the exhibition. Bag storage, toilets and cafe to enjoy. Lovely shop. We came back the next day to spend longer perusing the other galleries. Recommended on a trip to Dublin. Went to the Andy Worhol exhibition in Hugh Lane Gallery. The exhibition is only available till 28th January. It was amazing to see his work in person as I am a huge fan of Marilyn Monroe. Its a small gallery but its worth a visit. They have as a time capsule the study of an artist and audio and visual information about it. Its a little tricky to find one of the wings of the gallery since its passing the gift shop. Visited on What can I say , Beautiful place to visit & its Free , They also have a wonderful little Cafe The Failte le gra cafe   which looks out only a Beautiful walled garden that looks like a little Tropical sun trap, which has chairs & tables ,I didnt sit out as it looked like it was closed,Im sure it is probably open on warmer days. The Gallery it self is Beautiful & very well kept & staff are very welcoming & pleasant, A must visit if you are in Dublin city Centre & right next to The Remembrance Garden ,which is also Beautiful & worth a visit. I will definitely be returning & re visiting their lovely little Cafe too , staff were lovely & very pleasant You really get the fact that Ireland takes arts and culture seriously. People need arts and culture so, it s free admission, guiding, kind, guards, fantastic exposed. Even a nice cafe. The Francis Bacon exhibition - Don t miss it! An experience you don t want to live without. Explore this wonderful destination to delve deeper into the world of Irish artists. The Francis Bacon Studio is a highlight, offering extensive insights into the life and work of one of the countrys most significant artists. Went to Hugh Lane Gallery for the first time yesterday and it is a gem of a gallery in Dublin. The Warhol exhibition which overlaps with Francis Bacons Studio and collection was super. All the gallery staff are so lovely and obliging too. Definitely worth the trip. fav art museum in dublin! the permanent collection is small but engaging and easy to enjoy. they even had monet and manet pieces. also loved the we can can can exhibition, really cool and eye opening. the facilities were good, with a cafe shop and coat room downstairs. the only bummer is that the andy warhol exhibition is 20 euros, an inaccessible ticket price (even if it s warhol..) This is such a wonderful gallery, I enjoyed the recent Anthony warhol exhibition very much. The building is truly wonderful from the outside. A visit to this gallery is well worth it. I recently took my first trip to the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin, and I was thoroughly impressed! I went to see the Andy Warhol exhibition, which exceeded my expectations. The Gallery went to tremendous efforts to showcase the works of this great artist. The building itself is elegant, well-preserved, clean, and hosts security/support staff throughout the building. An additional benefit upon this trip was seeing the perfectly restored art studio of Irish legend Francis Bacon, located within the building. Between the exhibitions, the Irish art work, and Bacon studio, a trip to the Hugh Lane Gallery is a highly recommend trip for anyone in Dublin. It requires paid-entry, it is wheelchair friendly throughout, and had a cafe, toliet facilities, shop, and a room to leave your bag and coats. Very cool exhibition. Enjoyed seeing some vintage Warhol classics. Very nice gallery. Well supervised. Got the fantastic opportunity of visiting  Andy Warhol three times out exhibition at  the Hugh Lane Gallery Wonderful space and a beautiful collection of iconic pieces, installations and collaborations. Certainly not to be missed if one gets the chance to. Visited on Visited the Andy Wsrhol exhibition, very enjoyable. Also saw again the Harry Clarke stained glass windows and the Francis Bacon studio, 2 must-sees in this excellent neat gallery. A wonderful Francis Bacon exhibition, classical interiors and cool cafe, bookshop and garden Love the building itself and the year round art exhibitions, Andy warhol exhibition is worth a visit. Disappointed by the gift shop, wanted to buy actual prints from the Andy Warhol exhibition but none were available Nice gallery with modern art as well as impressionist masterpieces by Monet, Manet and Degas plus Francis Bacon studio and collection. There was also a temporary exhibition of childrens paintings. It is a rather small gallery but the admission is free and it is definitely worth visiting it. Check the opening hours before coming in (I think it is closed on Mondays). What a discovery! Perfect sized museum with an astonishingly interesting collection of art. No entrance fee! Strong focus on Irish artists, such as Keats. My highlights: the original studio of Dublin-born Francis Bacon and 6 unfinished portraits by Bacon. And a room with several big paintings by Sean Scully. Impressive rooms, beautiful old building. Also nice: little cabinet with masterpieces of stained glass. Nice cafe. I visited the Hugh Lane Gallery while in Dublin for the Andy Warhol exhibition. Great exhibition, the staff was really friendly and helpful. There is a cloakroom (free of charge), a cafe and a gift shop. Pretty good gallery to visit. One of the rooms were empty as you walk through it. I assumer there would normally be works in there but not during my visit. Well heated which was nice, seating for viewing the paintings was nice. A couple of famous artists like Jack B. Yeats. The one very cool exhibition of the unbelievably messy studio of one artist, provided quite the entertainment for my art class and I which visited as part of our course. No parking really nearby, maybe street parking if youre lucky. Agree with the description of a hidden gem. Initially disappointed that several displays were in transition; the Bacon exhibit was interesting, and there were some surprising treasures in the legacy trust section (Manet, Monet, Degas and Rodin). Even the shop had some interesting finds. Definitely worth a visit. Lovely museum currently exhibiting the Andy Warhol collection until January 28th. We went to the Andy Warhol exhibition. The exhibition itself was very impressive, however, the staff was behaving more unpleasantly toward the end of the opening hours. Make a time reserve to visit to avoid this situation. A hidden gem. We stopped in here because it started to rain, but it was a highlight of the trip to Dublin. Interesting art (eg Jack Yeats, W. B. Yeats brother), and particularly fascinating to see Francis Bacons studio. We came especially to see the Warhol exhibition. Some classic pieces, together with a decent sound of early sketches. Slightly spoiled by the chaotic gallery layout. We have no idea if we saw it all! Some fine impressionist works in the other galleries. Bacons studio is almost as messy as mine A stunning gallery with lots of excellent paintings. I visited the Andy Warhol exhibition which is extensive. The cafe serves good coffee, but the cakes are expensive. Small collection of nice Irish and European art. Admission is free. The first floor was closed when we visited. In for the Andy Warhol exhibition and tour which was brilliant. Dublin modern art gallery, covering distinctive European artists from Bacon, Clark, Degas, Henry, Lavery, Monet, Manet, Scott, Shelly, Yeats. All on one floor, 2 mins from Parnell Luas. Cafe and toilets too. Also free. Museum with the right size to enjoy all the pieces. The collection has artwork from very famous painters plus a good selection of Irish painters. The highlight of the gallery is the workshop of Francis Bacon, and the multimedia content about his work and his life. Even if you are not a Bacon fan, you learn from his process as a painter. Probably my favourite gallery in Dublin. Free entrance promotes culture to people across different classes. The building itself is quite nice: long corridors, lots of light and a few benches for visitors to sit and take some instants to observe portraits. The weekly concerts at noon here are incredible, expertly chosen performances in an incredibly important and historic building amongst some of the most notable paintings and sculptures of mainly European artists. The Francis Bacon studio is one of the key attractions here, completely unique. Fantastic gallery, suggested by a local. Beautiful art pieces, from classics to impressionists. Very nice architecture, and relatively calm and easy to get around. Highly recommended! Wonderful art gallery, just across the road from the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin. It has a cafe, shop, free locker room for visitors and a lift. It hosts free Sunday concerts at various times throughout the year. Its free to visit, but donations help towards its upkeep. Amazing free gallery of modern and earlier works with a well stocked bookstore. Staff are very friendly, and you will easily spend an hour or two walking around the gallery rooms while it is raining outside. we experienced some inconvenience because we were not allowed into the Andy Warhol exhibition, despite the fact that we arrived 40 minutes before the end.  But the administration came out of the situation and offered us two free tickets for a date convenient for us.  Thanks to the museum administrator for his ability to work with clients, we were satisfied. ,This gallery is definitely one of my favorite locations in the city."
96,Insomnia Coffee Company,4.3,"Lively place, good coffee. We ordered small cappuccinos, and were pleasantly surprised at the cup size, more like a large! Insomnia setting in Great little coffee shop in convenience store. Large glass windows to people watch on the main street. Very friendly, accommodating service. Theyre all good but this one on Dame St is my personal fave Good variety of food and drink. Tables to watch the street traffic. Great coffee and good pastries for the early morning before you start your day. Ordered a matcha latte my usual order in my local insomnia and it wasn t up to par at all it wasn t well stirred the powder was lumpy at the top undrinkable I threw it out straight away. And they didn t take my insomnia loyalty card. Perhaps it was the early start - about 720ish - but there was definitely a palpable tension in the shop when we entered... the guy serving us came across with barely restrained anger in a polite manner... which was odd... tried sitting in the comfortable chairs and the guy cleaning must have eaten the same grumpy pie as the other lad as he told us we couldnt sit there...in a certain tone though... the barrista made the coffee which I thought was a bit weak ... I suppose the place is suitable for a quick drop in but I think I will pass the next time.. Very good coffee, very good raspberry pistachio cake and the asian barista is very skilled and kind. Very large chain of coffeeshops in Ireland. I really like the name. We just grabbed a cappuccino. The coffee was way too hot, not drinkable, to be honest. The staff was very nice though. Be careful, there are no toilets in the coffeeshop. Great Late night/Early morning coffees or Hot chocolates. Staff Great. Security excellent - so safe haven in the early hours. So lovely place, good experience, good chairs, it was comfortable to stay there. If you dont like your coffee then, ask for another. The usually get them just right but younger the very odd bad un! Coffee was good and must try their muffins. Delicious place The doughnuts were awesome, couldnt sign for nothing more. So yummy Needed a coffee, got what I need, end of the story. The security guy was really nice Amazing coffee!!!! Lauren is my favorite barista!!! Food The lad at insomnia and the spar helped me in a dicey situation l. Really appreciated it. Need good, EARLY morning coffee? HERE! Nice place a lot of different coffees The best hot chocolate I have tried. Okay busy coffee shop come store, too busy and noisy for a business meeting Good coffe and good cakes selection Good place to learning or meet up with someone Wow!!! Very good coffee Coffee is coffee same as anywhere clean shop it is what it is . Very friendly staff Beautiful No normal coffee Good service Tasty Good price Ok I like this place Good coffee Es una cafeteria grande por lo cual siempre hay espacio, buen lugar para tomar cafe y trabajar o leer un rato . Market pahali,dame strette oturmak icin dinlenmek icin ugrayabilirsiniz. Personale gentile"
97,Insomnia Coffee Company - Abbey St,3.85,"Little break at snack time Hot chocolate with whipped cream and marshmallow. Quiet atmosphere Ideal for having a coffee at any time We needed caffeine before exploring two of Dublin s largest toy stores that are located directly down the street. Therefore, we stopped here knowing nothing about the place. The service was expedient, and the place is huge. There is plenty of seating for casual hangouts and for working. The coffee was also good. We got two dirty chia lattes and a strawberry lemonade. They look to have delicious pastries if you desire. Overall, great place for a quick caffeine stop. Enjoy. Unfortunately I had a terrible experience in this coffee shop! I got there at 5pm got a coffee sat and I was enjoying it, when at 5:25 they literally kicked me out! I was shocked!!! After I paid almost 5 euro for mediocre coffee I even got kicked out! One of the waitresses started to walk around shouting very loud  shop is closed ! If I knew the place was closing I wouldn t have stayed! I will never be back again in an insomnia coffee shop! The coffee here was very flavorful and the berry and seed muffin was pretty good. Good place for a quick stop. (for the Americans basically a less snobby Starbucks) Great place for a cup of coffee and relaxing Their coffee sizes are just unbelievable larger than a normal. And very good coffee I have to say. Good to read and wait for something if you need . Quiet and warm. Definitely will be back. Lovely ambience. Plenty of seating even though it s a busy area. The staff is also attentive and quickly process orders. Sandwiches, muffins and pastry items available too. My favorite is the signature hot chocolate. Nice location, just next to the Luas. The coffee is not that good. Comfortable seats. Affordable and reasonable price. Im from Australia. Your banana bread should be fried and added with butter. Your banana bread will taste better Food No employees to be seen. Been waiting for 15 minutes. Great location and plenty of space and tables. However youll need to be careful who you order the coffee from! Older lady trying to upsale and offering different roasts or any other additions without telling you how much extra it would be and some its not on the menu... Comfortable place with nice options from hot drinks to great snacks and desserts Easy access and kind staff Amazing place to take a coffee I visit this beautiful place called Insomnia Coffee Company yesterday. At the same time is in de middle of the downtown, when you enter the atmosphere is perfect! It s a comfortable coffee, the waiters was amazing and have a delicious expresso coffee! It was a very good experience and I recommend the visit. A nice place for a coffee date, or a study space, its a bonus that the coffee is all nice Busy place with good coffee and above average pre-prepared food. A convenient place for a coffee where you can sit down and watch the world go by or have a meeting with a friend. The cake selection is not great but at least coffee is always tasting the same. The hot chocolate is great   really nice! Taste fab!!!! Unfortunately I didn t have a good experience with staff - the  girls  never in a god mood to serve clients :/ Tried the new Voyager coffee. A-MA-ZING. Love the sweet, chocolatey aftertaste, quite different to the other coffees Nice and cosy place. Good music. Coffee ils vert tasty. Wifi. Menus from 6,25 EUR. Insomnia is my favourite Coffee chain. The coffee is consistently good across most branches I have visited. This branch is a great oasis in the North City shopping madness. I went there after some Christmas shopping. Lots of seating, and nice friendly staff. Had the triple sandwich selection; delicious. And great value if you buy with a hot drink. Which I did. A very tasty large cappuccino. Served in a real cup too. Recommended. I just asked them a question and the lady was very rude to me, the other lady was nice but still wouldn t recommend going here. This place Doesn t deserve even one star. Terrific It does coffee. Its a chain. Be careful though, they offer two beans (dark or medium) but one costs 20c extra which they dont make clear. It says this on the menu, on a different page to the costs of the coffee. I only got takeaway so cannot comment on the food or premeses. Shop at Jervis is very friendly and helpful. Perfect meet up with friends for a quick coffee and location is easy to find for traveller like me. Its got light snacks and lovely cakes. Coffee is decent, staff friendly. If not meeting friends then just watch the world go by as you work with Wi-Fi and large window views of the streets and down. coffee quick service tidy place spacious Food : 5/5 | You just cant go wrong with a proper coffee in insomnia, & a toasties, absolutely gorgeous, staff really nice & v.good at there job. They were very quick and the staff were very nice. The coffee was great and my friend loved the carrot cake. Parking: It was in Dublin City so there was no local parking This is a great stopover location for those who are waiting for the Luas service as its next to the Luas stop. The cofffee was excellent and all flavours are avaiable to suit your taste . I have been here a few times. Seems very well run. The coffee is nice. Definitely a cafe I like to visit. Really nice and big insomnia but has a cosy feel to it, staff were very friendly and overall good experience Service was quick and friendly pity can t say the same about their blueberry muffin, stale, very dry, chewy and more like a vanilla flavour with a blot of blueberry colour. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!   2.60 down the drain. NEVER AGAIN! This place is right beside my gym so Ive been quiet a few times for a hot chocolate when meeting friends. I rarely eat here as I think its over priced for what you get! For a drink its fine though! Lovely cuppa, very clean and the staff were very polite Handy location for a modern coffee shop.  Like all Insomnias the coffee is good and strong.  What I really like about this place is that theres several charging docks to make sure your devices dont run out of juice. For a quick cup of coffee, although I am pretty sure my medium coffee was large.. if it was indeed a medium cup  I will go again for large again. Long waiting time and in the end I got coffe that i didnt order. Really bad experience + coffe needed 25 min to cool down to drinkable temperature. I was the first customer of the day, so it was not busy at all and I had the feeling that I am bothering the two ladies. Unfriendliest customerservice. Big mistake to come here. Love this coffee shop, great coffee and not as expensive as bigger chains. Staff were not spectacular but acceptable, and its a nice place to sit in and chill. Wow fabulous new  summer drinks menu Not clean, unfriendly staff, copped an insomnia in the spar across the road and was jealous we didn t go there , would give 0 stars if I could, avoid!!! Nice Costa coffee shop beside Jervis Luas stop. Plenty of room. Good selection of coffees and pastries. Relaxing atmosphere.  Friendly staff."
98,Insomnia Coffee Company - St Stephens Green,4.125,"Just had a really lovely experience in Insomnia Stephen s Green. Thank you, Deanna. Ps. The hot chocolate is UNREAL. Super cute place, great coffee and amazing staff. Lovely cup of tea, better than the other coffee shop chain. View of the park and horse carriages outside. My new favourite coffee shop!  The macchiatos are made perfectly. Try the carrot cake!  Very friendly and helpful staff including the barista that pulled out her own phone to check the balance on my Leap Card for me. Another chain to face Starbucks, Costa Cafe and Cafe Nero. The latte is very good. Milkshake was delicious but RITA gave me  probably one of the worst hospitality services I ve ever received from any business in my life The BEST flat white with coconut in town. And look how proud they are about the result. In love with this coffee shop and the amazing staff. One of Insomnias best outlets. This Cafe is unusual as it is very long and narrow but it is great for meet ups. Coffee, service all top notch. I love Insomnia. This Insomnia is so handy, right opposite St Stephens Green Park. It is small but cosy and offer lots of options for hot drinks and snacks. Vegetarian options: They have a really tasty mozzarella and tomatoe panini. Kid-friendliness: They were friendly and kind to us with our toddler. Wheelchair accessibility: This cafe is located on the ground floor so it is accessible. Unfortunately their toilets are based downstairs so they do not have wheelchair accessible toilets. Update December 2023: Same as before, Insomnia is probably one of my favourite chains Not a huge fan of the chain coffee shops but an insomnia is an insomnia and I couldnt find fault with this one, so had to give it the 5!   Staff were nice when I visited twice last week early in the morning and seating is comfortable, PLUS youre a literal hop skip and jump away from Stephens Green across the road Was My fav place when I was in Dublin, so many breakfast there. Very good space, nice place to relax or take a fast caffeine shot. Kind employees aswell. I was attracted to a publicity photo outside the venue where it showed wonderful and consistent hot chocolate. Greedy, I then decided to go in and order what they advertise in the photo. Much to my discomfort I received a very bad chocolate with no texture that looked a lot like milk with added cocoa. I then asked the reason for this difference and they replied that the product was the correct one. I therefore pointed out that the advertising is very misleading, leaving the glass of chocolate just sipped on the counter, because it is undrinkable. This is my favourite coffee shop in Dublin. The staff are so friendly and always ...or nearly always remember my order. Obviously new staff wouldnt. Really important as I cant take caffinated coffee.  Nice selection of pastries and savory foods.  Vegetarian and vegan options also.Very relaxing atmosphere to sit and read or people watch.  Right beside Stephens Green Shopping Centre and Grafton St. Have never had a bad experience there. Highly recommend a visit. Vanilla matcha latte my favorite! Had a nice coffee, they really know how to make an oat milk cappuccino, I did bring a cake I bought at another Insomnia into the store and now I can t sleep. It s been six days and I feel so guilty like the cake was from outside but it was still from an insomnia store but not the one I was in. Please help I m currently in a paradox and I can t get out. Staff are so friendly, cappuccino was great, perfect coffee roast My favourite city centre coffee shop by a long shot - i walk past many closer coffee shops (including other insomnias) on my lunch break to go here. The staff are always very welcoming and friendly, Karolina and her staff are brilliant. The food is always fresh, the coffee is lovely and the shop is clean tidy and comfortable for customers to relax. The are setting the bar for insomnia keep it up guys Pleasant staff, decent coffee. Wi-Fi is free. I went there with the sole intention of getting a coffee. Now, I go there to talk to the phenomenal staff, who are the single, most friendly people to deal with. Ive never in my life come across staff that are as terrific and lovely as these guys. Oh, and the coffee is great too. Coffee and buns were nice. The shop itself was clean and well maintained but its a bit small and pokey. Not a place to sit and hang out. Too small for that. Very good location and very comfortable and handy if you want to go for a walk also in St.Stephens Green Park. This establishment openly discriminates against Irish citizens based on their personal health/medical status. No vaccine passport, means no sitting inside like a human being with your family or friends. This is morally repugnant, unconstitutional, unethical, unlawful, and blatantly discriminatory against law-abiding and respectful Irish citizens. Its beyond disgusting how this is even allowed. Comfy chairs at the back but nothing special about this cafe. And the coffee is mediocre. Nice coffee shop retreat in city centre and thanks to the guy at the next table for giving a loud oration of his version of irish north/south history to his visiting friend Had a great coffee here, staff were super nice and quick. Great location, definitely will be back again. Was asked to show my covid pass which I fully understand is the law, but when the 2 people behind me were not asked and the person in charge is just blatantly rude I will never use this firm again , coffee was luke warm and mediocre at best. Very bad device. Ignored the order I gave and tried to give me the wrong product in the wrong size.  Said it was too late to correct this as I had already paid.  Not going to come here again I love this location. this luxurious chocolate hot choco, is the nicest place if your around town. staff are so friendly & helpful and seating is very cosy! Everyone sitting inside of this cafe was having their coffee in to-go-cup. Not nice. Are you too tired to clean normal ceramic cups or what? There was also a bottle of water from which you could pour yourself a water - and again in a plastic cup. Even in Mc Cafe you have a water in a glass! And finally, I ve ordered myself a Caramel Macchiato - expecting a small macchiato with a caramel sirup or whatever. I ve got a big cup of Capuccino. Is this then the right way to call it? A Macchiato? ... Very friendly staff, tasty coffee. A nice place to stop by Good variety of seats and staff where friendly here when I had a question. Coffee is nice and other drinks to the price is reasonable depending on what drink you get. Expensive coffee at  4 for what I would normally get (Short Americano with a extra shot )but lovely and strong Staff is quick and friendly. Its quiet and and good if you want to relax or study or work. I wouldnt go wit a big group Great coffee, great service and Kelly was very professional and patient with a difficult customer while I was there. Must taste. Different hot drinks, good place for short brake. Normal irish prizes, but two Spanish workers are despectivs. I don t know for what reason. Honestly I won t come back. The name of one of them is Diego. Love the coffee here in a nice relaxed atmosphere, always a newspaper available to browse through.  Nice range of pastries and sandwiches etc. Their hot chocolate is to die for. MUST try while in Ireland! Good place for a coffee/lunch. Busy at times but staff are always nice and coffee is good"
99,Irish Family History Centre,4.515151515151516,"A story that had to told... Thank you for telling the story! An informative and wonderfully interactive exhibition of Irish history. The building has been creatively repurposed and is fitting for this museum. Its called Epic for all the right reasons. Amazing source of the history of Ireland. There is also a Geneology Dept...you need an appt...but they are available (@a fee) to help find more information on your family. (They do one at a time). During my appointment I realized how important it is to utilize a professional to research your family history.  Public documents are often hard to uncover because of changed names, missing data, and other issues.  In an hour, My specialist was able to trace back four generations and find the specific property lots where my relatives might still reside.  Road trip ahead!  Thanks What an amazing and insightful session with Patrick at the Irish Family History Centre! The family information and history he was able to access blew us away -- he really is the ultimate investigator in genealogy. Patrick does not give up and was just as excited by the discoveries as we were. Highly recommend a visit to the centre if you have any interest in learning more about your Irish roots. I brought my mother up to the Irish Family History Centre as a Birthday activity. She has always been interested in her family history and I thought this would be a nice afternoon for us to spend together. We spent an afternoon in the Irish Family History Centre working with Genealogist, Patrick Roycroft. It was a fantastic experience and we found out so much about our family history that we never expected to uncover. It was a pleasure to work with Patrick who was full of knowledge and genuinely as excited as we were to connect the dots and retrace so many layers of our family from over the years. We found the consultation so useful that we doubled our time. Patrick was very efficient, wasted no time and gave us the information we needed to continue exploring our familys past after our visit. We have every intention of going up again to explore other parts of our family tree as on our last visit we gained information that we never would have expected to come across or even known to look for. We wouldnt have been as successful on our own and it most certainly helped to speed up the process! We would highly recommend a visit to this fantastic resource centre. Looking forward to our next visit. I did an online consult through zoom with Maura who did a nice job showing websites to use. Maura was very good. What was not good, was that part of the consult was supposed to include a month s use of the findmypast web site. I was told i would get a code via email in 2-3 weeks. Nothing yet and I have followed up as Maura had suggested with the folks that scheduled the session and have not received any response at all in a month and a half. I really recommend a visit to this centre.  The staff are particularly helpful and knowledgeable on Irish  family history/searching matters. I would suggest however, that you undertake a little research yourself,  before you leave home. This will assist  your researcher by really focusing on your ancestors/family,  eliminating the need to troll through unnecessary records, and therefore giving you flexibility with your budget. Fees are reasonable, but come in half hour blocks.  I found that I needed more time than that.  I have some  experience in searching archives. Amazing researchers .You must book in advance. It s a scam.  We have a family tree and know who our Irish ancestor was.  No help from them at all.  I left with NOTHING new.  Save your 12.50.  I was excited to learn something new but all they did was direct me to websites I could look at at home.  Computers WiFi was slow and outdated.  AVOID.  Worst experience of my entire week in Ireland Whether you are just starting your family tree research or well along youll get much deeper into your ancestral origins here.   Guides help you use online resources and you will surely leave with certificates of birth, marriage, and death for numerous members of your family tree.  You might also discover land holdings, values and locations.  I was able to purchase 2 one-hour sessions with a genealogist which were very informative and productive and a real catalyst for my research - thanks Patrick! Great museum. Modern and very informative Very informative for my friend to track down his family heritage and free. Really enjoyed this experience. Very well done Had an appointment with a genealogist. Excellent experience. Felt like a tourist trap and/or scam. Great place to visit. Wonderful museum. Guinness truck in Dublin Ireland Great adne miejsce.

100,Irish Museum of Modern Art,4.5,"The museum which is located inside an old but beautiful hospital building was quite underwhelming. The exhibitions were small and mediocre at most. Eventhough the entry was free I can not really recommend to go here. However, the people who work there are nice and can give you some background information when asked. The grounds and gardens  are very pleasant  to visit and walk around. Museum wasnt open day we went there but will definitely go back another time. The building looks impressive from outside and the coffee was good from the food truck located  in the courtyard The grounds, garden and museum itself are nice to wander around in summer or in winter Lovely museum and entrance is free! There is also a cafe on site and a lovely garden The museum is in two buildings, so make sure to see both! Visited on I had an amazing time at the Irish Museum of Morern Art. Its a fantastic place for both children and adults to learn about modern art. The habitats are well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. This beautiful art gallery is a must-visit! It offers frequently changing exhibits, spacious grounds perfect for exploring, and a welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere. Im always impressed by the variety of the exhibitions - theres something for everyone. I appreciate how often they change, keeping things fresh. The gardens provide a lovely space for strolling or a picnic on a sunny day. The inclusion of both a cafe and a coffee truck offers convenient options for refreshments. The fact that the museum itself is free makes it accessible to all, and while the parking does have a cost, its great to have that option on-site The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) is a must-visit for anyone interested in contemporary art. The museum is housed in a beautiful historic building, which adds to the overall experience of exploring the diverse collection of modern artworks. Visited on If you enjoy Modern Art, you will enjoy this. I most enjoyed the grounds and learning the history of the building. Some of the art goes beyond my comprehension and is therefore less enjoyable. But as it changes, you never know what you might see. The museum is free entry, with a donation if you are interested. The information centre about the building is also free. I was expecting good weather first of all. We didnt go around coz were already totally wet. So we visited just exhibitions inside of the building. And want to say huge THANK YOU to guide who made us short input in Old man house. As for ppl out of Ireland it was short and in understandable English. And in toilet there are free pads and tampons. Beautiful location, an old hospital turned into a modern art museum -not so excited about the exhibition. Beautiful building, really lovely. grounds for stroll... very welcoming public building... well worth a visit... plenty of festivals and exhibitions to choose from.. Child friendly,  highly recommend. Visited on A little difficult finding the exhibits, but once we found them, it was beautiful, and the outdoor area was very well maintained as well. Cafe had a great selection. Loved it. I am generally not a huge fan of modern art, but this time the exhibition was superb. Beautiful space with lots room, nice cafe outside with some baked goods and great coffee. However, the highlight was the garden! Definitely recommend when in Dublin. Although we didnt venture inside the building other than to locate the restaurant we found it so beautiful. If you are into architecture and history you will love it. There are lots of art pieces scattered around the outside of the buildings and kept us guessing (we made a fun hunt for adults and children). There was a cute little cafe stationed inside the courtyard but not in the building and a restaurant downstairs in what can only be described as bomb shelters. We loved it  . The food was delicious and the seating was spacious. Unfortunately our group opted to sit outside to eat as not everyone had covid certs at the time. The gardens would make for a lovely stroll for couples and they are kept beautifully - even when no flowers are blooming there is a lovely feel about the place. Pity about some of the buildings that tower over... thankfully not a complete eye sore. There is a little miniature castle like structure at the end of the gardens that really peaks your interest. You can only look inside the ground floor but it doesnt stop everyone. I would encourage visitors to read up on the garden quite a bit as so many designs, structures and placements of flowers have a meaningful purpose behind them. We will be visiting again in warmer weather! quiet and spacious courtyard. small exhibitions here and there. wouldnt say its the national museum of modern art as claimed in terms of its curation and pieces on display  but i mean its free. The museum is free, it is located in a former casern in a beautiful building with a court in the middle. It was offering an exhibition about diaspora and how Irish people migrated and  explored many other countries. It was an omen to the spirit of adventure, into the unknown. The exhibition was interactive where we could put some earphones on to listen to different interviews about art and how it is perceived. It was talking about freedom of expression and its opposite,  censorship through older material like newspaper articles, faxes,  letters, etc... A fascinating experience! I recommend it. This is a really nice museum. I absolutely adored the paintings I saw, I really loved Patricia Hurls art and the way she executed the paintings. I cannot say the same thing for the exhibition that was held. It was quite hard to understand what the artist wanted to say but the people working there explained it to us. The garden was to die for, we were lucky and were there on a sunny day. Absolutely gorgeous. The gift shop was interesting and had books for many types of art, I bought a book about geography and politics and it looks interesting. If you are visiting Dublin I suggest you visit this museum! Loved the painting displays, collection of abstract art and other works. Definitely worth the walk in and around. Wall art was really nice too. They could add more exhibitions and sculptures, most of the rooms were empty probably in progress which is good. It has a great garden. Good for strolling after seeing the gallery very cool art gallery in beautiful grounds. the exhibitions are relatively small and i would advise 1-3hrs here depending on how long you want to watch the videos for - you could easily spend a full day though if you wanted to watch all exhibition videos from start to finish! entry was free with just a donation advised. i went on a weekday and it was lovely and quiet - for the first hour Im sure I had the entire museum to myself! there is also a gift shop with lots of art books and cute gifts to buy too. A good place to get inspired and enjoy the artworks.  Plenty of modern art exhibits from local and abroad. Museum is free access! Very very beautiful exterior cathedral, with beautiful gardens, a feast for the eyes. However, the 8  entry is not really justified... there are audio guides provided as well as a booklet in many languages, as well as a nice shop, perhaps a cheaper entry without audio guide would be more justified. The interior is not very big but remains a very beautiful place! First time to visit. My daughter and I went, we drove and parked which for us was preferable, parking is 3e/3hrs so not bad. The tickets were free for us. We booked but I am not sure it was necessary. The venue and location is gorgeous. Very relaxing oasis in the city with some short walks and a lovely formal garden. The museum building is beautiful. There was a coffee van with a limited selection of pastry, hot drinks, and at few cold drinks. When we went into the entrance we were not sure where to go. The qr code map is really poor and didnt help and unfortunately the person on the desk didnt make any suggestions. Finally there was a shift change in one gallery and the lady there pointed out where everything was. The work spaces were interesting and we loved the Howardena Pindell exhibition. The visit was worth it for that. Overall we were a little disappointed there was not more to see. Seemed kind off limited for a big enough venue. Its still a nice place to visit with older children or adults especially if its good weather and you fancy a picnic. I would definitely look into what exhibitions are on at the time if visit before you go as it could make or break the trip I visited the museum on Sunday with my friends. Is free to visit. I reached out by 83 bus and then walking 30 minutes by Guinness Storehouse, Houston Train station and then entering on the side with the parking, not the park. The walls of the building are very robust, made of stone. The building is a square that holds tree modern art expozitions. One green, one blue and one on first floor. In the middle of the buildings there is a Cupola. You can also find here a food truck and benches for eating. We saw that main entrances conect the square and the parking or park. We visited the park as well, it is nice and quiet, so you might also see a hedgehog or a kitten. Enjoy! We had a warm, lovely and sunny day. They have very interesting artworks and pieces! I truly recommend exhibitions on the first floor! Gift shop is full of catchy and witty stuff people who complain don t understand modern art is because you don t use your imagination,or let s say didn t let your imagination take you to where or to some extent. it s a great museum and a few intriguing exhibitions. interesting thing is how artist use metaphors to make mundane life interesting Did a Tour with Tommy  OPW Guide very nice Chap .Lots of interesting facts and stories. Well worth a visit. I visited the museum on a Tuesday morning which was the most peaceful timing to go there. The museum has exhibitions on various contemporary themes which might be a bit heavy to grasp at first, but definitely a great way to learn more about current issues. The workers of the museum were helpful and friendly when I had questions about the locations of the exhibitions (as they are in separate parts of the buildings). Recommended if you are interested in political and cultural topics. As part of my architecture coursework, I had to visit the Irish Museum, and I would encourage others to do the same because of the wonderful gardens and the buildings. Certainly worth the trip out and a browse around. If more for its location and the beauty of the courtyard and the old hospital building it is housed in, than the quality of the art and the exhibitions here. Im not a fan of modern art but I still enjoyed the experience. even if the views from the museum windows are sometimes more exquisite than the paintings! Theres also a shop for visitors, a cafe and restaurant located across from it. A must for all lovers of modern art. Visiting the museum is free of charge. The concept of each installation is explained, becoming accessible even to the less experienced. The outdoor garden with the tree-lined avenue is even more beautiful in this season. Very cool pieces to see and many different exhibits to check out. Would recommend spending time at each exhibit with no expectations, as each piece has a message of its own. The staff was kind, the giftshops were nice, and overall I had a great time. We had a great day there, Id highly recommend it. wow! Definitely took my breath away. The museum grounds are incredible with the garden and square and the exterior art instal. Was there between exhibits so not everything open but the Freud exhibit made up for it. Friendly staff, the cafe in basement is very charming loved the pea/ feta salad. It was a rainy day but that made the experience so much better. For those curious about modern art! check the site for current exhibitions and temporary exhibitions. I go there whenever I pass through Dublin for the walk and the discovery, plus the museum is free. I always find something interesting there but it depends on each persons affinities, we dont end up there by chance. An underrated contemporary art gallery that always has interesting surprises whenever I visit. Gallery spaces are varied in size to allow everything from big works to more intimate settings for  smaller  pieces. Not far from Heuston Station and the network of buses that terminate there so it s easy to get to even though it s not right dead center in the  action .

Great honour to have my Pride Rainbow Jacket to go on display in our history museum to be part of the LGBTQ+ section showcasing LGBTQ+ history and moments in time. My Rainbow jacket has been at over 100 plus events and prides. Love going to this place at random times to explore other areas of our history. Plus this is all free Anything is possible under the concept of modern art. ;-) Visited imma in march this year and i really enjoyed it! it was very interesting seeing modern art for once. The exhibitions i saw had great depth and meaning behind them and i enjoyed my guided tour :) would visit again!"
101,Irish Music Wall of Fame,4.315789473684211,"We didn t actually visit the Irish Rock n Roll Museum but if you re with a group heading towards Temple Bar, it s worth a photo stop. It s a good talking point for tourists who may (or may not!) know some of the great figures in Irish music. Very nice pub with good live music and unique decoration. A little bit expensive when compared with other pubs in the area. They offer concerts every month during the whole year. It is worth the visit. I enjoyed viewing the wall. Our tour guide was very thorough. A grand red wall near  the temple bar  dedicated to the heavyweights of Irish music such as U2, Phil Lynott, Rory Gallagher, Sinead O Connor and many other names. Magnificent wall. Possibility to visit the interior also. Ive seen this building outside before. I havent been there yet but Id really love to visit it someday in the future. Im sure this place sounds very interesting. Great! The waiters removed our full glasses of whiskey twice when we where not looking. It seems they are trained for that... Terrible experience. Cool spot. Lively atmosphere. Vibrant street Very cool experience Awsome Varem passar per davant, pasagen per Dublin Sehr cool. Hat uns dazu animiert das Museum zu besuchen.

Nice summary of the major Irish musicians Pub a little expensive compared to the local average, already very touristy. Like a wall, ok...a tribute to Irish, pop rock, musicians...

102,Irish Whiskey Museum,4.675,"Can t recommend this place enough! We did the classic tour (3 tastings). Was so much more than just a whiskey lesson - we learned so much about Ireland throughout history! Our tour guide Keith was so knowledgeable, entertaining, and easy to follow. Will definitely make a return visit on a future trip. What an experience to learn about the history of where the term whiskey comes from and means. Your staff and tour were absolutely incredible and welcoming to a first time Canadian from Vancouver visiting your beautiful city of Dublin, Ireland. The choices I had on the premium tour were very tasty and well described to enjoy. I decided to buy the Irishman Legecy bottle at the airport to bring home after trying the standard Irishman version. I cannot wait to try this again. Thank you again everyone and a must stop for anyone in Dublin looking for an adventure. I went alone and had a GREAT time. Definitely worth a visit! I didnt know much about whiskey about the fact that I like it and I heard some nice reviews about this museum, and it definitely met my expectations! The story of whiskey and the different families that were producing it in Dublin is really interesting. The guide I had on my tour was amazing, not only he explained everything so perfectly but he also was extremely fun and entertaining! The final tasting is really good and it lets you understand different whiskey flavours and types better. Its definitely a nice museum to visit upon your arrival in Ireland. It doesnt really have any artifacts, but the tour guides are awesome. They keep this museum alive with their strong storytelling skills. I would say that the price is reasonable if you consider tasting 3 small-medium whiskey portions and  that Fercullen (top left bottle) is quite expensive. Definitely visit it if you have time. Was a great tour with the overall history of Irish whiskey, the whiskey tax, prohibition and the comeback. Tour starts with a history video then takes you through several historical periods before tasting. I paid for the premium tour that came with four whiskey samples and a souvenir whiskey glass. Whiskey for sampling is dependent on their sponsors at the time. Our guide was personable and it was a great time. I suggest the Writer s Tears if it is available. My father and I had our very first trip to Ireland, and the Irish Whiskey Museum was something we wanted to do while in Dublin. We scheduled the Irish Whiskey Museum blending tour for the day we arrived and were not disappointed.  It was a fun experience, and our tour host/guide Darragh was great at his job. He definitely deserves to be acknowledged for his exuberance and wit. He was very fun to talk with and gave a great tour, history, and overview of the whiskeys you taste and blend. What a great way to start our memorable first trip to Ireland. I definitely recommend this if you have time and enjoy Irish Whiskey. I dont know why I took a picture of the crapper at the Irish Whiskey Museum, but I thought I would add it anyway. We enjoyed the Whiskey Museum tour and tasting experience. Braian was both knowledgeable and entertaining. He personalized the tour for individuals from different parts of the world and their level of knowledge. Visited the museum over the May bank holiday. Great experience and Stuart the guide a wonderfully entertaining performance. He was very good at explaining the origins of Whiskey. Then you get to blend some whiskey. That was nice. Learned some interesting facts about how whiskey got its name and the difference colours and tastes. Great experience of the museum. The guide provided great insights and historical context with a great sense of humor throughout the tour which lasts about 30 mins. and ends with a whisky tasting at the bar on the top floor. Definitely recommend to do this one in addition to Guinness and Jameson tours if you wanna know about some locally popular whiskies as well. We did the blending experience at the Irish Whiskey Museum. Highly recommend this activity - Mathew was fun, friendly and super  knowledgeable. The best part was taking home a unique blend of whiskey made ourselves to cherish! The only recommendation for future activities- please provide water with the whiskey or in the email with the tickets, ask everyone to bring water along - definitely needed hydration! This is a must-do if you are visiting Dublin. Its a great overall introduction to Irelands whiskey history and you get to sample some amazing whiskey as well. Afterwards, they have a quaint bar where you can have more whiskey or savor a pint of Guinness. Overall, we had a wonderful experience here. Our experience with Lydia was by far and away our best experience in Ireland. She did absolutely amazing at presenting the facts, keeping our attention, and making the experience so fun. I truly think she loves her work at the Irish Whiskey Museum and know that she will provide the best experience to all of her customers. She is so personable and really thrives at getting her audience to engage and taking a personal approach to getting to know her tourists. If youre planning a trip to Dublin the Irish Whiskey Museum is a MUST! A quick hour was super fun! Learned the history of the Irish distillers and ended with a sampling. We paid the extra for the 4th sample...glad we did! All fantastic spirits. Our guide Ben was really funny adding to the tour. Souvenir shot glass is of high quality, fun little take home.  Great location near temple bar, lots of transportation. Tickets are easy to get in advance. We had a very nice experience. The storytelling is great, learned quite some new things. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and had a good sense of humour (Callem was his name I think). Colm was not only informative, but he was hilarious! My family and I had a wonderful time learning all about Whiskey. So glad we decided to pop in! Amazing experience! We enjoyed every moment spent with our host - the best story teller   I discovered how to taste the flavors, first time when I enjoyed whiskey   thank you Dublin Fantastic place and the guide was an excellent storyteller, with great background knowledge both regarding the history behind the whiskey and whiskey in general, brands and origins Great place to visit. The tour is entertaining and informative, get a few whiskeys at the end. The little bar is reasonably stocked and while the shop is more expensive than the off-licence, its not by a lot. The tour isnt long but paired with a visit to a nearby pub or restaurant and youll have a great day out. If youre in to whiskey, its a great little tour and recommend it. Great little spot. Went in on a whim and was very pleased we did. The bar upstairs has an excellent selection of whiskey at pretty decent prices. Staff were super friendly, I had the full house flight which was great. The tour was well done and interesting, our guide was excellent and made the tour interesting and fun. I would recommend it to anyone if you are in the area. You can do a non-alcoholic version of the tour, they have a good Irish Coffee too. Simply incredible: Im not particularly a big fan of whiskey but its an incredible experience. The staff was welcoming and knowledgeable, ready to answer any questions. Ben is a great guide and offers a captivating insight into the rich and (surprisingly) complex history of whisky. The tasting at the end of the tour was of course the highlight. We were able to taste a selection of Irish whiskeys, each with their own nuances and characteristics. Amazing place to visit. Our tour guide Matthew was hilarious and very informative. Our tour delved into the history of whiskey (Uisce beathe), how it was made, its role in small social gatherings, why whiskey is aged, and how the Irish Whiskey companies developed. The premium whiskey tasting was exciting as you try four very different flavours of whiskey, with guidance on tasting etiquette and how to make the most of each whiskey. Definitely worth a visit. The staff are extremely friendly and make your tour group feel very welcome, especially experiencing and learning about Irish culture. We did not tour the museum but we did the master class in Irish coffee, and for  20 it was well worth it are instructor had many great stories and we made an excellent Irish coffee, and being that it was early April it was comforting when it was a little chilly and wet outsid The tour guide was very nice and he explained to us each and every step for the preparation of whisky. I expected that there would be more options for whisky tasting but there were only 3 options in the classic package. The overall experience was good. I would personally recommend that you first visit the Guinness and the Jameson distillery and after that if you have time available then do visit this place. Cheers A friend of ours in Dublin recommended this Irish Whiskey Museum tour & tasting over some of the other options in the city and I m glad we listened! This was such a fun and great experience and we learned so much about the general history of Irish Whiskey instead of just one specific brand. The rooms were an immersive experience which made it so much fun! Our tour guide Ben was a hoot. Such a fun tour! Very interactive and informative. My tour was hosted by Colm (pronounced Collum) but it s Irish so        I joke but he was really cool and really good. The tour was  23 and came with three whiskey tastings at the end. Very worth it. We had a fantastic visit to the Irish Whiskey museum in Dublin!!  Our guide Colm was knowledgeable and so engaging. We highly recommend this experience! The narrator/tour-guide was very nice and funny, It takes around 2 hours to know the whole story of the Irish whiskey, don t expect to see many things as it is more about the story telling, You get to test whiskey by the end of the tour and that depends on the price of ticket you buy! If you don t drink buy the cheapest one because the price depends on how many drinks you get! Was a lot of silly, lighthearted fun. Dad jokes and family friendly vibe. Wouldn t be so good if you already knew about whiskey. Our guide Ben rocked. He had good comedic timing and high energy. Im sure that s hard to keep up with this job. We booked our tour weeks in advance and were totally looking forward to it.  We arrived and found that a large group of people had been added to our group. This group was made up of somewhere around 25 people who had been drinking a lot already.  I want to say the tour guide was great. He was knowledgeable and very funny.  The problem was we could barely hear anything he said because the people in the large group were very loud and obnoxious.  We are not uptight people and love to have fun but we were pushed to the back of the room and all the normal seats were taken up and the guide had to find stools so the few of us could have seating.   He knew we were annoyed to say the least but no type of compensation or apology was given.  I can t recommend this company at all.  I guess catering to a huge group of rude customers was their priority. It was nothing like we had heard about on reviews. Very disappointing. Tour guide was great and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of whiskey. Be ready to listen to a proper talk about the history of whiskey. Your got more interesting once the actual whiskey tasting got underway Visited on Weekend really good introduction to whiskey if you dont know much. the guide was enthusiastic and very charismatic, go for premium so you get the extra whiskey which my husband says was worth it. Absolutely brilliant and fun experience full of laughs and genuinely interesting information. Would recommend to anyone who loves a whiskey and a laugh. Our guide Matthew was witty and would help with any questions we had. We had the blending ticket and it was very fun and helpful learning about the different whiskeys. 5/5 Had a great time and a great experience at the Irish Whiskey museum. Our guide Brian was fantastic and very knowledgeable. Not to mention he was hilarious. We learned a lot about whiskey and its history. We ended up bringing home a couple bottles that we tested because we loved it so much. There is also a little bar there where you can sit and have a dram while you wait for your tour to begin. Or you can have a drink afterwards like we did. My only complaint is it is kid friendly, unfortunately, and there were two toddlers there that were extremely distracting and made the experience a little less enjoyable. So be aware of that. Also I suggest booking tickets online ahead of time since it is popular. Tour was informative and entertaining to understand the journey of Irish whiskey throughout time. Keith was friendly, very clear and even gave us some suggestions at the end so we could get a gift for a friend. Learn the true place where Whiskey was invented!! A wonderful tour aided by the superb tour guide who gave great advice and history. Well recommended... Interesting and intriguing museum about Irish whiskey. complex if you dont speak the language. but useful if you manage to understand it or follow the step even a little. Accesible price. wide variety of tests. safety pin Keith was fantastic. Visiting from Dublin as locals we weren t sure we would enjoy it as much as a tourist, but it was fascinating and he was so knowledgeable. 5 stars. Well done guys, awesome experience. I believe we had Andrew, and it was amazing. It was very informative and a very interactive activity. If you have to compare it to the Jameson one, I would pick this one 100 times over. Highly recommended. Dont miss it! Andrew, you were great; I couldnt have asked for a better guide. Absolutely fabulous time, Dave our tour guide was very enthusiastic, energetic and wonderful. He kept us entertained throughout the experience and as an Irish woman, I was surprised to learn interesting new facts. Would highly recommend!!! Visited on Honestly one of the best things we did while in Dublin. Our guide, Dolan, was one of the most hilarious humans and did a great job explaining whiskey history! Gift shop was also cute and every employee we passed were so sweet. Highly recommend!"
103,James Connolly Memorial,4.475,"Beautiful bronze statue of iconic Irish Revolution Marxist Socialist. May he rest in power and workers of the world unite for a united Ireland and a liberated Palestine. This statue is a memory to James Connolly, the early 20th century Irish nationalist politician and socialist leader. Sadly he was executed for his role in the the Easter Uprising despite the fact that we was so badly injured that he wouldve died of his injuries anyway. The statue is situated by Butt Bridge, near Gardiner Street Lower. The bronze, life-sized statue shows James Connolly standing contemplatively looking into the distance. Behind the statue, a curved wall holds communist motifs of a bronze plough and stars. If you are interest in history this is without doubt a 5 star attraction. As James Connolly, the greatest Marxist and socialist thinker, organiser and leader Ireland ever produced, was a great internationalist and anti-imperialist writer and campaigner this memorial attracts many visitors all year round. Unfortunately because of its location and traffic flow issues this can be a awkward location to get to   make sure to use the pedestrian lights if you are crossing the street. Great memorial to a Great Irish patriot. Ireland s most famous socialist, James Connolly (1868-1916), is depicted proudly in front of the plough and stars of his Irish Citizen Army. An influential organiser for workers rights, his role in the Easter Rising cemented his legacy, with his particularly cruel execution helping to fan the flames of Irish independence. Born in Edinburgh, June 5th, 1868, Connolly first went to Ireland as a fourteen year old member of the British Army. He married in Scotland where he became involved in Socialism. In 1896 he moved to Dublin where he founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party and also started a newspaper the Workers  Republic. He spent seven years in America where he lectured and organized. He was an organizer for the Wobblies in the New York area. Connolly returned to Ireland in 1910 and campaigned for the Socialist Party. Jim Larkin appointed him as Ulster Organiser for the ITGWU in Belfast but in 1913 he came back to Dublin to help during the Lockout. Connolly was one of the founders of the Irish Citizen Army. Throughout his life he wrote and published extensively on Irish and socialist issues. Tom Clarke was always sure to include Connolly and the ICA in any IRB or Volunteer celebrations, e.g. Rossa s funeral in 1915 or the Wolfe Tone commemoration. During the Easter Rising he was appointed Commandant-General of the Dublin brigade, directing the Army of the Irish Republic in the GPO. Badly wounded in two separate incidents Connolly was executed strapped to a chair on 12th May 1916. Having fun right there Its ok good statue a little bit of history of Dublin if your passing have a look (informative) Lovely commemoration but could do with a power wash. Great statue of a great man hidden behind a lamp post under a bridge. Another statue in the city which is nearby the train railroad. Can be seen on the way to Paddys Palace The hero of the working man in Ireland. Fantastic experience just a cross from liberty hall and the bus to Tayto park.. Very beautiful statue, a bit difficult to get. Very interesting stop in a history tour of dublin Nice statue and coole place. A hero if ever there was one Some beautiful buildings Lovely view! A real part of Dublin Good monument Shed a tear La causa obrera es la causa de Irlanda, la causa de irlanda es la clase obrera. Una pena que este monumento a Connelly este tan escondido. 1996                                                        ,                                                      ,                                            .                                                             ,                                                ,                              ,                                                    : <<           -               / The                -            >>.

104,James Joyce Centre,4.6,"A quirky little museum! It was quite small but fans of James Joyce (especially Ulysses) will enjoy it. It was a little hectic when I visited because they were preparing for Bloomsday but overall the staff were kind and friendly. They had a few interesting books and journals about James Joyce in the store too! (As well as some free books in the entrance hallway.) Really cool and well-put together exhibition following James Joyce s life and his experience with Ulysses. They focus on the women that made him who he is as well as his craft and his living situations throughout his life excellent. I had a great time here! Adult - 7 Student - 5 A museum well organized with a great guide! Representing the Ulysses story very well, with virtual original objects! Very friendly and welcoming. Cant wait to come back. A must-visit for anyone interested in James Joyce, Ulysses, or Dublin. Absolutely wonderful place and seriously giving instructive as insightful a glimpse of this literary giant Located in the house where James Joyce wrote Ulysses, this place is steeped in the authors memory. The rich decoration as well as the numerous conferences perpetuate the memory of the man who was one of the greatest innovators of 20th century literature. An essential stopping-off point for Joyce enthusiasts, and those who just want to find out more. The Centre organises walking tours and Joyce-related events. Dont miss the original front door of no 7 Eccles St, the most famous address in literature. (And I am including The Stable, Bethlehem, here, AND 121b Baker St, London.) I bought a ticket for Leopold Blooms footsteps Walktour (The walk tours are only on Fridays and includes the entrance to the centre). The tour through the city was very fun and the guide, Leslie, was amazing, on every step he read and sometimes acted some lines from Ulysses. Take in consideration that the tour lasts more than 2 hours, and finishes on the national library of Ireland. This is an absolute treasure if you have an interest in James Joyce, his literature, and the history of Dublin. I also recommend it to anyone who may not be as familiar with Joyce, but are curious about Joyce and his art. My recent visit to Dublin coincided with Joyces birthday, and the James Joyce Centre was one of the highlights of my trip. The two walking tours they currently offer (I participated in both) are wonderful ways to bring Joyces art to life, following in the footsteps of Joyces childhood and characters from his stories. These tours are certain to add incredible depth to anyones next reading of Joyces works. The tours are led by passionate, knowledgable, and fun guides. The Centre itself features multiple quality exhibits focusing on Joyces life and literature. The courtyard out back features the door from 7 Eccles St as well as an impressive mural representing the episodes of Ulysses in vivid images and quotations. But the real strength of the Centre are the people I met and spoke with about Joyce and his art. The staff were welcoming, happy to share their knowledge and eager to help with any questions. Ill definitely visit again when I return to Dublin, and will keep an eye on their website for upcoming events. The centre is situated in a restored 18th-century Georgian townhouse at 35 North Great Georges Street, Dublin, dating from a time when north inner city Dublin was at the height of its grandeur. It was previously owned by the Earl of Kenmare, and a Denis Maginni, who was featured in Ulysses. On permanent exhibit is furniture from Paul Leons apartment in Paris, where Joyce wrote much of Finnegans Wake, and the door to the home of Leopold Bloom and his wife, Molly, number 7 Eccles Street, one of the more famous addresses in literature, which had been rescued from demolition by John Ryan. We went on the Ulysses tour with Josh. Super informative and interesting especially after having read the book several times. I was surprised how Joyce described particular spots and places in the city so close together. You don t get that spatial aspect through the words by themselves. Very interesting. James Joyce certainly never set foot in this magnificent Georgian residence. But, thanks to the grace of many enthusiasts, starting with its director, the place constitutes a perfect tribute. My favorite part, saving the door to 7 Eccles Street where the fictional hero of the novel Ulysses, Leopold Bloom, lived. I have just written that Joyce would never have entered here, it is probable, but he had been a student for several years at the prestigious Belvedere Jesuit high school, just a stones throw away. Were Italians in holiday in Ireland,we wanted to visit this Museum and the two people that gave US the tickets were very nice, there Is even a souvenir market at the end. It was a very good experience One of my favourite place, the piano was open and we could play ! On the second floor, there was a old phone and we took pics with it !! Great place about James Joyce and his world. The house and the pieces of art are really beautiful. Thanks for the bookmark! :) the French family I came here and went through a few floors dedicated to Joyce including many historic and contemporary exhibits. Much of the exhibits are focused around Uylesses in particular and if you havent read it then you cant appreciate the museum well. I went through everything in about an hour. Nice location in an historic house in central Dublin. Link to Joyce is somewhat tenuous as it was apparently owned by an acquaintance and he visited a few times. Some rooms had interesting exhibits and explanations of his works especially Ulysses. Others were meeting/lecture rooms. I enjoyed it but this is probably one for Joyce diehards. Highly recommend the Saturday guided walk. Shout out to Josh, who is both knowledgeable and eloquent as well as being open to all manner of questions from those less immersed in the material.  The tour covers not just Joyce and Ulysses but also a good deal of Irish / Dublin history. Beautiful building and details inside. Reception staff on the other hand did not seem very friendly when we arrived and there was little to no communication towards us when we arrived other than checking into booking. He just asked if we were okay and I explained we had a booking and that it was our first time there. He looked at the confirmation and told us to just go ahead. Other than that we were not given any kind of information in regards to the museum So nice to return there after Bloomsday 2018. This time, we did the 2-hour  Introducing Joyce s Dublin  walking tour. We loved it and the tour guide was awesome: really nice and knowledgeable about Joyce. Recommended! My wife and I took Joyces Dublin tour. I studied literature and specialized in modernist literature, so I was very fascinated. Both of us absolutely loved it and found Dr. Josh Newman, our guide, to be very knowledgeable and engaging. Whether you just want to learn more about Dublin or are also into Joyces literary career, this is a tour you wont want to miss! Its a great place to visit. Apart from the wonderful exhibitions and the explanation of the chapters in Ulysses which i very much needed   the building itself is glorious. Its a hidden gem Overview of James Joyce timeline. Three presentations. Very interesting. Spent about 45 minutes, 5 Went on a Joyce Walk with Les who was fantastic. He was passionate about Joyce and passionate about the city of Dublin.  It was exciting to see some of the real life places described in Joyces works along with some of the local history that influenced him. Beautiful little venue for an intimate gathering I love going to local author museums when I travel to new places, and this one is one of my new favorites. I loved that it melded the life of James Joyce with pieces of art that carried his legacy on. In truth, Ulysses was not my favorite when I read it in college, but I ve always loved the earnest nature of Dubliners. I found myself wanting to actually finish Ulysses, and to read Dubliners once again to immerse in the art and history of the museum. Such a special place, and definitely one of our favorite stops in Dublin! I went for a special event. A talk with the editor of Joyce and the law the place its lovely. Have not taken their tour as if yet. Nice exhibition on two floors, including audio guide. Takes about an hour. Good intro to James Joyce. Participated in one of the walking tours about Ulysses Lestrygonians with the tour guide Josh. We really enjoyed walking the city through James Joyces eyes. Interesting place to kill 30-40 minutes. More of an arts/cultural space than a Joyce museum but had some interesting displays on Joyce nonetheless Had expected more info about all Joyces works. It focuses too much on Ulysses instead, which is understandable but Joyce literature isnt just that. Exhibition, though, was worth the visit, with up to three audiovisual documentaries on different topics and the possibility of watching an Ulysess movie. Interactive resources throughout the museum will give you a deep insight into his life. Bear in mind it could take around two hours or more to get through all the contents. All in all I found it very interesting and will definitely come back in my next trip to Dublin. Beautiful building. Detailed history of some of his works. Stopped short of overloading visitors with information. Wonderful and knowledgeable staff. This is an Outstanding visit for those who love Joyce, particularly for those who love Ulysses. It is authentic, well done, informative and the staff are outstanding. If you fit the criteria, you MUST spend time here. Many, if not most, people have not read Ulysses and do not know Joyce or appreciate him If you fall in this group, you may not enjoy your visit, and you probably will not appreciate the Joyce Center as much as you might. But learn to read Joyce, start with some of his easier works, then Ulysses. Its all about the filmstrips. The exhibits are not that extensive or informative. The interactive computer stations are hard to use and only one person can use them at a time. But take the time to view both films, and the museum is well worth the admission no matter much you have read of Joyce. Nice experience during the James joyce festival, the museum had a small patio outside that will allow to take a break after your visit. You can find a reconstitution of James Joyce room upstairs and his death mask It does what it says on the tin: a centre dedicated to James Joyce, his life and his works. It probably helps if you already come with a certain level of understanding about the author and are somewhat familiar with his works as this will make the visit so much more immersive. Staff is very friendly and informative if you have any extra questions and they do offer a complimentary audio guide (that I didnt avail of). The Footsteps of Leopold Bloom walk was outstanding. Our guide was James and he brought great insight to the novel that most (all?) of us missed when we read Ulysses (if ever). This is a must do while here. At least read a bit about Ulysses beforehand. The exhibition was a bit bare, there is some information and an exhibition that takes you through Ulysses, but everything felt a bit lacking and souless. Possibly better to go there for an event or something. This Victorian building, restored ,as much as possible in the manner of its time, is now the functioning heart of James Joyce culture in Dublin. Restored by a group led by the late Ken Monaghan,  a nephew of Joyce, the Centre hosts cultural and literary events around the great writer and his works. These include walks around areas relevant to Joyces novel Ulysses, talks and lectures Look around the centre, and its easy to see Stephen Dedalus brought to life there. The James Joyce Centre is a great way not only to bring Joyces stories from a new perspective, but also a fantastic way of learning more about Joyce as an artist and as a writer - and where better to do that than here?!"
105,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,4.9,"This is a must-visit place to learn all about whisky and its fascinating production process. Its incredibly easy to understand the intricacies and smell the distinct differences during the tour. We enjoyed some excellent Irish whisky shots and special cocktails too. The Jameson whisky tour was informative yet relaxed. Its definitely a great spot to explore and indulge in the world of whisky. Such a fantastic experience at the distillery last week. We had the absolute pleasure of being guided by Alexandra - 1000% made to be a tour guide!! Such passion, such history, and the tasting elements were so interesting. We opted for the additional cask draw along with the tour and this was SUCH a good addition. Highly recommend! A really great Irish whiskey tour in Dublin! We enjoyed the  basic  one hour program with an introduction to the drink distillation of Irish whiskey, the history of Jameson, and the taste testing of 3 different whiskeys. We were greeted with a welcome drink, and then our guide led us through the rest! Our experience was very good, and we learned a lot about the local whiskeys and how they are different. At the end, we walked through the gift shop and perused all of the different items available as well as the different whiskeys for sale. I would definitely recommend this experience for anyone that is a whiskey fan, or even not a whiskey fan, and we will recommend it to others! Great tour! We mixed our own 50ml bottle (size of a nip). We were provided with a really nice leather apron (which I wish I could have taken home  ) to wear while mixing our blend. Our guide was very knowledgeable, relatable and passionate about whiskey. There were only 4 people in our mixing class which was the perfect size. Everyone seemed happy with their blend since you are making it to your satisfaction. I didnt taste mine because I dont drink but I went for the experience. So people that dont drink can still enjoy this experience. I was able to mix my blend based on the aroma of the different whiskeys. You also take home a small notebook and pencil that you use during the class to write down the blends you want to mix. We did the general tasting tour. The place is amazing with an interesting history. We got to learn about how Jameson is made and got to try three different kinds of whiskey. The crested was the best of the three. The black barrel was also excellent. Great historical tour. We need to come back and take the classes. Make sure to check out the cat in the rafters. This experience surprised me in a positive way and surpassed my expectations. I am not a Jameson drinker but I really enjoyed the way they do the tour. Plenty of tasting and they make you feel welcomed. Our guide was great. He was informative , knowledgeable, lighthearted, and entertaining. Would recommend 10/10 Great tour and explanation of how one of the worlds most famous whiskeys is made and the history behind it. You dont get to tour the distillery on the tour but the go through the history, the distilling process, and end it off with a tasting of their 3 most famous whiskeys. The tour guide was excellent and made it a very entertaining experience. We did the cocktail class it was really good fun. Our guide Paul brought us through how to make 3 cocktails 2 of which we made ourselves. The flavours, ingredients and whiskey choices were explained really well. After we had made our cocktails (about an hour) we went to a private area of the bar to enjoy them and they served our 3rd cocktail. We also got a book with loads of whiskey based cocktail recipes. We thought it was really good value for what you got  60 for a taster shot of whiskey, 3 cocktails (4 as there was extra of the last one!) and the cocktail book. I would definitely recommend the experience. Note though that as you are consuming a decent amount of alcohol on this experience they wont let you do the cask draw after doing this one! I visited Jameson for the first time in 2014 and the experience improved even more. The interactive presentation and the knowledge given to us by the Guide make this experience a must-do in Dublin. The tests are fantastic and the atmosphere is fantastic. The staff was always very helpful and cheerful. We ended up buying two Jameson references that dont exist in our country. Fantastic! I highly recommend this experience! This is an iconic distillery! It has the most unique architecture, the nicest hosts and staff. Their tour is quite intriguing as they walk you through the practical steps of their process. It is built in a very beautiful corner of the city. An absolute must for whiskey connoisseurs and amateurs alike. We took the Jameson Black Barrel Blending Class and we won t soon forget this experience. I wanted to do something memorable and interactive, the inclusion of alcohol was a plus. This Class included a very informative tour of the Bow Street Jameson location and an overview about the Jameson whiskey making process. I felt like I was watching a documentary full of detailed information and a lot of Irish charm. Our group was made up of only 5 people making for a personal and intimate experience. Based on ticket availability online it looks like this class would only ever have a maximum of 14 people making it a nice departure from larger tours offered in Dublin. Our guide/Jameson Whiskey Expert was very engaging and kept things light. As part of this class you re able to blend and of course try, various Jameson whiskeys and learn all about what goes into the Jameson process. I won t spoil anything but this is something that you must do if you find yourself in Dublin for any length of time. Additionally, I would recommend the engrave-able Jameson flask from the Bow Street Market. The flask itself is 25 euro and for only 5 additional euro you can get it engraved with up to 20 characters including spaces. This is an amazing souvenir and my husband is already excited to fill his up with Jameson. The Bow Street Experience tour is very interesting split into three parts covering the history of the brand and the factory, the production process and finally a guided tasting. After the tour you have a token for a free drink in the main Grog Bar. Which is itself a very nice bar... Look up at the chandeliers. Our guide Joe was very engaging. Nice gift shop too. Cocktail making class! Great if not the best option to choose from the different activities. Worth booking in advance as there s not always availability. Good fun with great atmosphere! Reduced groups of max 16 people, the activity allows you to make 2 cocktails from scratch with guidance from an expert cocktail maker. Starting with a whiskey tasting the class followed with the details, ingredients and instructions of two different cocktails (changing depending on the season) and ends the session with a third drink on a private area of the distillery prepared by the instructor. Great option for any occasion from a family event to a friend gathering. Price per person at the time of visit was 60 . Further details can be found on the official site website. Great experience, the basic tasting is a great deal, includes the post experience drink and a nice variety of cocktail options at the end. We went in the slow season, during winter and it was really quiet which made it even better. Took our time and only had a handful of people in our tasting. Loved learning the history, its not as extravagant as say Guinness, but its much more educational and interesting. I did the Standard Bow Street Experience your which includes a drink on arrival to take with you on the 40+ min tour, learning about the history of Jameson, how the famous whiskey is made and whiskey taste testing. Molly our guide was very nice and informative. Really enjoyed it. Definitely recommend it. If you visit Dublin, you MUST come here.  There were many great sites on our trip but this was one of the most memorable and in no small part due to our guide, Molly. I will confess to have never in my life having tried Jameson but we were told this tour was worth it.  The history behind this incredible Irish Whiskey is fascinating.  Even if you dont drink alcohol at all, you will be captivated by the story of Jameson. We did not have reservations but we just walked up and were able to get tour tickets and the start it off right by giving you a drink to have on the tour.  And at the end, there is a gift shop with some very quality T-shirts... and Irish Whiskey too (of course). Ive had whiskey back home in the states and we tried whiskey on Scotland but there is no question that Jameson is my number one choice.  Again, even if you dont drink, you will enjoy the tour (especially is Molly is your guide).  Im sure all the other guides are as knowledgeable, but Molly sure knew how to get the group engaged and made the tour such a fun and memorable experience. We did the standard tour and cask draw add-on here and had a great time. Our tour guide, Erin, made it though. She was super awesome and kept us all laughing throughout. I really enjoyed at the beginning she had us all say where we were from and kept engaging with all of us so it didn t feel like a normal run of the mill tour. While you don t see the inner working of a factory, I felt like I did learn a lot. The cask draw was totally worth it in my opinion. They bring you inside a room that is full of whisky barrels and pull it straight up from one of them for you to try. The taste was so different than the bottled versions with it being extra burning and warmed your chest, very cool. This was an interesting tour. We received a lot of information about the distillery,  its owner, its history, and best of all we received one free cocktail,  plus got to taste 3 whiskeys. Overall it was a worthwhile experience. you must come here and do a tour if youre in dublin! we had an amazing tour guide (ronnie) who made the experience so good. the history and process of making the whiskey was absolutely fascinating and we loved every minute. you get to sample 3 whiskies before getting your grog (free drink) at the end of your visit. The gift shop is big with a lot of items such as hoodies, t-shirts, hats, posters etc. cant recommend enough! We had the basic tour, which was lead by our excellent guide James. He was very enthusiastic and passionate about the history of not only Jamesons whisky but also Ireland. My boyfriend and I went to Jamesons yesterday and we had a great great time, were home visiting family and to celebrate St Paddys day.... the staff were really great, we got to chat properly with Margaret, in the gift shop, really knowledgeable and friendly and of course our guide Leah was just fantastic.... another lovely girl in the gift shop who helped us with tax back, as hes from America, sorry I didnt get her name, we started with delicious old fashioned cocktails, 12  each, then we did the 45 minute tour, we booked online 30  each, it included a complimentary drink, choice of Jameson neat, or with lemonade or with ginger ale. You were able to bring this on the tour instead of rushing...... the tour itself included tasting of Jameson distillery blend, Crested Jameson and Black Barrel Jameson, it was a great experience and I will definitely go back and try one of the other tours another day..... well done Jameson x We came here and did the Bow St Experience followed by the Cask Draw which were two incredible experiences. The tour was fantastic (Alex was our tour guide and she was incredibly fun and informative) and the Cask Draw was such a unique experience where we got to try a 21 year whiskey straight from the barrel. Niall talked us through that process and gave us so much information about the whiskey. The experience is immeasurably better than the Guinness Storehouse and is very interactive, a must visit in Dublin! If you re visiting Dublin and you enjoy Irish whiskey this is without a doubt the crown jewel. The tour was perfectly organized, The staff was extremely friendly, and of course, the product was outstanding. They have an awesome gift shop, as well as the ability to buy many delectable versions of their product. Not to be missed Wonderful place with a history of Irish whiskey traditions, story of discovery and development, all about the process and taste of this drink. 45 min tour - 33 euro, you taste 3 types of Jameson plus free drink       There are people from all over the world! And our guide Lisa - the best Our tour guide was knowledgeable and very entertaining. He made the experience wholly worthwhile. Learned a lot about the extraordinary history of this place. There was a free choice of a full Jameson drink at the end of the tour to be enjoyed at a most beautiful bar. The only disappointment was my expectation that this was a working distillery. It is not. Totally worth paying a visit. A must-see when visiting Dublin! The tour gave amazing insight not only into Jameson, but Dublin as a whole. This experience was well worth it for the unique variety of tastings alone! Our tour guide was amazing, answering so many of our questions! I loved the experience and it was absolutely wonderful! You should visit if you re around , especially if you are an whiskey lover Visited in 2022. This is a must if you are a fan of Jameson.  The atmosphere is great as soon as you walk in.  Cool bar right when you enter where they have very good cocktails.  Their gift shop is great, lots of cool items that will make great gifts. They even have a few bottles that are exclusive to the Guinness store that you can personalize with your name on the label. We did the tour and the guide was amazing!  He was so good at keeping everyone engaged and the content of the tour was really entertaining.  We paid extra to taste from a cask that they tap open in front of you.  This is something they do not bottle for sale.  Overall, highly recommend it! P.S. I heard from a local in Dublin that he had gone on a tour awhile back and it wasn t good but they had updated the tour a few years back and he had gone back as well and was much better. So if you had gone awhile ago and was disappointed, try again! Book ahead of time! A great tour for me and the kids (14 & 16) Alex was a great guide, and she explained the process really well. It was interesting enough for the kids, and the whiskey tasting was a great way to end the tour. Well worth a visit! I visited 3 whiskey distilleries in Ireland and Jameson had the best experience of any of them, and was one of my favorite things we did in Dublin. The tour was very well put together (and Nial was an excellent guide). The add on cask draw was also cool. The bar there was also really good. In addition to their normal cocktail menu they had a whole old fashioned menu, we tried 3 of them and all were delicious. I would also recommend the bottle your own black barrel option to any whiskey fans. Great experience and one of my favorite things to do in Dublin! I did the tour, which taught me a lot about history, whisky, and especially Jameson! The guide was also very energetic and made my time there a great time. Make sure to also check out the grog bar, where you can get amazing drinks in a great atmosphere! The tour was a great experience, although its not the Jameson distillery anymore its a great place to learn their history, how Jameson whisky is made and how to taste it! The best part was our ambassador, a great Irish guy who was so passionate and made us feel the same passion about Jameson whisky and this part of Irish tradition. MAY YOUR GLASS BE EVER FULL!! Had a great time at the Jameson Experience! Katie was an excellent brand ambassador and made the whole experience so much better. Definitely a must do when visiting Dublin! Really enjoyed this tour. Alex the tour guide was really knowledgeable, had a great personality and made it both informative and entertaining. The interactive aspects also made it stand out from other tours Ive been on. Fully recommend this to anyone. Wonderful tour. Im not a whisky drinker usually but my husband is. Yet I loved the tour and found a whisky I enjoyed. Well worth a booking and tour, thanks! Such a great experience! Quite interactive, while getting a lot of information. You also have the chance to taste throught the tour, as well as a drink of choice in the end. Great tour. Really good value for money and you learn loads. Our guide was Ian. Made it really entertaining. Lots of interesting bits of info. Now a Jameson Balck Barrel convert ! Visited two weeks ago, we had an amazing guide, Max, the atmosphere with the cool bar is fantastic. We tasted 3 Jameson shots and a drink at the bar was also included in the ticket. Great experience if you re whiskey fan. Top experience in Dublin learning about the history of Jameson and getting to taste all the wonderful whiskey! Our guide Robbie was super passionate and ensured we had a fantastic visit. Nice tour, very interactive and the girl (Im not sure if her name was Lucy) was really funny trying to explain everything nice. Highly recommend a visit and good price for the tour and experience."
106,Jay Kays Cafe,4.525,"They managed to get a table for 6 of us in about 10 minutes on a busy Friday, which was awesome. You know what else was awesome? The Irish Breakfast and the very friendly employees. Our party also had the avocado toast, Eggs Benedict, crepes, cheese toasty, ginger/turmeric shots, and lots of coffee, all of which was fantastic. This was a great spot to recharge and get ready for a day in Dublin. The place is good. Busy. We arrived at 9 oclock. The trust was very friendly. We got a table right away. We order. The coffee was very tasteless, bitter black water :-) I ate avocado on toast with salmon and hash browns. The food was delicious. the eggs were overcooked. And this immediately spoils the taste of breakfast. Service was great and speedy. Food was amazing and also speedy. We had the Irish breakfast and French Toast with bacon. Both were really tasty. Had an Irish latte and mango citrus smoothie which were also both really tasty. Great brunch spot. Kid-friendliness: High chairs available, happy to move chairs for prams. So went to Jays early on a Saturday morning. I had an omelette it was very nice it was the breakfast omelette a bit pricey for what I got but it was tasty. Coffee I just got a Americano to be honest not the best very bland coffee. Go for another coffee if you can. Service very quick and friendly I sat on my own felt a bit squeezed in but overall a great experience We were contemplating wether to have breakfast here or just across the pavement at at Lemon Jelly Cafe. There were queues are thr length at both places so we decided to come here as we had already been to Lemon Jelly the day before. The atmosphere was nice we were seated upstairs tucked in the corner away from the hustle and bustle. We had great service and and lovely breakfast. The Irish coffee was spot on aswel as thr chai latte. Nice place with great coffee but disappointed to find parts of the white of my egg on the breakfast club runny/raw - runny/uncooked egg white was dripping down parts of the brioche bun so dont know how the chef didnt spot this...always amazes me how chefs cannot see parts of the whites of eggs uncooked. Luckily enough, I was able to scrape the runny bits off and able to enjoy the rest of it. Other than that, the place was grand - it just requires a little more attention to detail, unfortunately. The coffee was good, the salty breakfast was also tasty. The crepes were old, definitely not made when we ordered them, they were also cold and mediocre. The staff was friendly Outstanding breakfast, best value in Dublin. Service is prompt and friendly, coffee is delicious and the food is fantastic. Arrived within ten minutes which was superb. Prices are amazing value, having almost paid  17 for a breakfast only five minutes away Im glad we didnt. One of the highlights of our trip. Woahhhhh! I love the chic calming vibe here. Service was awesome and the food was YUM! I had the overnight oats and the addition of the coconut flakes created the perfect balance of texture. I was blown away with the quality and creation of each dish we tried. I also had the unicorn tears tea which was honestly the perfect description. I would highly recommend stopping by for a bite. They have a great menu variety and I love the blue ambience of the restaurant. Coffee, fancy juice, smoothie, tea. English breakfast, crepes- sweet/savory, big/small. There is something for everyone <3 Not impressed. Pulled pork is great, Caesar very plain, the sauce seemed like great yoghurt. Very noisy so impossible to talk because of staff making smoothies. Crumbs and grease on the table. The brunch here was absolutely delicious, and the juice was simply divine! The atmosphere had a very nice vibe. However, we felt a bit ignored by the staff and were treated a bit coldly at times. Despite that, everything else was good. Jays Cafe fell short of expectations despite its 4.5-star rating and a high number of reviews. While the service was swift, the coffee left much to be desired, featuring a disagreeable sharp taste and lacking body. Disappointingly, the eggs benedict were overcooked, and the absence of sides, like fried potatoes, was notable. Additionally, the oversight of not providing condiments such as balsamic further detracted from the dining experience. The wobbly table and cramped corner seating contributed to an uncomfortable atmosphere.  Jays Cafe dining is indicative of a hospital cafeteria. Although a saving grace was found in the enjoyable Irish burrito, the overall impression suggests that Jays Cafe may be more fittingly rated as a 3 to 3.5-star establishment. It appears that certain aspects, particularly the coffee quality and attention to detail in dish presentation, did not align with the high rating and extensive praise. While individual preferences play a role, the discrepancy between expectations and reality may leave patrons seeking a more consistent and well-rounded dining experience elsewhere. Very tasty brunch food, lovely service and atmospheric space. Had the Breakfast Club sandwich and it was delicious. Could argue that drinks are a bit expensive but such is life now. Otherwise menu prices are quite reasonable in a Dublin City centre context. We had a lovely visit today. Such tasty food and they were so helpful and accommodating for my friend who is a coeliac. Gluten free options were great. The vibe was great and the staff were more than wonderful. Thanks so much! We had a nice experience all together. French toast with Chantilly cream was soft and berry compote was refreshing. Oat cappuccino has smooth taste with perfect temperature. Shakshoka was nice, bell papers cut were big which could have been cut smaller, also I had tried the same food warmer which is better. Earl grey tea could have been perfect if cup wasn t smelly. The kitchen was visible from street and the way the guy who was cleaning the teaspoons and drying them was not hygienic. I ve been coming here since the start of 2023, when I first moved to Ireland. I was always impressed with everything. Today I came here for brunch and despite them being super busy. The owner was so kind and accommodating when I wanted to move upstairs to eat. The food is delicious. I strongly recommend this establishment to my clients! I loved like always lovely place, came across it walking thru town with my friend. Staff are kind and welcoming, service is fast and food is lovely. Very reasonable pricing. My cheese toastie was  6.50 Thought this was good as in other places around town they were charging  8- 9. Place was clean and would definitely go back. Not a bad spot. Theres usually a queue out the door but we werent waiting too long and it seemed to run really well. Food was good, I had the Italian sandwich but wasnt amazing, my girlfriend had. The eggs on toast and said it was some of the best scrambled eggs shes ever had Lovely spot for breakfast/brunch. Friendly and efficient staff. We had south of France tea, a cappuccino, smoked salmon omelette and french toast. The portions looked small when they came out but they were perfect size.  Would definitely recommend. Food Nice little Cafe with plenty of space upstairs, ordered the breakfast burrito. Absolutely gorgeous, just what the doctor ordered. My wife ordered the bacon club sandwich it looked mega and tasted fantastic. Great little find, if I was to give one criticism it was that the coffee was like warm rather than hot! But that does really effect my thoughts on what a great place this is good vibes and very clean toilets. Which says a lot about a place. Totally loved this cafe . I tried the eggs Benedict . The bacon , the egg and the holandaise sauce so all just perfectly done also loved the chai latte . The staff here is also great. Thanks team Let s start with the customer service - amazing and very accommodating. But the omelette was something else Absolute delicious and fresh ingredients. If you want a good quality breakfast with superb taste, come here. Make sure you grab a coffee,their beans are really smooth. Very authentic Irish brunch place.  We ordered their half Irish breakfast which is a must when trying out authentic Irish food. We also got shashuka eggs and chessy sandwich with split pea soup. Their cappuccino was spot on. Food was fresh and portion sizes were perfect too. Highly recommend. Vegetarian options: Good veggie options Superb cafe just a few metres from the Jervis tram stop in the heart of Dublin. Stumbled upon it by accident but visited twice during our weekend trip for brunch/late breakfast. Superb food, excellent service and reasonable prices for city centre. Will 100% return. Banger of a cafe. eggs benedict were lovely bacon club was a perfect size along with the eggs benedict. the pepper and parmesan fries were so nice and crunchy along with the garlic dip. The mango smoothie had a mixture of sweet and citrus which was great too. staff were accommodating. lovely brunch! Went here for breakfast during my Dublin visit. The place is cozy and has good sitting options. The staffs are friendly. Service was quick. Ordered Omelet shakshuka. Overnight berries oats, coffee and ginger, apple, carrot, lemon juice. Food were all good and the juice was amazing. It gets busy, so better go a bit early for breakfast. I would recommend this place if you are visiting Dublin. Came here for brunch and waited in line outside for about 20mins for a table. Really enjoyed the food though. Lovely waitress- no complaints! Friendly staff. Good food. Nice atmosphere. Overall, a great place! I am just passing through Dublin, but would definitely eat here again for breakfast if I were staying longer. I like their coffee and smoothie. And the breakfast dishes that we had were tasty. Food was very delicious, only my portion of the fresh fruits with the joghurt could have been a bit bigger but thats just my opinion. Place itself is very inviting but it was a bit cold (inside!). My favourite place in Dublin for breakfast! I couldn t photograph my food because I was too excited to eat it! Absolutely delicious. The staff are so kind and accommodating! This is my recent discovery in Dublin City centre. Lovely spot for some brunch. They have a really vast menu ranging from omelettes, croissants, crepes, sandwiches and salads. They also have coffees, juices, smoothies and cocktails too! They also offer some vegetarian options on the menu. I really enjoyed the Scrambled egg and Parmesan croissant. There is loads of seating space as they have the first floor too. The interiors are nice and welcoming. Staff is quick in service and very polite. All in all a good experience, would recommend a visit here. First time trying JK cafe  after it s magnificent reputation throughout Dublin. The restaurant interior was very calm , hip and modern despite being  busy from table to table . The queue outside had showed how popular this restaurant is which is a great sign for any eatery . The food was very good . I had the Irish Breakfast , similar to an English breakfast but with some differences such as the white pudding which I had not tried before . The whole meal was perfect , very tasty ! The meat was very high quality , egg cooked very well but not a fan of the potatoes. . The service was good . I was rather unpleased by a young man that had ignored me very purposefully after asking for a table . I m not sure if it s the culture , but I m not used to a waiter being so ignorant . However , the rest of the staff were very pleasant especially the very jolly man behind the till. Food : 8/10 Service FOH : 5/10 Waiting times :6 /10 Restaurant environment: 8/10 Cleanliness : 9/10 Price : 8/10 Overall score : 7.5 Definelty recommend to come here for a brunch , would sure  revisit . I am amazed by how great the food was. We had a breakfast/lunch with my friend and loved it. I have to say, if you are planning to visit there at the weekend, you will need to wait in the queue or the best option is to get a booking! Everything including drinks were so fresh, tasty, well served. Service and cleanliness were so good too. I will be absolutely happy to back and try a few things more. Great Irish breakfast and juices. Great menu and well timed mannerly staff.  Will go again. Lovely food and AMAZING staff! We arrived when it was busy and awkwardly asked to change seats (we were initially just outside the kitchen where everyone walks by). Despite being incredibly busy, the staff member we asked was incredibly kind (I think it might have been the manager/owner). Later on, they also double checked for us on the desserts we wanted and were all very attentive throughout. So lovely! Food and coffee was lovely but everything enhanced by the wonderful customer service. Bravo! Back for sure! Food was great - had the eggs royale and was perfectly made and made surprisingly quickly after ordering. Also had a chocolate crossaint which was amazing. Coffee was ok - ordered a flat white but was not hot. Service could have been better as waiter took long to get back to us and did not bring an item we ordered. Jay Kays offers a wide choice of dishes and drinks. We had brunch there and everything was incredible. The service was efficient and the servers were friendly. Came here first thing in the morning two different days and both times the staff were extremely friendly. Food is delicious and well portioned. Everything was excellent.  We got a breakfast sandwich, smash burger, omelette, and Parmesan and egg croissant.   All were absolutely delicious!!  Highly recommend"
107,Joy of Cha,4.6,"Full of character cafe in Old city of Dublin attractions for a trandy crawd! Excellent Services from a friendly and accommodating staff! Food of great quality at reasonable price. There is always a queue waiting for seating in, shows how popular this place is with locals! Highly recommend and definitely on my come back to list This place is an absolute gem! Super tasty food and amazing service. We had breakfast here and could not recommend enough. The bagel was delicious. We always go here when in Dublin. The food is always perfect and a lovely cosy atmosphere. The latest visit was breakfast (Artisan Irish Breakfast), delicious Best Irish breakfast in town! Lovely service! You have the widest brunch menu you can wish for! Highly recommend! I had read great reviews so decided to try Joy Of Cha for breakfast last week while my mom and I were visiting Dublin. I can t say enough about the quality of the food, the atmosphere, and the incredible service. It was, hands-down, my favorite place that we ate. We loved it so much we had three out of our six breakfasts in Dublin there. My mom loved the scones and I loved the avocado toast with eggs. Their lattes are wonderful too! The staff were incredibly welcoming, and it was the best service that we received a Dublin. Highly recommend going if you are in the area! Look forward to returning and trying more of the menu! Irish smoked salmon avocado sandwich Bread was super dry toasted.  Almost like a crouton.  Cream cheese on each slice, piled atop each other with all the other fixings arranged up on top.  Plenty otoppings, creating delicious, crusty, sumptuous,  creamy feel from the mind-blowing beginning to the mournful ending (no matter how good it is there always comes an end). Mushroom Tart Warm, comforting, filling, and savory Cappuccino Great accompaniment with breakfast. Came in for a warm morning brunch and partially delivered what we were looking for. It s a small, crowds establishment that gets busy during brunch hour but servers managed to provide decent service. Ordered the scones which I adore. It had a crispy shell and soft texture. The craft breakfast was on point with crispy fried egg but we were disappointed by the bagel as it was not toasted and tad too moist perhaps from the cheese. Overall I would recommend but you can avoid the bagel. the place surprised me, the space didnt really please me, it was small and dark, but the food and service were impeccable, I was welcomed with a beautiful smile from the attendant, which made me stay in the place, the food was delicious, well thought out, I LOVED IT SO MUCH !! I highly recommend It is a small but cosy place, the attention of the girls is close and friendly, the American breakfast is AMAZING, it s in my top 3, the prices are very good for the amount of food they offer, highly recommended. Breakfast is excellent and the staff are very friendly. We arrived a little early but they allowed us to sit in and soak up the atmosphere, which is relaxing and welcoming. Kids hot chocolate was a hit. Tatty around the edges, but pros outweigh the cons. Leaving full and content. Kid-friendliness: They mellowed out the kids hot chocolate for us which was a clever thought as we had a full day ahead of us. Dont want them running around. Already like herding cats!!! Absolutely fantastic breakfast and lunch place. A hidden gem that was so cosy and comfortable after a long morning of traveling. The service was also exceptional from our waitress Silvana. Highly recommend and will come back to again on this trip. Seating was slightly limited so you might share with others at a table, but worth it! Joy of Cha came highly recommended by locals and tourists alike and this place did not disappoint! It s voted as the #1 breakfast place in Dublin for a reason. Very happy we were able to get a table here as it s always busy. Just a heads up it s a tight fit in here but well worth it! The Irish breakfast and the bacon tart and hot chocolate/white chocolate was delicious. Also the scone! Wow! We can t wait to come back to Dublin so I can eat here again. Absolutely phenomenal! The food here is rich and delicious You can come and try their food you wont be disappointed Food : 5/5 The irish breakfast is just okay - traditional, but not actually that tasty. Highly recommend place! Forget the places that advertise with best English breakfast. This is the place for your breakfast or lunch. This small Bakery/restaurant is run by a great lady l, which I think is the owner. The food is great, full of flavor and plenty! Eaten here 3 times and if we would have been here longer, we would have had our breakfast here every day. Will be back, if I am ever in Dublin again. Greetings from the 5 Dutch guys. We arrived for a coffee here in the late afternoon. Pleasant to discover the presence of tables inside in these beautifully decorated rooms. The pastries werent bad, but the cappuccino was a little insipid. pricing comparable to Templebar, attentive and courteous service Staff was very friendly, drinks arrived quickly but the food took a bit longer. It was worth the waiting, though. The bagel was beautifully cooked, the bacon was crispy and the eggs had the yolk runny, which is awesome. The traditional Irish breakfast was also well-cooked and made with very good ingredients. Would come here again because all of these items were fair-priced. A place to enjoy brunch, tea, deserts, without  instagramers  vibe, instead is a bit  retro , and cozy. Food remind me grandmother sweets, not focused on how things look like but how it tasty liked. I m not saying it s doesn t not look good, but it just look occasional, with a professionalism touch of course. Well served portions, and some customer service latin vibes and sympathy. Stopped here for cakes and Irish Coffees when in Dublins Temple Bar area. Friendly staff, fabulous homemade cakes (Raspberry Crumble Cake was divine) and a great decor and ambience. Toilet available. Some outside seating but only a couple of small tables for two. Food is lovely, great coffee, relaxing atmosphere, and above all else the establishment is very clean. This is truly is a great little cafe except for the waitress. I unfortunately found her to be quite ignorant, almost as if she didnt like serving me. However, everyone else was lovely and bubbly. The other girl working the till was very polite and manerly. I will most definitely be recommending this cafe to friends This place in temple bar area, is decorated beautifully. The lovely baristas were very friendly. Fast service with a smile. The cappuccino was one of the best I have ever had!! The apple cherry cake warmed up with powdered sugar on top, was spectacular. I highly reccemend it! I heard so much about it that I was keen on trying the breakfast. Everything ok, good but nothing exceptional. I found it a bit overrated. But well located and fast service. Perfect for a brunch in the heart of Dublin. Home cooking, generous dishes, welcoming staff. Wide choice for eating on site. Vegetarian choice available. Very nice atypical decoration. I recommend An absolute must for breakfast if youre in Dublin! The experience here was great. From the very beginning the staff was very welcoming and friendly, great atmosphere, you could smell fresh coffee at the entrance. Went there with a group of 8, the place is not big and we had no reservation, so we gratefully accepted to be seated separately. 10 mins later the staff moved us to a table for the whole group. So really appreciated their attention to detail and flexibility. Food was as great as their staff! Best Irish breakfast in Dublin! I tried different Irish breakfast versions during my time at Dublin and this was hands down the very best. Fresh ingredients for a delicious homemade, farm-to-table Irish breakfast. I just wish the beans came included with the breakfast but its great that you can order them as a side (generous portion of beans, by the way). Coffee was also perfect! Our group had cappuccinos, espressos, Irish coffees (of course, as well as a few Guinness) and they were all praising their coffees. I will definitely come back! I am just visiting Dublin and I stumbled across this JEM. This is the absolute cutest place. I had literally the best quiche of my life. All my friends food was also amazing. They also have a great tea selection and I went for the jasmine tea with honey. It was to die for. The staff was super friendly and the place just has a really chill atmosphere. If you see this you would be silly not to go. I am not very impressed by Joy of Cha. The food is fine, nothing exceptional but nothing bad. But to be fair I would expect a better. The place has got potential. It is very cosy and pleasant. Unfortunately our waitress must have been in a very bad mood and she made it obvious to us. And, even at the risk of being unfair, she ruined it completely by ignoring and not returning our good byes. And despite leaving a decent tip... Not sure I will be back soon. We visited for having the traditional Irish breakfast (vegan). The food was nice although it looked as if it was made pretty quickly (different quantities in both dishes, the eggs were almost fried, not scrumbled...). We were not so happy with the experience with one of the members of the staff though, we lost something into the local and the person we asked didnt help us at all, in fact it felt like we were disturbing, customers who were there helped us kindly though. Really great little cafe right near the Temple Bar area. Friendly staff with a good menu. Food was really tasty and the pastries and cakes to go are devine. Can get busy around the expected times and is only small, so you may have to wait a short while for a table but its worth it! The food is absolutely excellent and the staff is very friendly! Cute place to come to for breakfast! We came twice in two days because of how good it was! We recommend it 100% Great food! Had the Irish coffee and the vegetarian breakfast. Although the place is a little dark and small, the food performs perfectly. Definitely would come again Food Best breakfast weve had in Dublin.  Great coffee. Large portions.  Fantastic waiter, so good and attentive in fact that when he heard my wife drop her knife, he brought a new one without prompting.   He couldnt see it from where he stood, but heard it and did his job flawlessly. Bravo. Best breakfast in Dublin! Me and my boyfriend accidentally stumbled into this charming cafe and let me tell you we where not disappointed. The breakfast is absolutely amazing! The drinks are also on par and lovely. The cherry on top is the super kind staff. We will make sure to come back for breakfast if we are visiting Dublin again. This is definitely one of the many best places to stop and eat at. Me and my wife had breakfast and the food was delicious. Please everyone give this place a try! Good food with good price. Really enjoyed the Baileys coffee and tomato cheese croissant. Would recommend the croissant. Also the ginseng coffee was quite interesting. You can surely give a shot. Lovely vibe with a spanish decor. Based near temple bar. Good location and lovely staff. This place was so good! The pastries, cakes, and breakfast breads looked so amazing. The coffee was really amazing and the food deserves more than 5 stars. Really amazing service and the staff was so friendly. Definitely go visit!! Amazing food and amazing place. Its the first time, but no the last. Its not a big place but there are few options for take away. A very recommended spot to take a break if you are visiting temple bar. Family atmosphere, cozy, quiet. We had a great time, homemade products, wonderful Apple crumble. Copious portions and very reasonable prices. In short, you have to stop there! Food was brilliant and would come back because of that and that s also why I m giving the cafe 5 stars. Service was extremely poor, though. Nobody even seems interested in getting your order at the counter and they tried to charge us more than what was on the menu, without even acknowledging the mistake with an apology at the end. Right on a lovely street, we were drawn in with the scrumptious looking splay visible from the street. We ended up with a chorizo cheese tart to share and were not disappointed! It has been my favourite cozy cafe since I moved to Dublin in 2020, great and special food with very reasonable prices. Warm and artistic atmosphere with all kinds of decent original tea(not tea bags), it is just very relaxing to get a pot of tea in a rainy day, reading or chatting with friends. It honestly made my day."
108,KC Peaches Cafe Dame Street,4.325,"The red velvet cake and lemon bars were amazing. I knew from the first taste this was American own a change of pace from Irish food. We went back for the only decent breakfast in Dublin. I wish we had discovered it at the beginning of our trip. Just okay I guess. I ordered the KCP club that claims it has crispy bacon and received this. Mostly fat and not a hint of crispness. I took it off the sandwich because it was impossible to chew and kept getting caught in my throat. The amount of toppings doesnt really warrant a 3rd piece of bread either. But the Latte was good! Staff was friendly. There are a few of these cafes in Dublin and I highly recommend any one of them for good food. Self service salad bar and hot food bar with a huge selection to choose from. Sandwiches and soup to order, also a very large selection of juices , hot and cold drinks and sweet treats. The staff are efficient and pleasant. My coffee and veggi wrap came to  10.80 and it was delicious. Tourist trap with reheated food, rubbery toast, food looks good, but tastes bland. There were staff lounging on the sofas upstairs like slobs, legs spread wide open and on their phones. Would never go back. The  5.50 coffee and muffin combo has become a breakfast staple for me because of its great quality and value. The barista is hardworking and provides an efficient service. There is a comfortable atmosphere upstairs where you can enjoy your coffee and unwind. Such attentive staff. The options were many and the food so fresh and absolutely delicious. Lots of seating and cozy decor i highly recommend for a lunch We stopped here for a proper coffee and breakfast just before the St Patricks Day Parade in 2023. It was absolutely amazing. Next time we come to Dublin, were coming back to KC Peaches! We only ordered some drinks and service is good. The atmosphere is chill and staff were attentive. Food is delicious, can also be ordered from your table using a scaning option, and very quickly received once ordered Better care of toilet facilities is a must and needed. While there was  a lift, it appeared to be just available for staff usage/ kitchen. So, better facilities would be a must  to provide for people with limited mobility and  those who would have difficulty using the stairs. as they lose out on not being able to avail of the lovely seating area provided further on the upper levels,  as ground floor seating area, very limited and too  low too sit on Staff are very friendly,courteous, helpful, and very professional . Would definitely recommend I was a bit disappointed by the hot options available because my first experience with the brand was at their St. Stephens Green location, where theres much more variety. But the food was okay. Here, I also find the size of the containers confusing; the difference is minimal, and the large option is smaller compared to the St. Stephens Green location. I always love a good little cafeteria to grab a coffe and stay for a while with a book or my computer. This bar-cafeteria was very centric but very quiet and gave me calm vibes, I loved it. Their sandwiches were very tasty and the heart-shaped coffee was also very good. Very good experience with a cute environment. Very tasty coffee, and it s very convenient when you can put together exactly the breakfast you like, there is a vegan option for an Irish breakfast Stumbled by this place as we were on our way to our car to leave Dublin. Ordered some desserts and they were lovely. We also got the meat lasagna and it was fantastic. Guinness cake was a bit dry, but the lemon meringue tart was awesome! Food was a but pricey because it s by container, but we still enjoyed it. This seems to be a chain in Dublin. I Walked by many of them and the displays always looked really beautiful with really interesting baked goods that they were showing. Finally I had to give in and try the passion fruit and coconut tea cake. I was not disappointed. The staff are super friendly and of the tea cake itself was really moist and flavorful. I ended up getting another one to go. Great service, staff are very friendly and helpful. Food is good, and pricing is reasonable. Good variety of food. Nice upstairs area.. Lovely place and really good food Came here twice in a week to work. Lovely cafe and the food is delicious and very fairly priced. The sfaff is very welcoming and nice. I will definitely come back in the future! I had  Just peachy smoothie, flat white cup of coffee and an avocado egg toast. The representation and the service was amazing. Unfortunately the avocado was still frozen. I could not cut into the avocado itself. I would try this place again, I ll just won t get the avocado egg toast. Super cute vibe though. Fully recommend the food here! The service was also amazing, i have certain dietary restrictions due to my ibs and i could discuss with the waiter about what was smart to get etc! They also truly love making the food which is lovely to see. Definite recommend! Great location too! No complaints on the service or the vibes  it s a very cute cafe. But the hot food was seriously lacking. Ordered the full vegan and it was genuinely dreadful. The toast was bone dry and there was no option for vegan butter, which is not that hard to come by in single serve containers. The sausage was dry, the veggies were completely lacking any seasoning. The hashbrowns also just seemed to be frozen hashbrowns from a box??? My friend ordered French toast and it came out completely cold and she said it was very dry. The only saving grace is that their pastries and coffee are quite good. Their tarts are amazing and the coffee was lovely. But just maybe  beware the hot food. Nice staff and great coffee. I like the All you can eat bowl served with delicious hot food Cute and cozy fast casual eatery serving all natural, locally sourced food. Great place to grab a meal on the go or to sit for a quick bite. Offers hot and cold buffet items - you take a small, medium, or large box (or plate if youre eating in), and can fill it as you like for one set price. Corner location on a main street and floor to ceiling windows make it good for people watching. I was waiting 30 minutes for a scrambled egg and went downstairs to ask about it, the manager checked and saw that my order was left behind and asked me to wait another 5 minutes (it was another 15) He didn t even say sorry or show any concern. I worked in a restaurant before and I know that those things happen, but the way you treat the customer is what makes the difference. The girls who brought me the food was lovely and said sorry. But the manager wasn t polite at all, unfortunately cause I used to love and recommend the place. Had the full Irish breakfast and a macchiato for  13.70 on a Sunday morning. Good quality, great service! Excellent breakfast options I had the scrambled egg breakfast and the quality and taste of the eggs were excellent My daughters had the breakfast burrito and Avocado & eggs and they really enjoyed Definitely a must go for breakfast if you are in the Temple Bar area My wife had the croissant and latte The matcha latte is also a must try if you all like Matcha The best meal deal with coffee and pastry Just got a Michaels sandwich for takeaway (without tomatoes) and it was delicious. The cheese and caramelised onions were so nice. Sandwiches were made fresh and friendly staff Vegetarian options: Good few veggies options available An amazing place for lovely brunch or breakfast. The food is so so so delicious . Highly recommend  . Definitely would visit this beautiful place again This place honestly has the best hot chocolate Ive ever had in my entire life. Right in the middle of the city. Beautiful spot especially upstairs on a rainy day. Ive not been back to Dublin since November but this place has still been lingering in my mind and its the middle of May right now. No doubt about coming back to this cozy little spot when Dublin is on my itinerary. #studyspot #healthy #datenight Stopped by for breakfast. The food was Delicious, not too many choices but all is great. Amazing coffee,and nice place to chill. Enjoy! I went here early and had pancakes for breakfast. I went here yesterday and asked for pancakes but they said they only did them for breakfast until 11.30 and it was half two in the afternoon. So today I wasnt risking anything and got here for 8 am. As you can see from the photo Id nearly finished them before I remembered to take a picture for internet posterity. I needed extra maple syrup but thats my problem. Was recommended to us by our accomodation in temple bar. Very nice, would have definitely tried it as a takeaway option if going again as there seemed to be a good range of take away foods for breakfast. Had poached eggs on cabbage and mushrooms which were lovely Student discount and good view, calm place. The food was very delicious but the menu was limited, with many products out of stock and the coffee not very good. The prices are good. Vegetarian options: The full vegan breakfast  is really abundance and tasty Lovely little place selling tea, coffee, cakes and Im sure I noticed main meals, too.  Staff very friendly. I had a brilliant vegan traditional breakfast in a charming atmosphere. Suitable all day long: breakfast, coffee, lunch... Take away and sit in available! The staff is also extremely nice. Great breakfast and lunch cafe!   friendly staff, delicious food, cute cafe and reasonable prices. Vegetarian options: Great vegan and vegetarian options Nice place to grab brunch. Had their omlette, fruit salad and tropic thunder smoothie. Some nice classic tunes are played on the speakers and the upstairs is very cosy. Tropic Thunder: Banana, Pineapple, Mango, Lemon, Orange and Mint Tiny bit of a wait but the food is excellent. Food was grand after a bit of a wait. Wouldn t be rushed going back to the dame street restaurant as it s just not up to scratch with Nassau street. Staff were nice and friendly but maybe there were just not enough of them. Doesn t seem to be nowhere near as busy as Nassau street but yet a lot less organised. - Slow service - tables left dirty for half an hour - not enough cutlery or anything Nice cafe:) The matcha tea latte was delicious:). The ambiance was also very nice, quiet and its really spacious upstairs so it was easy to find seating- which is important in Dublin lol- I didn t feel rushed here so I was able to get a lot of work done on my laptop, thank you:)) I would highly recommend and I would love to come back to try more drinks and the cute Halloween cupcakes"
109,KC Peaches Cafe Nassau Street,4.15,"Great place for Breakfast. Great interior decor. Nice spacious place. I tried their Avacado and Poached Egg on Toast, and it had great flovoured cherry tomatoes, and this dish tasted very good. I have often ordered Breakfast Burrito for takeaway, and its very juicy and flavourful. Their hot chocolate was very sweet for me, but sweetness is personal opinion. This is the best KC peaches i have visited till now. It is huge and also has a huge seating capacity downstairs. Once you order food you get a number and they bring food to your table. Staff is nice and their buffet is one of the best one. Will suggest to visit this restaurant for some good food  . Their pancakes   were delicious and will also recommend their breakfast platter. Food was very yummy, great place for brekky, we came straight from the airport. Bit confusing when in there when trying to order as we werent sure how it worked and there wasnt a sign or anything as no breakfast or lunch menu, they were hidden away . But definitely recommend as a great spot The atmosphere of the place was amazing. Staff were nice too. Unfortunately, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with these cakes... The raspberry tartlet was horrible. Burned sugar. I couldnt chew it...  Whats the point of it???????The taste was horrible.!!! Red velvet was slightly better but cream was horrible. I could feel only sugar on my teeth. That was horrible. I was so disappointed. Wont come to this place again. I got breakfast, avocado and egg with americano. It was delicious but avocado was barely there. Considering 11.5  for the plate (coffee not included) portion is really small. - We got sandwiches, they were hot and we re happy about that. There was no caramelised onions, but they were very quick to offer an alternative. - staff was kind and smiley - tea & coffee were good   don t they always do the job! - padded booths are roomy and comfortable, which you won t slip off, also you can t slide around - lights are very bright, so no hiding from your enemies -  eat well live well    don t tell me what to do you re not my real dad - a bit pricey but in line with the area - cookies were big and buttery and tasty - Nelly Furtado and Vanessa Carlton, it s like 2001 all over again Had a brekkie at KC Peaches   their muffins are spot-on, not too sweet, just how I like em, crunchy outise and moist inside. The yogurt pot is good, too, refreshing without being overly sugary. And oh, dont sleep on the Irish breakfast   hearty and full of flavor. I m a sucker for sweets and their window pulled me in! We enjoyed a variety of bars and my favorite pink lemonade. The inside was so aesthetically pleasing. Very tasty food from the hot bar for a quick stop, as well as a delicious toastie if you have a little more time. Also good coffee from the cafe. We didn t try any of the cakes or pastries but they looked like quality items. Great space and food selection. The staff are really friendly and the prices are reasonable. I would recommend, might even come back for a pizza later, as they have a pizza oven! Love Tasty hot bar for lunch, reasonable prices. Also had desserts and drinks. Indoor and outdoor seating. Convenient and good value. Food was alright. But the staff at the counter was very rude and standoffish. I had asked to replace the toast with French toast and before I could say anything she blatantly refused. I then said I didn t mind paying extra which I was about to say this before she rudely cut me off. Overall she made me feel very uncomfortable even asking about anything. The meal as seen in the picture cost  18 The place is really cool. Decent coffee.. But if you are Vegan, don t waste your money on the full vegan breakfast. The  sausage  is comparable to cardboard. And the beans were cold  The processed triangle hash down was the highlight. And you can get that at McDonald s. Obviously no vegans were present to test this product before putting it out. Off to find out second breakfast place this morning. Im disappointed. We ordered pancakes with berries and scrambled eggs. Pancakes tasted as someone has put a lot of baking powder inside. Scrambled eggs were tasteless. Next we tried a croissant which was mediocre and financier which was completely cold, but good. I wished something healthy and tasty. Excellent muffin with carrot and tumeric, than a pressed juice apple, lemon and ginger. Wow! The personnel is professional, responsive and fast. Recommended. The place is nice, good juices and cookies Good selection for a hot meal, small plate is about 6.50 euros (like really small), medium plate is 8.50 euros and a latte around 3.50 euros. Okay selection to choose from, buffet style, had the lasagne and it was really good. A great place to have a chat with a friend and fill your belly while you at it. Friendly staff as well and good service. Delicious breakfast and reasonable prices... More welcome and friendly atmosphere than the average Dublin fancy cafes ... Surprisingly a selection of pastries that tastes lovely and fresh. If youre wishing for your Dubliner ordinary bun and coffee to be taken to another level, stop there and enjoy. I just wish they would open one shop in Castleknock as everything in that village is incredibly boring and overpriced. My favorite go-to spot for coffee and food in Dublin. I love everything about KC Peaches, including the decor, amazing coffee, the excellent customer service they offer - and the fact that there you can find healthy, quality food (including a salad bar and a variety of fresh smoothies) for a fair price. I had a full Irish breakfast, service was very quick and they had lots of options for drinks and food Definitely overpriced, but good! Delicious pastries and drinks, and the staff is so nice and friendly. Food Perfect place for a nice, tasty and fresh salad. Everything on my plate was delicious and effordable price (mid size 11  ). The service was fine, but let s talk about the Dubliner sandwich. Seriously, the name promised a lot, but all I got was bread slathered in mayonnaise with a single, pitiful slice of ham. And they had the audacity to charge 8 euros for this travesty? I get that rent has gone up, but charging 8 euros for a ham and cheese toastie that wasn t even pressed enough to warm the ham is just absurd. This experience made me appreciate the pre-made sandwiches you find at Tesco or Lidl. Fast service, decent amount of food options for breakfast. The employees were nice and the bathrooms, located downstairs, were not bad. Great Cafe. The food is amazing. Delicious and clean ingredients. Large with plenty of seating. Quick service. Bathrooms downstairs. Highly recommend. I went with my best friend  for a brunch, I love it. The food could be better,  there s a self service so u can try many dishes. The price was fair, the vibe of the place is so nice but its kinda deafening not cause of the song but because of the people talking so probably theres a time when is more quieter Food : 4/5 We really enjoyed our food. Our soy flat white was perfect, too. Return visit as I loved this place the last time I was in Dublin. Food was delicious,  I highly recommend the Turkey club, coffee was excellent and the staff were all on the ball and very friendly. I have marked down one star as the toilets really let the place down but I will still come back as the food is delicious What a find !! Best avocado on toast ever     Great decor and quick friendly service . Highly recommend Amazing place for coffee and baked goods. However the prepared food i found to be both very expensive and a tad disappointing, except for the pizza which Id def recommend. Vegetarian options: veggie and vegan options are available Wheelchair accessibility: Toilets are down a narrow flight of stairs, not accessible. Ive always loved going to KC Peaches. As a student its a really nice option for the ol wallet. However, after today, I dont really feel that keen on visiting any of their branches. The first issue was that having ordered Too Good To Go, we arrived at the store only to find it was cancelled. I enquired at the till as to why (due to an abundance of food being present). I received a curt reply that this was definitely going to sell in the next half hour; reader, it didnt. This was fine honestly though, I understand that an establishment needs all its profits. However, I decided to take part in the 50% off in the last hour deal. I went to the checkout, only to be met by an incredibly sour worker, who gave no greeting or indication of the price. It was only after tapping that I realised I was charged full price. Apparently it was take away only (depsite literally every other branch being sitting in, and the Hot Food at 50% off sign not having that stipulation). I was given absolutely no offer of compromise, or any kind of empathy. I do understand a business needs to be run, but honestly, the staff were so rude. Theres way better budget places that wont treat you like youre imposing on them tbh. Full Vegan Irish breakfast was fantastic, especially with the glass of fresh squeezed orange juice and an americano. Great discovery, the coffee is excellent, the service is excellent, the porridge is very good. Only a shame not to have porridge with cinnamon because I love it. I recommend... We bought last week 5 pastries. 3 of them were moldy. We went back the next day and explain our problem. The staff didn t seem concerned at all and didn t do anything about it. We will never ever come back to this place. Nice place to have a coffee with a sweet treat. The chocolate cookie was super good!! I highly recommend this place. it has a pleasant atmosphere, the staff is very helpful, the food is delicious, multiple options. Visiting KC Peaches As frequently I can   lovely food and coffee. Great place for business lunch as well Eat well; live well Well, you wont do the first of those here. Do not go here for good customer service the staff was rude and unfriendly from the moment my girlfriend and I walked in and we received snarky comments and unprofessional attitudes when we ordered our food. The food itself is ok but probably not worth the money and a bit bland. Will not eat here again. Staff are very sweet. I asked for my iced latte blended and they did it for me! THANK YOU One of the best hot chocolates (milk) I have tried in Dublin"
110,KC Peaches Cafe St. Stephen's Green,4.025,"I had hoped for a freshly cooked Irish breakfast but received a plate of mildly warmed up pre-cooked ingredients, apart from the egg and mushrooms. My wifes dish proved to be better quality. The coffee is amazing, but avoid the vegan breakfast! It was overcooked and bland. The only decent thing was the toast, which, according to the menu, is a nice granary bread, not the white toast that I was actually given. Wont be eating there again. Whats worse is, you have to pay when you order so there is no comeback when your food is as awful as this was. Also, a single mushroom cut in half is pretty stingy. Very very disappointing. Love the KC peaches for the lunch. You have too many options and everything tastes great! For the money you pay (12  average), You get quality food of great quantity (as much as you can fill in your plate). They have seating both at two levels and an outdoor seating too. Cant recommend it enough. I wishhh we had KC Peaches in the UK! Absolutely lovely staff. Such a variety of salads (both delicious and nutritious!). Some really tasty toasties too :) The food was delicious, also great music and excellent service! Overall a nice cafe, seating inside and outside. The layout to order food is a little confusing but the staff are nice. The full Irish breakfast was very filling and nice, some items were a little tough. Prices are decent for good portion sizes. The service is appalling. So much staff and they are all like zombies walking around. The classical music playing in the background is depressing. In the hour I was there so many people complaining for all different reasons. On the plus side the food is good and large portions. Good coffee and food with a wide selection. Friendly staff and good atmosphere but a little crowded. I would definetly recommend this place for a brunch! KC Peaches Cafe in St. Stephens Green Dublin offers a delightful dining experience. We had a delicious breakfast at the cafe, with the breakfast burrito being tasty and satisfying. My friends were particularly impressed with the quality of the Irish breakfast, considering it one of the best theyve had. The latte I ordered was fantastic and added to the overall enjoyment of the visit. The cafe provides both indoor and outdoor seating options, including a peaceful basement room. Highly recommended for a memorable dining experience! Perfect location next to Shelbourne Hotel on Stephen s green.  Seating inside and outdoors with a good breakfast menu.  Food is cooked nicely, portions are generous and the prices fair.  Service professional and friendly.  Easy ordering, casual dining and nice range of juices and drinks. Went in for lunch, lovely restaurant. Both got the fiery chicken. Burger was lovely but would have loved a bit of spice. Nice place for a lunch. Great choice of hot and cold sandwich prepared on order. The buffet as quite a lot of choice for the size. The pastries were excellent. I recommend the Micheals toasties and lemond bar. I had the breakfast burrito with bacon. It was to die for. Not too heavy, but enough to get you started for the day. One of the best I ve ever had. My friend had the porridge with fruit. She LOVED it. This place definitely lives up to the reviews. Best breakfast I ve had so far here. It was so good we went back the second morning. I had the French toast with bacon and a side of scrambled eggs. My friend had the ham and cheese omelette. Both were good, but I liked the burrito better. My friend said the omelette was the best she s ever had. Nothing special, with full Irish breakfast tea & coffee should be included with price ( no hasbrown) Very good place.  Stuff wryly friendly and helpfully.  Good selection of food nice cakes . Definitely will come back again.  Well done KC Peaches For me its the best place so far we have had a breakfast. They have both self-service and table service, and we chose the latter. First of all, you order the drink, and there are some types of menu, with veggie option included. They were a lot of choices and I chose a big omelette with some toasts, and it was really good. Looking around every table, food looked good, so I assume that other ones are good too. Staff is friendly and it not very expensive, and location is just perfect. We really loved the breakfast burrito, so much so we came back the following day for the same again. Tasty and healthy and not overly expensive. Good food, fair prices. They had sold out of an item ordered but were able to substitute. Ideal for a quick but complete breakfast/lunch.  My table was clean and was able to sit right away. The food served was cold (it had been prepared and left much too long before being taken out). New staff members with poor english were left to struggle with customers (poorly managed) rather than being coached and trained as they should be. Not too bad, music was not to varied, but we were served quickly. It was the end of the service so not much else to say. Rainy day but clean inside, and not too noisy, honestly better coffee than insomnia/Costa/etc. Nice view on st Stephens green Dietary restrictions: I think there are some gluten free options, I didnt see any today (end of shift) Parking: City center so impossible to park right outside, a few car parks (expensive) around, 5min walk 3 EUR to add bacon to a breakfast burrito! Smoked bacon breakfast burrito used to be a regular breakfast menu item, costing 9.50 EUR or something in that range. Good food, but come on now... Hipster and vegans friendly place   good spot for quick lunch, coffee or meeting. I had chicken curry and pork schnitzel which turn out to be a little bit too spicy  - I would recommend add info about that. Great cage with wonderful selection of tasty treats. Fast serving times, welcoming staff and delicious food, splendid selection abd quality of desserts, and gorgeous portion sizes. Will go again. Great variety of food, and it tastes delicious. Staff are helpful and attentive. Highly recommended I visited this coffee shop on Christmas Eve and had a very poor experience.  Ive visited this particular coffee shop before and found it very nice but unfortunately not this time and I certainly wont be back again.  I brought my wife and my daughter and her family. Because it was very busy, we used the extra seating downstairs, which was very untidy, but a staff member cleaned it up promptly. My real problem arose when my wife was overcharged ( 2 cakes instead of 1) and when she returned to the counter to instruct the cashier ( wearing a pink jumper) of this the cashier shrugged and took money from the till and handed it to my wife muttering some sort of a begrudging apology. Because of this incident, we only had half of what we would have normally ordered, but instead, we walked down the street to an excellent Spar shop where we enjoyed a nice cup of insomnia coffee and a few cakes. I have definitely had my last visit here. It has a comfy view through streets and when the sun is out it hit tables making it look almost as peach color? is comfy while You drink a chai latte. Regular pastries, bathroom a bit slooppy Food First day in Dublin and we were searching for a coffee and some good breakfast. We havent been disappointed here. Only thing is that the waiter seemed a bit too motivated because it seemed that he was checking on us to finish the plate all the time. Also he didnt reminded us that in the breakfast a drink is included. So I ended up ordering the drink before and got the free one only after asking. Nice place to stay and eat. Free water to drink. You can choose between 3 sizes for eat in or takeaway. There are cakes and other sweet stuff or hot food like potatoes, rice and pasta or you can choose between a lot of sandwiches. For drinks you can have coffee or juice or tea.. They also have cold drinks. Very nice and modern atmosphere. Friendly staff. I recommend that place! Was there with 2 friends Service is appalling, they handed me a tea with no milk, sugar or teaspoon, by they time time they handed it to me, my tea was way to strong as I couldnt get tea bag out. The staff walk around looking like zombies even though there is lots of them and are in no way under pressure. Food was super tasty and service was great. The drink mint 2be so refreshing, recommended 100% What a great place. Been here twice, once it was chock a block full, another early Saturday morning with very few people. In both instances the food was inspired. The bar manager was quite rude, she would not give us  5 in coins as change for a muffin (even though the barista girl had already accepted) after we politely asked for the coins as we needed them for the bus. Bad service. Amazing!at least their desserts look as good as they taste! FOOD is decent and a nice price too. I had a great experience at KC Peaches. Alona was so nice and made sure me and my friend had the best experience. She made the best cup of mocha I ever had Very Nice food and very kind people!! The manager is top!! Love it! Food A really nice cafe, one of the best in town. Tasty coffee and food. Special thanks for latte by brown haired girl, she looks like she has experience in latte art. Overall great spot for daily lunches! Visited the St. Stephens Green branch. Seems to be a busy place. We just got a matcha latte and cafe latte. Both were very good. The decor is simple and modern with ample seating indoors and a few tables outside. Wouldn t go out of my way to come here but if passing by would probably stop and go in for a drink if I needed a break. Exceptional customer service, with an outstandingly warm and friendly staff. The culinary experience was remarkable. A heartfelt appreciation to Jessica, whose gracious and empathetic service greatly enhanced our breakfast experience. Amazing place! Vibrant atmosphere,  comfortable, cleaned and well located. Staff very kind, special pink hair girl always with a big smile and enthusiasm! You got a new customer! Food : 5/5 Kc Peaches St Stephen s Green is great  atmosphere and food. I went for breakfast and they had a good selection of plates. I had the most delicious avocado toast ever.  Ice coffee was superb. The warm welcome and excellent service made the service extraordinary. I strongly recommend Kc Peaches St Stephen s Green."
111,Kaph,3.8,"Unfortunately my experience was not the best as the barista took a while to start making my coffee then spent even longer making it. I was waiting there for approximately 20 minutes and there was no one else there but me for a while. Not sure if this is was an off day so I ll definitely be trying again. The two stars I m giving are for the girl who had a country accent, she was lovely. The other with dark hair was not nice. When we asked for a lid for our coffee s our response was a roll of the eyes and a grunt to  they re over there . The coffee was great but from someone who works in the service industry, quality AND service makes up for the place and for the service of this place I would not recommend! If you re going to work in this industry, please don t put other people down just work in a different industry simple! Ive been a regular at Kaph for the past 8 years, and its consistently impressed me. In my opinion, its one of the best coffee spots in Dublin. They offer delicious coffee, and the atmosphere is always inviting. Whether youre looking for a place to catch up with friends or relax with a good book, Kaph is the perfect spot. Highly recommend! They have great matcha lattes! Limited seating upstairs but has a really cute vibe to sit and chat! The worst place Ive been so far. The staff are acting like they are doing u a huge favor, definitely need some training on how to deal with people. They don t have any flavour syrup and when I asked for that they act like I had committed a crime. Don t recommend this place, the coffee was disgusting, it tasted like if they had taken the water out a dumpster. Didn t try the food, my friend who was with me said it was good. The place was clean and tidy, the music wasn t loud, the only problem is just the staff and theirs attitude I didnt see it on the menu, but apparently, you have to pay extra for a smile here. I asked for a shot of caramel in my iced latte, and the barista gave me a look of disgust. Next thing I know, Im getting dragged out back and slapped with a wet fish. The whole staff seemed too cool for school It was a sunny day, folks! Cheer up Love the space to read or write down, clear environment. Always getting the matcha, if Im early for once I might like to brunch here One of Best coffee   in the dublin Highly recommended Food Never seen lots of rude staff all together before. They are not welcome to customers at all. It takes so long time to make coffee and when you want to pay the behavior is so bad! I do understand busy time but all you have to say sorry we busy thats it. If you dont like what you do than dont do it. It represents the place so bad. No recommend at all! Really a lovely spot for a coffee of your choice! Their roast is definitely different than the rest! Lovely but of seating as well for a day like today afternoon when it was nicely sunny! Will definitely visit once again Cute little place to get a coffee in Dublin! It can be tight inside when trying to order, but their coffee is pretty good. They offer dairy free alternatives and there s seating available upstairs. Lovely place for a coffee, tea or catching up with people. Lovely space and seating to the back of the space Staff are incredibly nice I would definitely recommend They have a great selection of coffee, treats and teas Has outdoor seating A mixture of high seats and tables and benches Space for buggies Bathrooms to the back They open really early which is great. I dropped by just to grab coffee and wasnt disappointed. I also got an almond croissant and it was delicious. Their staffs are all so friendly and the place has a great ambience. I d come back to try more next time :) The iced coffee was really tasty and a good size. The service was prompt and friendly. You can buy coffee to take home with you if you want. Seating in the actual shop is limited but there is more upstairs. They take card. The baked goods looked delicious! Tasty coffee, but from all the hype I was expecting the best Ive ever tasted and Ive definitely had nicer in Dublin. The layout for ordering and picking up is chaotic, for that reason alone I probably wont be back but thats a personal preference! Lovely staff and the cakes looked nice! There were lots of people ordering matcha and chai so perhaps its more a spot if thats your drink of choice! Great coffee and pastry! Loved the chill atmosphere and friendly stuff. Definitely a good spot to visit when exploring Dublin. Just had 2 chais from here which were undrinkable. Maybe it would be different if getting a coffee, but a good chai shouldn t be too hard to manage as it had unfortunately had zero taste, which for  4.70 was a big let down on a chilly day Great speciality coffee, decent pastries, nice upstairs sitting area, chilled environment and fantastic music even though there are no speakers upstairs. Pretty overpriced probably due to location and high-quality coffee, the service was fast and efficient as well. I wish it would have been possible to have my coffee in a proper mug instead of a takeaway paper cup. I was really frustrated when I saw the 30 mins max stay time, it truly feels like they want you out of there asap to leave room for new customers which really made my stay uncomfortable, also it was not possible to use laptops or study which is also what cafe are built for. I personally would not come here to have a chat with a friend or something like that knowing that after a certain time you are no longer supposed to be there. Wouldn t come back. cute coffee shop, nice location. coffee was very mediocre for the price sadly. my americano just tasted like water. size of the place is very small so got loud and busy quickly. pastries were really stale but looked pretty. Dietary restrictions: vegan options Heard so much about Kaph and decided to pop in! Would say the shop front doesn t stick out so much but the line certainly does! Downstairs is quite a small space and something needs to be done about where to stand while waiting / the way the staff call out the orders. Got an oat milk capacity which was  4.70 so quite pricey (wish places didn t charge extra for milk alternatives!) but it was really good. Also tried a regular latte and quite enjoyed it despite not liking lattes! Didn t venture upstairs this time. Great coffee. Warm and cozy place Was excited to come, but sadly the experience felt most unwelcoming by the staff there this morning. When I walked in, they stopped smiling and their conversation. After I got my food, I could see them resume their conversation and being pleasant and warm to each other, even a bit of dancing. Would have been great to have experienced the friendliness peoples reviews were talking about here.  They also gave us takeaway cups and brown bags for the pastries when we asked to dine in - not sure if thats how its meant to be,  but it added to the sense of not feeling welcome. Will absolutely not come back. Coffee was good but staff was not friendly, maybe it was a super busy day but this was the least warm and polite place in Dublin. Also the place is really small to relax I would only recommend to take away Woman who served me today with dark hair and a load of piercings was pretty rude to customers. Mumbled when customers asked to her and wouldn t make eye contact when she was speaking to customers. Not a very pleasant customer service experience. Back in Dublin after 5yrs, I wanted to visit one of my fav coffee places worldwide. Still top notch flat white, choice of cakes is rather limited though. Prices have definitely increased FW 4  + chocolate tartlet 3 , but this is unfortunately a general trend in Europe, lately. Overall still a great spot for delicious coffee. Very little space but full of life. Young people with laptops, people walking the dog (entering with the dog), people of all ages working nearby and stopping to have a coffee. Has small place outside. Its so relaxing there. The team of people is very knowledgeable about coffee. And yes, the most important: the have good quality coffee and tea. Try it. I go there at least once per months, I work nearby bad service and bad coffee. also no filter coffees. that is not a specialty coffee and reminds me starbucks. come and try and tell me your opinion. had a cappuccino and it was a joke. telling you this review as a specialty coffee owner from vienna (empress). regards alex I got a delicious oat latte and vegan pistachio and lemon mini cake here today. Extensive coffee menu and multiple treat options (including vegan). The constant queue outside is a visual testament to this establishments reputation. Eco cups AND lids. Friendly staff. Top notch! Went twice during my trip as it was very close to my hotel. Delicious both times Lovely place for coffee and pastries. Nice atmosphere. Love the vibe :) Got the carrot cake and coconut milk latte. Super yummy food and great coffee. The milky texture and freshness of coffee is amazing. Friendly staff. There is a bench outside facing the sun. It s mostly crowded due to well deserved high demand. It s pricey therefore 4 stars. Delicious - nice and simple place that offers some of the best coffee you ll find in Dublin! The almond croissant had fresh almond paste which was much appreciated! They have a small seating area but there are often chairs and tables outside where you can enjoy the weather. To start, Coffee was very nice    which is the main thing Queuing system is a bit all over the place when it was busy, squashed between the front door and the counter (appreciate not much staff can do about this) Asian female staff member nice and friendly however, second female staff member wearing lots of jewellery couldn t look more unwelcoming (nothing to do with how she dressed)  looked like she just didn t want to be in work or speaking to the general public.. her face looked like she had the world on her shoulders.. maybe she did today  but she seemed to perk up and smile when someone she seems to know arrived in  also barking orders at people because the music was clearly too loud for anyone to hear what the staff were saying Not the relaxing vibe I d look for in a coffee spot but appreciate this isn t everyone s jam! It s hard to get a matcha latte right. But Kaph knows how to do it right and well. Ordered a matcha with oat milk and it was phenomenal. Best mocha in the city so far ! Small coffee shop with modern, creative vibes. Love the atmosphere there. The coffee was excellent. Healthy and decadent dessert options. Side note: no laptops allowed on the weekends to allow space for all the weekend patrons. I get my coffee here every morning because its the best espresso in town and everyone of the staff are always great craic and up for a chat sorry but this place is a bad vibe! matcha has sugar in it? gross. staff was incredibly rude and pastry was dry af. My exhaustion was gone once I entered the place. Amazing staff with friendly approach right from the beginning and even better coffee. Matcha was spot on ! One of the finest coffee shops in Dublin. The staff are dreams. Coffee is top tier. Great seating area upstairs. Theres a reason this place is busy. Getting coffee here always gives me a big smile. Very nice coffee, Friendly staff, Nice and cosy place! What else you need! Food : 5/5 |"
112,Kellogg's Skyline Croke Park,4.9,"My daughter and I visited in August. We had a really great time visiting Croke Park. The views from on top of Croke Park and seeing Dublin City in a new way was awesome. The visit was complimented by our guide Seamus B. He was entertaining and knowledgeable. Id recommend anyone visiting Dublin to see the home of GAA Excellent visit to Croker for the  Skyline  tour. Our guide Cian was really exceptional (even for a south-sider) and his knowledge and passion shined throughout the tour. Highly recommend for locals or visitors alike! I highly recommend the skyline walk weather wasnt great but cleared a little when up there   views of Dublin City and surrounding county are unreal Great guided tour, our guide was very informative knew his stuff about Dublin, Irish weather held off for our duration, even if your afraid of heights take the tour, you feel very safe with the high rails and sturdy walkway, the height above the city really gives you a different perspective of the place and the museum tour at the end is self guided allows you to take in the history of gaa at your own pace Great experience. Great views of Dublin. Easily accessible via public transport. Will definitely recommend to friends. Great experience, whether you are a tourist or a local. The your lasts 90 minutes and offers unparalleled views above Dublin. The guide had great stories to tell that even the locals didnt know about. There is plenty of time to take in the scenery and to pick out your favourite Dublin landmarks. The Skyline tickets also allow access to the GAA museum in Croke Park - a good way to end a visit to the stadium. The tour was different and not scary, as I was expecting, but thoroughly enjoyed it. Owen was an excellent guide, warm speech, with jokes so fast, that I missed a lot until thinking of what he said later. Amazing views of Dublin. We were late due to Dublin Bus being late/cancelled and they were really accommodating and brought us up to catch up with the tour. Everyone was really lovely from the reception staff, the girl that brought us to join the tour and our tour guide Martin. We went on a sunny day so the views were amazing and you could see far in the distance. We made a day of it with this tour at 11:30, lunch at Shouk at 13:30 (10 minute walk) and a walk up to the National Botanic Gardens after. Cannot be beat especially on a sunny day. My dad and I did this tour on our first day in Dublin. It was a cool way to get your bearings of the city. The stadium is very neat and has a museum to get the history of the games played there. Went with limited expectations with my son but It was amazing,  the tour Guide Anna really made this experience for us as she was funny yet knowledgeable. All in all this was a great surprise for my son and I , we loved it. Great tour,Martins a mighty man at this racket,and very enjoyable tour of the dublin styline ,by far the best view of dublin at height. Great tour and a chap called cian was our guide very informative and good crack enjoyed it well worth a visit!! This is my second time to do the tour. Its a great experience with fantastic views of Dublin. The tour guide we had was a Dub and he was excellent and he was very knowledgeable and friendly. I would highly recommend the tour weather permitted as there I no shelter we were lucky we avoided the rain today. Great tour. Well worth it. Learned a lot about the GAA. Tour guide was very informative about the city. It s not just a walk along the top of the stadium. It s very safe and they clip you to a safety harness for the optional pitch view. If you get a chance then take the tour. Great views of the city. Would be lovely in warm weather! Really wonderful views, but the tour guide not only had a strong Irish accent but was talking extremely fast and not very clearly. He did not seem to be very interested in having foreigners listening to him, but kept communicating with the Irish visitors. Except for that (could just have been an exception, too) it was a nice experience. Cian was a fantastic tour guide today even when the weather was bad he took us back under shelter and gave us more info about the stadium until we could continue. Clearly spoken and plenty of time to take photos. My partner and I definitely enjoyed this tour and guide more than the museum tour. This was a really great tour. The guide was wonderful and some knowledgeable. I wish we had more time and could have had a longer tour we easily could have made it last another 30 min. The tour was 1.5 hrs long. Great views of the whole city. I would try to do it on a day where the weather is clear so you can see far and be comfortable in the elements. Brilliant tour Guides there were superb Tour guide Connor was the absolute highlight, very knowledgeable about Dublin and tried his best to keep everyone involved and engaged the whole time!!! Would absolutely recommend to a friend Excellent guide with lots of interesting facts. Fantastic views of Dublin. Breathtaking views you pretty much see the entire City centre, the kids were amazed The tour guide that went around with the group my daughter and was in was amazing,the views were breath taking highly recommend doing this The skyline tour is fab, we were fortunate that our experience was blessed with a lovely sunny day. The guide was great craic and very informative. We had trip on 8th Sept 1pm tour and it was truly amazing. Thanks to John for a brilliant morning at Croke Park! The walk itself was super cool and John was so interesting, enthusiastic and funny! Learned so much about the history of Croke Park and Dublin even though I ve lived here for the past 6 years!! Would definitely recommend. The visit was absolutely original. Once equipped the visitors with harness, we went on the roof where a walkway with different points of view allows for a 360 degree view of the city. At the end we arrived on the field where you can see the size of this stadium. Wonderful experience. Excellent way to pass a couple of hours. Well worth it. Our guide was called Aaron and he was brilliant. Well up for banter, informative but charismatic at the same time. My family and I loved the Skyline. I would recommend both the the Skyline and Aaron. I dont feel the tour would be the same without him. To anyone that is interested in both Dublin city and GAA or just looking to learn about a lovely piece of irish culture and history it is a must to experience. Loved it. Martin our tour guide was very friendly and looked after everyone so well. Great day Liam is a fun tour guide, very informative with humor. Enjoyed it and would recommend Great experience to see the Irish history of Sport presented in such an ideal location Great tour. Conor was our guide and he was very informative and entertaining. The kids loved it. Fantastic experience John our guide was excellent Great tour. Gives unrivalled views over Dublin city and our tour guide, Cian, gave us a great insight into the history of Dublin. Is a must if in Dublin or are a GAA fan. I highly recommend this. You learn a lot about Dublin and the gaa museum is worth a look too. Excellent tour. Couldnt have asked for better weather so clear views all around. Tour guide was very knowledgeable. Second time Ive done this. Great experience Super tour,.Family friendly and well worth a visit. Our guide Jerry was excellent. Great tour, brilliant guide and the museum is really good, its included in the price of the skyline tour. Bring your own hurl and Sliotar to measure your speed in the museum Great tour. Fun for all the family"
113,Keoghs Cafe,4.825,"One if the best scones Ive tried. Nice crust and soft inside, not dry at all. Lasted me the whole day because it was so big. For dine in I had the scrambled egg and a hot chocolate. The egg tasted very plain, the avocados were not ripe, but the tomato and bread were nice. Staff were friendly and service was an ok speed, it was very busy. Hot chocolate was nice. It s definitely one of the best cozy places to see in Dublin for the breakfast, super client oriented stuff, tasty food and truly Irish spirit from the first time you stepped in      Highly recommended!!! I ordered eggs with avocado and sun dried tomatoes so delicious It is very popular and there is often a queue, but I can confidently recommend it because the food, pastries and lattes are delicious. The  staff was very kind to me today, but I think I was unintentionally rude as I dont speak English well. I would like to apologise to her. Food This was my first Irish breakfast experience in Dublin and it was pretty good, but nothing mind blowing. I think that s more of my personal preference of the dish than a critique of how it was made. My boyfriend ordered a club sandwich and we were shocked by the portion - it was also decent but not memorable. There s lots of seating in different nooks and crannies which adds charm to the atmosphere! Went here for some breakfast, we had ordered and were directed to take a seat. Beverages came out quite quickly and were presented quite nicely, but there was a very long wait for food. It was quite busy which we respectfully understood that it would take some time but you would not want to be going here hungry. Food was only okay, we ate it because we were so hungry but the bacon was very over cooked. The atmosphere felt chill yet chaotic, people had to find their own way around to seating, even the elderly. So if you had paid for your food and expected a table you could be unfortunate. Atmosphere was very cozy. Staff (Tommy) was very friendly and super attentive. The portion size for the scrambled egg with sour dough, sun dried tomatoes and avocado was a generous portion size. Really appreciated the butter packet being warmed on the sour dough bread.  Irish stew was watery, tasted ok but not mind blowing and taste better than it looks. The mixed berry crumble muffin was delicious - very fluffy and moist. Overall would recommend coming. Fresh juice juice and chai latte was good. Lovely food and great service. A little cramped around the service desk but it adds to the charm in a way. Ate here a few days while we were in Dublin and were never disappointed with the breakfast or the pastries. Lovely veggie breakfast also which is hard to come by in a lot of places. Vegetarian options: The veggie options are really good, from pastries and scones to veggie breakfasts as good as the meat ones. Got recommended this spot for breakfast and managed to get a table in the back. It was a great cappuccino to go with a very filling breakfast. Quiet busy at 7am is also a good sign with quite a few takeaway orders. At first I only came for a cappuccino, but after a week in Dublin, and 3 trips back to Keoghs, I can confidently say this is one of my favorite spots in the city. Slightly tucked away from the tourists in Temple Bar, Keoghs is quaint and homey. Tables are first come first serve, but I never had an issue with seating. They have charging ports and outlets available, which is convenient because my phone is never charged. Absolutely everything they offer is excellent, but the scones are exceptional. Prices are reasonable, I m a poor college student and I found it affordable. Come early in the morning to find piles of fresh scones. I tried the lemon poppyseed, blueberry, and raspberry, and they were probably some of the best scones I ve ever had. Absolutely cannot miss. The cappuccinos are well-done and affordable. You get a pretty big cup for  4.50 I believe. I was able to get non-fat milk instead of whole. It had a good amount of foam and had nice flavor. I came with a group for breakfast on my birthday (St. Patrick s Day  ) and the portions were huge. There was a line out the door at 9:30, but it moved quickly. The omelets could serve two people, maybe even three, and looked delicious. The pancakes also looked beautiful. I ordered the full irish breakfast, which was exactly how I wanted it. Everything tasted fresh and had great flavor, very authentic. If you re walking past Keoghs, whether you re visiting for a day or a month, I d highly recommend that you stop by. Even if you re just grabbing a scone, I guarantee you won t regret it. Side note: The scones do not come with clotted cream, only butter and jam. There was an English woman in front of me who was extremely upset they didn t offer clotted cream and ended up not ordering a scone. Truly her loss. They are delicious without clotted cream. Absolutely amazing place for breakfast and brunch in the heart of Dublin. Highly recommended and prices affordable. Open since 6.30 am! That s impressive. Thanks a lot to Paloma for her kindness and help. The pancakes are delicious The only negative thing that wasn t their fault, was a man having breakfast next to us and he was so scruffy and bad smell.. This was insane! Definitely stop by this place if youre in Dublin. The breakfast was so tasty, plus the portions of the scrambled eggs were super, super huge (easily one plate could be enough for two people). Plus, the guy behind the counter was so friendly. Kind of the perfect place. The place is super yummy! I had one of the best muffins ever and their scones were unreal. I had a peach cobbler muffin and pear/vanilla scone and I wish I was able to try more flavors Came here for our first irish breakfast. This place gets crowded, so be prepared to wait in line, and for your food if it is during busy hours. The food was good. We ordered the full Irish breakfast and breakfast bap. The bap is a sandwich with most of the items from the full breakfast minus the mushroom and tomato. I would recommend the bap, especially if youre not as hungry, since its a little cheaper and easier to eat as a sandwich. The staff is very friendly. They also have a great selection on scones, muffins, and croissants. My first time in Dublin, came here starving early in the morning, filled my tummy with absolutely delicious Irish breakfast! Very decent food, cant wait to try other stuffs next time. You might want to be a little early, since the place can get crowded. Ill definitely be back for brekkie again! We were here for brunch with seven people. The food was perfect and the service super friendly. We had full breakfast, pancakes and scrambled eggs. Highly recommended! 10 out of 10! Do not leave Dublin without visiting this cafe! I cannot rate it highly enough! The food and atmosphere were amazing. Tommy who was working the day we visited was one of the nicest, friendliest people we have ever come across. Great Irish breakfast, best coffee ever, especially the chai latte. People were queuing out the door to get their hands on the freshly baked cakes and pastries. If I ever go back to Dublin, I would visit this place every morning for breakfast and get take away items too. I wish we knew about this place sooner. The quality & quantity of ingredients, very tasty coffee, reasonably priced and beat EVERY full Irish breakfast we have tried (over 14 throughout the city - including Bewleys on Grafton Street). The owner/manager was lovely and the staff all very friendly. They also have a fantastic selection of pastries and a great selection of music. Good atmosphere, giant scones, and a proper sausage roll  service is quick and all staff are nice Lovely place with huge variety of goodies and super friendly people serving with a big smile. I had the rhubarb crumbles muffin and it was right out of heaven! Don t miss this place! Food : 5/5 Felt like more of a local spot. Stopped in early for some coffee and pastries before a tour. They make a great latte and the raspberry scone was delicious. Even came with some additional raspberry jam. Good music and quiet since it was early. Nice staff as well. We went to Keoghs Cafe for a pre walk breakfast to fill us up for the day. We had the Irish breakfast and shared a cherry scone before hand. The staff were friendly and there seemed enough seating to find a table almost immediately. The overall decor was clean and tidy and the clientele varied, from students to tourists and commuters. I had a cappuccino, the coffee was of a good standard. The breakfast itself was filling with good portions of each item. The eggs were cooked well and the white and black pudding was delicious. Price wise it was reasonable for Dublin and I would return again. Wheelchair accessibility: There was a lip to the door which would impede access, it was also quite tight inside. Great food and atmosphere. The full breakfast was delicious and huge portions. Enjoyed everything about it. The lattes were extremely good, especially the hazelnut. So good I ordered two. My only gripe is the Wai time for food is extremely long. I think we waited for about 50min before our food came out. I would go here again if I saw that there wasnt a large lineup. Keoghs Cafe is a delightful oasis in the heart of the city, renowned for its warm, friendly atmosphere and exceptional service. The moment you walk in, youre greeted by the inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee and a cozy, charming ambiance that makes you feel right at home. The staff at Keoghs are genuinely friendly and passionate about coffee, always eager to offer recommendations and ensure you have a great experience. In addition to their outstanding coffee, Keoghs offers a delicious range of pastries and light bites, perfect for a quick breakfast or a leisurely lunch. In short, Keoghs Cafe is a must-visit spot that combines great coffee, excellent service, and a welcoming atmosphere, ensuring you leave with a smile every time. We stopped in on our first morning in Dublin. Its a nice little cafe that also serves full breakfasts. The service was good, the coffee was excellent. The scones were a bit dry but came with delicious jam so that helped. If we came back we would try the full breakfast. The dishes are simple and hearty. There is quite a wait at the cash register, before knowing if we will be able to be seated or not, then at the table to be served, but the service is pleasant. This place is amazing! After ordering the breakfast bap - I was chatting with the lady who works there about the scones which they are famous for. She kindly gave me one for free so I could try it and it was delicious! I got the one with pear in it. Great food, coffee and baked goods. Definitely worth a visit! Excellent breakfast in this cafe. The waiters and the owner are very kind and welcoming!! We had the scrambled eggs, tomatoes, avocado and the pancakes! It was excellent ! The quantity on the plates is enormous! I recently had the pleasure of visiting Keoghs Cafe, and I must say, its an absolute haven for coffee enthusiasts! As a cappuccino lover, I was thrilled to find that their cappuccino was a masterpiece   perfectly made, with a gorgeously frothy texture and a flavor that was truly exceptional. The attention to detail in crafting this coffee was evident, and it left me thoroughly impressed. Beyond the exceptional coffee, I was greeted by a friendly and welcoming cash counter attendant who took my order with a smile. Their warm demeanor added to the overall pleasant experience. The variety of muffin options caught my eye, and I couldnt resist trying the banana walnut muffin. It was a revelation   unbelievably soft and bursting with flavor. The balance between the sweetness of the banana and the nutty richness of the walnuts was just right, making it an absolute treat. For a heartier option, I opted for the chicken sandwich, and I was not disappointed. The food quality was top-notch, and the sandwich was delicious. The flavors melded together beautifully, and each bite was a delightful blend of taste and texture. Overall, my visit to Keoghs Cafe was a delightful journey of flavors and hospitality. From the exceptional cappuccino to the delectable banana walnut muffin and the satisfying chicken sandwich, every aspect of my experience was superb. I can confidently say that this cafe is a must-visit for coffee aficionados and food enthusiasts alike. I look forward to returning to Keoghs Cafe for another memorable experience! Quality food cooked to perfection.  We had porridge and poached eggs on toast and decided it was the best wed ever had.  Friendly people and good service Excellent spot for breakfast would recommend to any looking for a decent full Irish breakfast. Extremely busy but staff were polite and welcoming. Small wait which can be expect for cook to order breakfast. Will visit again when in the area. Full Irish was  14 coffee was extra  4 roughly. Not bad price for tourist area. Our first time visiting Keoghs Cafe, we found the staff to be very friendly and the coffee was really good here. Our Meals were all delicious and good portions. All of our food and drinks came out quite fast considering the restaurant was quite full. We will definitely be back soon. Thank you Keoghs Cafe. Affordable and Delicious We ordered an omelette and fried eggs with toast, and it was a delightful experience. The food was delicious, well-priced for the generous portions, and the service was attentive. A great choice if youre looking for a tasty breakfast without breaking the bank. We left satisfied and eager to return. The service and the food is amazing! The waiter really made sure we are happy. We got the Irish stew which is so delicious here. 100% recommend Food I visited Dublin for the day and Keoghs was one of the first places I visited so definitely started the day off good. The food came out quite quickly and tasted amazing. The service was great and servers were super friendly. A special mention to James M who really went above and beyond. Would highly recommend if you re visiting Dublin. First and foremost the food at Keoghs is excellent. The missus and I both had an Irish stew (served with mash) that was perfectly succulent and delicious. We went at lunch time on a weekend so the place was absolutely packed... We just about managed to get a table! Price was reasonable, staff were run off their feet but friendly enough. All the other food looked delicious, too. The greatest muffin in Dublin, in my opinion. The atmosphere of this cafe in the citys core is one of kindness and excellence. never empty Although I have yet to experience a treat inside, I am a frequent consumer of the takeaway. fantastic work; try it! Lovely cafe with a warm atmosphere. I enjoyed a full Irish breakfast and an exquisite cappuccino. The staff were very friendly. A must try for an authentic breakfast. It was really yummy. We did not really enjoy the scone; it was too dry. Cheap & cheerful majority of staff friendly as it was my first time there I was unsure how there system of ordering worked,one  staff a little snappy, table could have done with a clean prior to sitting but not the be all end all. Will be back! The pancake was so good. Fast and kind service. Excellent breakfast place. After 10am there is a lots of people so not recommended for digital nomad work."
114,Kilkenny Cafe,4.35,"In a flying and first visit to Dublin. Visited the cafe on 12 March and met with a wonderful healthy breakfast stall where I could have granola, overnight oats, exotic fruit, berries, and yoghurt etc. in a medium sized bowl, all for  6.50. That healthy and fulfilling breakfast saw me walk up and down the city centre an entire day with a small lunch later on! I stumbled upon this lovely cafe during a walk along Nassau Street and decided to go in for a wholesome brunch. Despite usually not being a fan of buffet-style eateries, I was impressed by the quality of the food. The service was okay, but what really stood out to me was the delicious food and the pleasant atmosphere. Although the food was lukewarm, which is typical for buffet-style places, it tasted very good. The variety of desserts was impressive, and the pricing was very reasonable. My friend has recommended this place to have a lunch and decided to check. The restaurant is quite big, so I easily found a free table and even had a chance to listen to a music band  . The portions were large so even the two scoops of mashed potato were more than enough for me  . I have ordered a hot chocolate. Since cashiers were very busy, the manager lady prepared it herself and even tried to make a heart design on the surface. That was so cute   she almost managed The place is big and you have lots of options of cooked food and pastries. We had a great brunch, for 10 euros you can have upto 5 items from the menu plus a variety of tea or coffee. Amazing breakfast for 10 euros, you can choose 5 things from the Irish breakfast + toast + tea/coffee. I tried both and prefer the tea. The place is big, good covid measures and have a really nice atmosphere. Breakfast and coffee are great. One of the best Irish breakfasts I ve had on the island. Gluten free raspberry scone also delicious. Get it even if you re not gluten free. Very expensive, and employees who are loud, we have the impression that we are disturbing them. I dont recommend. Very expensive (for no reason), & employees are super grumpy. Are we bothering you?! Only the young men with longer hair were nice. The salad bowl was good and worth the money, but they have very limited options for vegetarians. Vegetarian options: Salad bowl Overcooked eggs and a waitress at the self-service restaurant who makes an unpleasant remark about our French accent. The Irish served generously but not the tourists. A restaurant to remember for typical breakfasts! Lots of choice in savory, sweet and drinks! Quality products for a very reasonable price  9 for 5 pieces of savory food! Went for the food- stayed for the lovely shop. Wanted lunch after touring trinity college. The cafe was amazing. Just grab a tray and fill it with whatever you want, cafeteria style. The prices were great in our opinion. Live music was cute and entertaining. There was a family friendly feel that I loved. Delicious chocolate cookie and a good flat white. Nice busy atmosphere I didn t expect the breakfast was so tasty... it s a self service style so you get what you like. Breakfast deal was the food and coffee for  7 as I remember. They ve got plenty of tables and the shop downstairs. Cute cafe! Perfect breakfast to start a good day of sightseeing in Dublin. On the second floor you can have a beautiful view of Trinity College which is across the street. It s a buffet so you can really choose what you want! This used to be a decent place for coeliacs but not any more.  Hardly any options and even with options offered I was worried about cross contamination. Really really good find in Dublin!  7.95 for breakfast set of 5 items with coffee/tea of your choice. The live music is really good as well!  Would highly recommend people to this place!! Highly recommended !!!! Super great breakfast !!!! Cheap price and various choice for breakfast. The most important is that the staff are all friendly and generous !!!! Definitely will come for second time The staff is not aware of the fact that being on a Gluten Free diet means being sick with Coeliac Disease. They are least helpful when they are asked for options at the sandwich bar. They made an open sandwich with two small slices of G.F. bread with one leaf of salad and three slices of tomatoes. Price=4.5  I should have left the plate there. Avoid the place if you can. Vegetarian options: Little or no options. Avoid the place Dietary restrictions: Nn options Great for a snack. Located at the top of the store, the room is large and there are tables with a view of the park opposite. A place to get some decent home cooked hot food... well theres only two choices and quality reflects the price. Nothing to shout about but would go again. Theres cold or toasted sandwiches, wraps, and salad bowls. Its a department store cafeteria so dont expect luxury restaurant atmosphere! Good for a cup of coffee and pastry, too. A very nice place to have an Irish brunch, where you almost only meet Irish people, few tourists here Great spot near the Book of Kells. Excellent breakfast, and even better pastries! Not obnoxiously sweet, but just the perfect amount of sweetness. Lunch is AWESOME. They serve a nice juicy Roast beef - wish I had a picture to show it off. They also have Jazz each Sunday - really sets the tone for a perfect Sunday morning brunch before hitting the town. The coffee isn t half bad either, and pairs really well with the pastries. Solid choice Good food, large quantities, and reasonably priced. Atmosphere can be very busy and very loud. It is a bit chaotic and congested when choosing what food you want in the cafeteria-style food area. Salads were okay, Soup was really good, Key Lime Cheesecake was delicious and light. This is a great place to go for a quick bite. Go elsewhere if you want a quiet place to relax and take your time. Have been here a couple of times for breakfast and always have a great experience! Staff are always friendly and go the extra mile, I was there on Sunday and every staff member said hello both upstairs and downstairs. There is sometimes a queue in the restaurant but this always moves along quickly as the restaurant is very well staffed. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Restaurant is always spotless. Love this restaurant, 5 stars. Great. Much better than before covid. It was a stress free, enjoyable experience. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the scone and coffee were delicious. Worth mentioning that the scones and cakes were behind screens so not being touched/coughed on by everyone prior to purchase ! Great cafe for meeting people, decent food, nice atmosphere, and indoors! Better than many other cafes with regards to safety, security and adherence to Covid policy. Good place for meeting important clients or good friends for personal chat -  no buggies being slammed into you/your table, and no screaming kids! Definitely my go-to place for special occasions. Great lakes for ready to go snacks. We tried pastry here it was pretty good. Not that sweet yet delicious, just the way we like it. The cafe has a great glass view of Trinity college lawns. Cutting one star as place is a little noisy and chaotic. Avoid. Absolutely the worst coffee my family and I ever had. All saucers and glasses were dirty and sticky, table was nasty too. We waited very long at the barista and everything looked very disorganised while half of the staff was chatting away. Lastly, a minor thing but good to mention, the store on the ground floor proudly sells irish products and designs, they could commision an irish interior designer to make the cafe look less like a cheap plywood salvage warehouse. Had lunch with two friends here yesterday. Main courses involved salmon (my guests) on the one hand,  and turkey and ham on the other hand  ( my choice). Both were tasty, accompanied by roast and mashed potatoes and a selection of vegetables. Plenty of seating, with good coffee afterwards. A good range of salads were on offer as well as fresh soup. Glad I chose this venue  after visiting the National Gallery where the catering facilities are still closed. Its an amazing place, friendly staff and such tasty food. Lovely staff.  Wonderful pastries.  A little pricey for some items. Very clean.     And the soup is very very thin. I expect something more for  6.50 My favourite spot for a local breakfast experience and the nicest service that you can get. Good food, price was ok! Loved the choices of cake and the scones. An Irish institution, and serves the best gluten free scones in the country. Not dry, really tasty. A little old school being a favourite of the older generations. Always seems to have seats even if busy. Can I go so far as calling it an institution? I cant count how many times Ive gone in for breakfast. Its a family favorite. Such good scrambled eggs, potatoes and sausage. You can build out an incredibly tasting full Irish. Havent tried the lunch. Cheap, fast and really high quality. Local or visitor, go. Delicious food in the cafe on the first floor and wonderful design pieces on the ground floor.  Some other places may claim to have the best scones in Dublin - but they must be wrong, because the best scones are to be found here!  There are lots of tables but it is so busy that you might have trouble finding a free one at busy times. The unique items for sale on the ground floor are original and beautiful but can be expensive. The shop is lovely, but the cafe is amazing for breakfast. Scones to die for and soda bread toast we have been dreaming of. Jams and marmalade made in house. Perfect eggs and potatoes. Breakfast meats in generous portions. If you eat normal size, be sure to split with a friend, or three. A favourite place for tourists and Dubliners alike, including students from neighbouring Trinity College. The seating manages to be both rustic and comfortable, while food and beverages, if not exactly cheap, are of consistently high quality and beautifully presented. The staff are as friendly and helpful as are the staff on the main shop floor. My only criticism is the lack of customer lift, which makes accessibility a problem for those with mobility issues. Our favourite brunch place for Sunday. Best hot chocolate in Dublin and great brunch for an amazing price. And most important the sweetest jazz band ever, absolutely recommended :)"
115,Killary Harbour Sunset Viewpoint,4.85,"Wonderful landscape and history. A must-see for that curious traveler. Please drive safely. The country roads leading to and from are narrow and challenging to navigate. Killary Harbour is one of the three glacial fjords in Ireland, being formed during the last ice age in a process called glaciation where glaciers moved through the landscape cutting a deep valley where they moved. The 16km fjord separates County Galway from County Mayo, with the harbour at the centre reaching a depth of 45m. From the harbour you can see Leenane village behind the harbour view point, Leenane Hill, Binn Mhor Mountains, Mweelrea Mountains, and Ben Gorm Mountains. On the southern side of the fjord you can find a grass-covered road along which you can find ruins of an old famine village where a large population had attempted to sustain themselves before 1845 where famine devastated the region. It is recommended to truly appreciate the beauty of the region taking a boat tour will allow you to fully enjoy the scenery of the fjord and surrounding mountains. The fjord is also famous for it s angling and has a wide range of species such as mullet, mackeral, herring, salmon and trout. While that at the fjord be sure to look out for birds and mammals such as seals, otters and bottleneck dolphins. Route from Galway via Kilmore and Clifden by motorhome. Allow a good half day. Here the view of the Fjord is superb, it is worth stopping. Very beautiful place with a magnificent view of the Fjord and Connemara. Magnificent view of the fjord and mountains surrounding it. Great place to stop, large car park and many lovely shops and cafes around. A must stop place on the dual carriageway. One can enjoy the breathtaking sceneries around Hello, magnificent inlet. Great spot, shop , cafe and friendly pub(dogs allowed) Lots of free parking spaces. Great view A beautiful spot even on a wet January day  while I was driving around Connemara . Already looking forward to spending time there in the Summer Lovely views and interesting information.  Good cafe and restaurant across the road. Well worth a stop, and boat rides available. Watch the fjord go by Incredible views and a really nice meeting spot to start from for trips into Connemara Just wonderful ! A fjord in the middle of Ireland is magical! Nice little stop to taste a very good Irish coffee Lovely place to visit and good roads Magnificent on a summer evening, the light is brilliant. Stunning views Great location to take time out, super food and dont miss the crepes. Great scenery in this area, even on a dullish, wet day Its a must do for anyone touring the west of Ireland. Amazing views over the fjord here. The views are spectacular on a sunny day Fantastic ever-changing vista. Memorable. Very nice place to do again with family Lovely place to visit if out west. Just a natures paradise..just be there and enjoy the mother nature. Lovely views across water,mountains Heaven on earth, the place the people, beautiful The view is serenity in itself. Very nice views!! Worth a stop. Stunning view in the evening light. The most beautiful place in Ireland Great  viewpoint, very nice place Beautiful relaxing location Great sunset indeed! Beautiful beach area Beautiful views Wonderful views Amazing"
116,Kilmainham Gaol,4.85,"100% buy tickets at least 1.5 months in advance. If you couldn t check their website 24 hours in advance and they may have some availability. Fantastic tour leader and a great place to learn about Ireland history and some stories about political prisoners. Very interesting and informative tour about the more recent history of Ireland and their fight for independence. Our tour guide, David, was excellent and it felt like a storytelling theatre. A bit out of the way from most of the other touristy areas (if taking public transport) but well worth the travel. The tours book out but you can wait for same day cancellations by checking their website between 9:15-9:30. A unique experience of this jail, which has a lot of history to it. The experience comes with a guided tour of the facility and touching stories about the past. When in Dublin it s a site not to be missed. This is a must do while in Dublin. We didnt realize how long in advance these tours book up, but just lucked out on a cancelation. The tour is very well done, and we had an excellent tour guide who was passionate about the history and made it all the better. A lot of raw history to take in while there. Would reccomend it to anyone. Fascinating place to visit. The guides were very knowledgeable and friendly and we learnt a lot about the history of the place and indeed Ireland in general. Thoroughly enjoyed the tour and would definitely recommend visiting So glad I managed to get a ticket. I completely understand why its so popular and sells out so quick. Alan was an amazing guide with such passionate delivery. Would recommend anyone to try and go. A must-visit place steeped in history in Dublin. Remember to book in advance on the site, we had to think twice to visit this place. An audio guide with dialogues in foreign languages to be able to follow the visit would really be a plus! Its not easy to follow the guide in English. Excellent tour, worth a visit to learn the history of Ireland. We had Adam as our tour guide, he was excellent; you can tell he is very passionate about the history of Ireland and sharing it with others. Would highly recommend a visit when in Dublin Although the architecture is very unique and amazing. the history, the stories about this place is very sad and moving. From the famine to political prisoners, you will hear it all! This was such a good tour. Our guide was funny and yet had so much information to share. This is for all the history buffs... a must . Honestly, one of the most interesting place in Dublin ! Our tour guide, Adam, is a passionate et very nice man, who makes you feel the emotions of this place in just a few minutes, thanks a lot again !! Be just careful with the website for the reservation, theres a fake one (ending in buzz) that hijacks your bank card ! Absolutely amazing tour. Very interesting history of that place. Tour guide Mick 10/10. My 12 year old son was so interested. Always struggled to find tickets until I realized they release tickets between 9-9.30am most mornings. Booked a ticket to spend a Sunday afternoon  there. Guide was excellent, tour was well worth it. Very insightful, without the tour the musuem might not have had as much context, glad to have gone. This is the place where the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising were detained and executed. Visits are by guided tours only, and I would recommend booking a number of weeks in advance as they tend to be sold out quickly. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and clearly demonstrate their passion for the subject. The courtyard where the rebel leaders were executed is especially poignant. There is a museum at the end of the tour which provides a good overview of Irish history. I highly recommend a visit to this place in order to get a deeper understanding of Irish nationalism. Impressive visit to this place steeped in history. I liked the focus on people who left their mark on Irish history, it helped us better understand this complexity. Visit entirely in English, I do not recommend for children who risk getting bored as the visit lasts quite a long time; as well as people who do not speak English. However, the buildings alone are enough to impress. This visit is worth it. Go to a very interesting museum which adds elements. Be careful, places go quickly, book in advance. Really enjoyed this guided tour - local and very informative tour guide that went at a pace was easy to absorb whilst not feeling too lengthy.   Great to see the actual jail and walk through whilst hearing about the lives of some past inmates many of whom were political activists.   Would recommend as I would prebooking which can be up to 28 days in advance.  Our holiday days were all sold out but some additional tickets are released each morning 9-9:30am and we managed to get some of those. Our tour guide Adam gave us incredible tour. He was very enthusiastic about the place and provided us an amazing experience. Booking tickets in advance is recommended (especially if in a bigger group). Visited on Very good tour and museum.  You MUST book in advance though do check the website the night before or in the morning of the day you want to visit as its usually sold out but last minute tickets can sometimes become available. At  8 a ticket its a bargain. Come and visit the movie location of Paddington 2! Great place to learn about some Irish history, in particular history of human rights. Great tour and our guide was very entertaining and enthusiastic. Good deal for the price and a must do for anyone wanting to learn about the Easter Rising and mistreatment of the lower class, women and children. A must do in Dublin. Easy to buy tickets in line, but they run out fast. When we booked, only three days out of the next ten had a few slots open. Book ahead! Buy your tickets in advance, you need to pre-plan for this one! Parking is available on the street in front (pay & display with a max of 3 hours), or in a lot that s 5 minutes down the road. We parked out front as we had a tour at 9:45am and there was parking available. I loved this tour, the history and the space is incredible. Our guide, Harry, was very knowledgeable and very kind. The admission price was also very low and that was nice! My only negative is that this tour felt rushed, not by our guide, but in general. There is so much more to see and learn about, but you are limited to one hour and you are unable to see it all. Options for a self-guided walking tour should be available, as there are many of us who would prefer to learn, discover, take photographs, and roam on our own. Outstanding tour that gives a comprehensive look at modern Irish history over the last 200 years. Arguably, this prison was the site of the beginning of Irish Independence! We had a tremendous tour guide who provided a great overview of the former inmates and the significance of the jail in Irelands overall historical perspective. Must book 30 days out, or log on at 8:30-930 local time on the day of to book tickets. I like history, so Kilmainham Goal was perfect. Our guide, Daisy, spoke very clearly. It was easy to understand her no matter how far away we were from her. Kilmainham Goal has an interesting story and played an important part for the history of Ireland. It also has a little museum which is very interesting, too. You need to book your tickets in advance, because it is often sold out. Not far from it there is the Irish National War Memorial Park. I recommend taking a look because its stunning. On hot days it is perfect for a little break. History, the why, the what, the who  if you like museums and history and you are visiting Dublin this is a must! From Prison to National Monument! I recommend the guide tour Visited on Weekend Historical jail that s a short bus ride from the city center. Booked our tickets online in advance, as a tour is required (it does seems like it would be easy to get lost if you wandered by yourself). Our tour guide Jonathan was excellent - very knowledgeable and had good voice projection. Incidentally, he sounded a bit like Sean Connery to me. You check in at the door and wait until your group comes together before you start walking around. The tour was about an hour, and then you have a chance to wander on your own in the museum. There was a lot of history in the jail, and they did a really good job of providing context. There s a cafe as well as restrooms on the second level. It s a good spot for kids as well as big groups. If you come during the day, you could go for a stroll in the park afterwards. One of the MUST see places in Dublin! Very impressive building and full of Irelands history. It was very touching to walk here and hear the sad stories of many brave men and women that lived and often died here. History lesson live! This is one of the places that it is on the top ten visits in Dublin but for a very good reason. Youll learn a lot of things that you find on the internet. The guide is a great guy who really tries to make the tour informative and enjoyable in a way that makes it more of a duty rather than a job. Youre really left with impression that you understand the country better. Dont miss out. A place rich with Irish history, a must visit place for everyone. Our tour guide was Anthony, he was very knowledgeable and controlled the tone very well. We learnt a lot from him, from the easter uprising to Irish civil war, we understand how the Irish people endured such hardship and built their modern state. P.s remember to book the ticket for the tour in advance or else you have to rush for the cancelled tickets online on 0915 of the day of your visit. This place was unreal to experience. The prison has so much history and the tour guides were so informative. They did an amazing job restoring the prison as well. The tour took just over an hour and got to see the east, west wing and the museum. We had to buy tickets online. Note: if its full the day you are hoping to go online, check in the morning of. There was TONS of availability the morning of compared to being sold out days prior. Highly recommend this place!! Our tour guide Adam was nothing short of spectacular. I ve taken a lot of guided tours through museums, walking tours and whatever. But Adam got us involved in the story of the prisoners with such an immersion that this will remain an unforgettable experience to me. I think he holds a PhD in Theatre Sciences or if not he should be awarded one. The 1 hour tour is well worth it, but take some time and stroll through the museum as well. It s not overloaded but provides the exact right amount of very interesting pieces of Irish history. Best combined with other tours that get you warm with Irish history, otherwise i could imagine the real context of all that might be a bit hard to get - that s not on the guides, within an hour you won t learn everything about Irish history. Thanks staff and thanks particularly to Adam! Harry did a great job bringing the history alive in the tour. Lots of history and stories covered in the hour long tour. Great overview of the history of Ireland told through the fate of those imprisoned here. Highly recommend to those interested in Irish history. Excellent tour with an excellent tour guide (David). If you want a 200 year history of the jail and Ireland this is an hour you must do. Great value with access to the museum after the tour. Do not leave Dublin without going on this tour. Booking online in advance is advised as its extremely busy. Difficult to review this as its not the place that was the issue we had but the welcome from the staff. Arrived for the 10.45am booking at 10.30am as advised. Person that was at the door seen us arrive and as we got out one of the group who had mobility issues wanted to get something from the boot of the vehicle to help with the visit. We got to the door and the staff member who watched us from arrival called me (the driver) up to the front and said Your Late and we are Very strict on time here I checked my watch and it was now 10.46am and a few seconds (and i did show the watch) but its the way that the clients were made feel as here is staff member making a public show of a driver for being 1 minute late because that same driver was helping them as they had mobility issues. I really think this should have being handled this better as this was the 1st visit for their 1st family holiday to Ireland, and there was NO cead mile failte here. The visit itself was very good, and i would give 5 stars for that, but the experience this group had left a bitter taste, so Im giving it a 3 out of 5. I just loved it, the place, the vibe, the tour guide, the staff in general, the history behind it. And damn, the prison inside looks gorgeous as hell! I had a really lovely tour filled with historical facts mostly about the Easter rising (1916) and a bit about the Great Hunger episode of Irish history. The main space with all the cells and the big staircases is such a wonderful area. The entry tickets are really cheap compared to other tourist stuff you can do in the city center and its actually much better. Like the St Patricks Cathedral is nice and all but paying almost 10 euros for a church is a bit of a rip off (coming from a country where visiting cathedrals and such is free). Would recommend to visit this place if you have time. Its hella worth! We loved this tour! Our tour guide was unbelievable! Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. A great story teller! The restoration and preservation of this gaol is amazing and well worth the visit! It was included with our OPW card which was nice but I would have paid the entry fee regardless. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. This was maybe the best experience in Dublin! On one hand really informative and majestic, but on the other hand so sad and maybe not for younger children because all of the stories we were told. The guide Adam was the best guide I ever encountered! He had such a huge knowledge about the place and spoke with huge passion! Definitely a place you dont want to miss when visiting Dublin! One of the most powerful experiences we had in Ireland was visiting the 1796 Kilmainham Gaol. We saw both the old section and the east wing which was replaced with a new, updated design in the late 1850 s. Our tour guide, Mary, did an excellent job of telling us about the history of the jail/prison. She also shared the circumstances of some of the inmates and how they came to be there, including children during the Great Famine, and leaders of the 1916 Uprising. The museum provided interesting additional information. A good way to know some Irish history. The guide we got has done an amazing job at rendering the same in excellent emotional way. He did it with such passion which I have never seen in any guide until now. Overall it s an hour and half well spent. Dont skip this place when you are in Dublin. It s a former prison with so much history. The guided tour was really enjoyable, informative and the guide tells the stories about this place so passionately that I almost shed a tear. Cool fact - this place has been used filming popular movies like the Italian job and music videos of bands like U2 :) Highly recommend this tour. We had a great tour guide, Jonathan. Tour lasts 1 hour and you can freely walk around museum after. Prebook is a must. Amazing place. So much important Irish History is here and was started here. Not only is it an important place for all people of Irish decent to visit, but really everyone should come and see and learn the history and hear the story s. Our guid was very good at her job and communicated very well they brief story of significant importance. This is a place I would love to explore beyond physically and learn what else happened here in more detail pre 1916. This is a place that is well worth your time. A must go to."
117,Le Petit Perroquet,3.1,"Stopped by for a coffe and a croissant.  Ordered my regular coffee latter and a almond croissant.  The order was server quite quickly , coffee is decent but the pastry unfortunately didnt feel fresh. It seemed to be at least a couple of days old. It tasted not that bad but you could use it instead of a hammer   . Tho atmosphere is cute. So maybe I will give this place another try, maybe I was just not lucky that day E has breakfast here. Atmosphere and space was nice. Staff were polite but at times has communication challenge with English. Americano was ok. Food is average. Eggs Benny was a tad overdone, bacon undercooked, and the toast in French toast, not really toasted well. Searching for a place to eat late on Saint Patrick s Day that wasn t crowded. We found this place and even though they were closing soon they welcomed us and took great care of us. We purchased ham and cheese croissants and they were amazing. So thankful for their hospitality. Awful service. Place was cold. Front door wide open, to satisfy the staff. Customers didn t matter Guy serving  was rude,  and the staff are clueless. Bacon underdone and fatty. Toast not toasted. Scrambled eggs oily and bland, we did highlight our disappointment but the young guy had no interest in our comments we literally paid for our coffees, not the food,  stood up and left. Never to return again. Nobody really cared anyway. Im surprised by the negative reviews I see--this place has been good to me. Granted, Ive only had coffee but Ive gone out of my way to get coffee here because its good stuff. The staff have always been friendly and welcoming; the indoors looks cozy but Ive been enjoying the sidewalk seating, which has been neat, clean, and dry. Merci! Very disappointed with the croissant. A cheese (no ham included) croissant for 9 euro is crazy. They are not even tasty and I enquired about the price they said because we usually charge ham and fries with it I had no fries and no ham They literally are unprofessional and rude and I will never come again (also will tell people not to go) Had a cappuccino too there it was ok. Im so shocked and disappointed and the service is terrible. Dropped in here expecting a cafe but found it to have more of a bar feel and ambiance. It s open a bit later than most cafes and seemed to have coffee and pastries. The tarts appear to be their specialty and the pecan tart was quite nice. Coffee was average. Oat flat white was a bit sour - probably from over steaming the oat milk I ve ordered dine-in food at Le Petit Perroquet twice, both times my food was completely forgotten about and I was left waiting a total of around 40 minutes between the time of ordering and actually receiving the food. On the first occasion that this happened it was quite early on a Tuesday and there were only two occupied tables in the restaurant, yet I was still left waiting for my order. When the food did arrive the portions were small and quite bland, especially considering the price point. I ve tried to contact the establishment through email to try and figure out what might have gone wrong but have not received a reply despite contacting them a month ago. Overall a really disappointing experience and absolutely would not recommend. This place is so wonderful. We popped in for coffee the other day and loved the atmosphere. As we left, we saw some sandwiches that looked amazing and decided to come back. We came back for food and it was incredible!! The tomato soup was some of the best I ve ever had. The croque monsieur was delectable. What a delightful Parisienne place in the heart of Dublin. Highly recommend. The service was terrible. Destpite the restaurant not being food it took forever for our order to be done. The waiter has also forgotten about an item we ordered which ended up taking about 50 minutes to be made which for a toasted piece of bread is a bit excessive. The waitress would also dismiss our requests. The waitress would also forget about our requests for insurance we never got our salf shaker despite asking for one 3 times. The food quality overall was not good. We ordered the chefs omlete and the vegetarian omelet. Both vere bland, accompanied by a bland unfried toast. Would not recommend sitting in. Appallingly slow service, equally poor food - not sure what ingredients comprised my broccoli soup, certainly not fresh broccoli!  Dish accompanied by cheap, warm white bread.  A great disappointment given the quality of everywhere else we ate in Dublin.  Id love to know if the two ladies sitting nearby gave up & left, as no staff approached their table during the time we were there!  Plenty of much better places, of all kinds, to eat in Dublin. French breakfast Venue in Dublin Awful service from the waiter - couldn t even get the salt and pepper right!! Food was average Food : 2/5 | Service Unfortunately the only half decent thing was the coffee The service was very slow and then they brought us out the wrong order the first time. Asked for some tap water while we waited for the right food to arrive, and were told no. Ordered a sausage, spinach, and mushroom omelette but what they eventually served was a mushroom omelette, with two barely cooked sausages on the side, and some salad. The toast was essentially a slice of bread with no butter. No one cleared our plates and when we finally caught someone s attention to ask for the bill, we were told to go up to the bar, where we paid and then noticed afterward they had added an automatic 10% tip for the two of us. Le Petit Perroquet, located in the heart of Dublin City on Wicklow Street, Dublin 2, is a delightful spot for Brunch, Lunch, and Cafe Culture enthusiasts. Open 7 days a week, this charming cafe offers both dine-in and take-out options, making it perfect for any schedule. During my visit, I indulged in their Cheese board and crackers, and I must say, it was a treat for the taste buds! The selection of cheeses was fantastic, paired perfectly with a variety of savory crackers. The attention to detail in presentation and flavors impressed me. Apart from the delicious cheese board, Le Petit Perroquet offers a wide range of fabulous pastries and cakes that are simply divine. The atmosphere inside is warm and inviting, making it an ideal spot to relax with friends or unwind on your own. Whether youre a local or a visitor exploring Dublin City, I highly recommend a visit to LPQ Wicklow Street. Their delectable offerings and cozy ambiance create an unforgettable experience. Its definitely a gem in the heart of the city. Lovely chill bar and cafe. Great for a coffee or sneaky glass of wine. Came here for lunch with my girlfriend. We each ordered an omelette and we got a baguette with butter and jam to share. The omelettes took over a half hour to come out, and when they did, they were bland and unsalted, with some pieces of plain white toast on the side. The baguette, which ended up being a small panini that was cut in half and thrown onto a plate, took a full 45-50 minutes to come to the table - and it arrived after both of us had fully finished our omelettes. We had asked for strawberry jam on the side and even that wasn t brought out, and neither was a knife to be able to spread the butter/jam. When I asked the server politely if the baguette would be coming at around the 30 minute mark, I was told they would check but she never came back to tell me why it was taking so long. Generally dismissive and neglectful staff. At the very end, when we went to pay at the till, I noticed that they had pre-included a service charge of 10%, without even being asked. I found the atmosphere to be stuffy and the tables uncomfortable as well. Overall, why would I go here when I can go to a million other better cafes with better food and service nearby? Customer service is extremely poor here. Ordered a coffee and sat outside. About 15 min later a waiter came out and took the coffee off the table (half full) and said  you re done yeah? . Told him I wasn t finished yet and he put it down and told me that he needs me to move on as he needs to make more room for other customers. His explanation was very rude. When I finished my coffee I brought my cup inside and explained that it was quite a rude approach, especially since I had only just ordered my coffee. The waiter didn t accept it and said I was there too long and he needs me to move. Won t be back - couldn t get over how rude the staff was. My 4 friends with me also ordered 5 coffees and a slice of cake, so we had ordered plenty and spend enough money to be sat there. Waiter just wanted us to leave. Charming French cafe/ bistrot, cosy authentic atmosphere, lovely service and great food Had the most disappointing coffee and pastry here with the family on a quiet Sunday morning. The staff could not be more Parisian (rude) if they tried. No seats available inside so we sat and the cramped outside tables, after ordering and paying for 3 drinks and 3 pastries. 30 minutes goes by and no sign of anything despite full view of the pastries ready on plates to come out. Eventually I went in, and said, will I take these out and she grunted acknowledgement and a yes. However Im not a professional waiter so Im never going to manage cutlery and three plates with pastries plus 3 sets of cups and saucers. So we wait, eventually the rest of the food/beverages make it out. The pain au chocolate is 5.25 and comes with the most miserable smear of chocolate, the scone a bit like a bullet and I had to go in to get butter and jam. Coffees were good but overall 25e, a bit steep, and service dire. Parking: Use the Brown Thomas car park for ease If you want to feel in Paris in the heart of Dublin, this is your spot. Cute little Parisian style cafe with everything that you need. Great coffee and cakes! On a nice day you can sit outside, looking the street and people watch The pain au chocolat was horrible - it tasted old and dry. The coffee was ok, but really not worth. VERY pricey, simply don t go. Pretty little bakery which obviously recalls Parisian bakeries. The setting is pleasant, fast service. We were even lucky enough to have a French server. The dishes are plentiful. I really liked the quiche with salad as well as the soup. The only downside is that the prices are a little high for my taste. Fabulous artisan treats. Only place I found in Dublin, where desserts were not too sweet or with toffee/fudge (no worries, there are toffee/fudge desserts as well :))) It is a small place, so I recommend takeaway. this cafe used to be so lovely, but the prices now are CRIMINAL!  6.50 for a Danish and  6 for a scone?? Where are the petit prices For expatriates temporarily lacking French baguette or French pastries. Very well done at a fair price. The place is very nicely decorated. Cutest little cafe in the heart of Dublin! The staff were super friendly and helpful and the pastries were really fresh and absolutely delicious!! Ambience is super relaxing with chilled Parisian jazz in the background, lovely way to start your day Really disappointed with their service. First visit the staff forgot to place my friend s order, second visit didn t bring my milk for the tea until I asked and took the wrong order and served my vegetarian friend a ham quiche. The soup was okayish but the sourdough bread tasted old and still. They gave us a free tart as an apology but still quite disappointed given the wonderful decor and atmosphere . We tried the scrambled eggs, which were delicious and creamy. Also the cappuccino was amazing. There was a Brazilian staff member and a guy who were helpful and polite We were asked to leave by the waiter in a quite obvious and unprofessional manner before our table finishing our coffee. A pastry was also  8.25 which should be criminalised.. Great small place with French vibes in Dublin city! Great pastry, a place to sit for a cup of coffee alone or with a friend. Definitely recommend! I suspect the cafe has changed hands as it isn t the gorgeous little French cafe anymore that I loved when visiting Dublin. Gone are the magazines & papers & now it s head banging music over a morning coffee which is a turn off  can I suggest French music to create some atmosphere! Food Its a nice little cafe but its very cramped to sit. We only came for the tarts as the food seemed overpriced. The tarts were very lovely. We had the chocolate and lemon tart. Service could be better. We were at the till about to pay when the lady at the counter started yelling at another girl that just came in for having a starbucks drinks. Obviously it was another employee but way inappropriate to react like that and especially dealing with a customer. She could have waited to say something after dealing with us. But looking from the other reviews here, thats the norm apparently. I would suggest to do takeaway. The staff is so professional; the coffee is delicious, and the atmosphere is chill. Nice place to dine alone. Honestly the best quiche and tart I have had in my life . It s made fresh.. Cute little place, lovely decoration. Nice selection of main dish and dessert. The staff could be a little more attentive. Love this spot. Great lunch deal for Dublin City centre with a sandwich, cappuccino, soup and delicious pastry for 15.95. Any of the times I ve been there, no rush to get us to leave so a perfect spot for a catch-up with friends. This place was great for breakfast pastries, but its now  5.95 for just a pain au raisin, and the quality has dropped hugely. The 10% service charge is sneaky. The coffee is decent. I had great brunch food was good and service fast. I think this place deserve better than the actual rating Ill be back Food So expensive for what you get. Quality of bakery is poor, croissant is dry. Service is okay but never get a receipt when you pay. I paid 12.50 for a croissant and coffee. We ordered two caramel macchiatos but only got two small espressos. We thought maybe they just served them small but when we were finished, we saw them serving bigger cups to everyone else. I know that he took my order properly because we had a full conversation about caramel being added to a macchiato. I also ordered an all butter crescent but got a chocolate one. When we asked for the check, he acknowledged us but then we still sat there for a while waiting on it. Finally just got up and went to the counter to pay. Overall poor experience. But the pastry was good so theres that."
118,Legit Coffee Co,4.7,"Had a great breakfast experience at Legit Coffee Co. Opting for their new Irish breakfast bap, I was not dissapointed. Lots of flavour and cooked wonderfully. To compliment my food I had a delicious salted caramel latte which was a tasty treat that was hard to beat! Coffee absolutely sublime, some of the best on offer Food: Really delicious and unique poached eggs with fab bread. Loads of great options!! The space itself is lovely Highly recommend to go and check it out for food or coffee or tea!! Incredible tasting breakfast with more unusual flavours but we loved it! Great if you fancy a healthier breakfast too. I had the greens omelette and my partner had the pulled pork Benedict and both were so delicious! The salted caramel coffee went down a treat too. Highly recommend! Cute coffee shop with tasty baked goods. Had a matcha latte and a flat white, both reasonably priced. Lots of seating inside. Would return. Great visit to this coffee shop. Polite service, great coffee and lovely pastries. Relaxed vibe with good music playing. The place is far bigger than I expected. Is in a bad looking neighbourhood but its really nice inside. The coffee is very good and the staff are very nice. Food is delicious too but tends to the expensive side, around  15 a plate. I recommend this place. Amazing food, great little hidden gem with lovely staff. Will return again. Lovely cafe that has far more seating than expected. Easy to find a quiet corner. Staff were really friendly and I really enjoyed my coffee! Didnt think the ham and cheese croissant was worth 5.50 but it filled a hole The best coffee shop in the Liberties! So lucky to have it so close to my office. The coffee is great and the treats are amazing. Especially the almond croissants. The staff are so lovely and friendly. It would be hard not to keep returning here over and over! The Eggs & Greens toast is simply amazing. Fresh ingredients & charming waiters. I don t give 5 stars for the ambiance, as the walls need to be painted soon. Apart from that, lovely lovely coffee with really tasty brunch options. Great little spot with good coffee and food. I ordered the Super Green Omelette (pictured) which was tasty and a nice addition to the menu. There are also a good selection of toasties and pastries available, I ve enjoyed the chicken, pesto, and sun-dried tomato toastie a few times. Plus, there is a lot of seating for customers who would prefer to eat in. Tucked away in a cozy spot, this coffee joint nails it. The coffee? Bold and spot-on. Pastries? A sweet, flaky indulgence. No frills, just damn good coffee and treats in a chill setting. A solid go-to for a satisfying caffeine fix. Such a cosy cafe. Perfect to relax in after a busy day in the city.  Delicious brunch and friendly staff. This cafe is lovely!! Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and usually no wait to get seated since there are lots of tables. I had the breakfast bap and it was delicious!! And a great tasting coffee with lovely art! Would recommend! I wish I found this place sooner!! Great service, the ladies working behind the counter were very kind and attentive. Lots of tables and seats, fast wifi, clean and stocked bathrooms, and a clean space overall. The mushroom melt was super good and filling, I wasnt expecting it to taste as good as it did! Would definitely recommend this spot. Amazing Coffee, the best toasted sandwiches in town and super friendly service! Also there s new kinds of homemade pastries to try pretty much every week   I can highly recommend trying the chicken pesto sandwich! Also a good variety of incredible brunch options were added recently, can t wait to try these Vegetarian options: Plenty of veggie options available Dietary restrictions: Dietary requirements are labeled clearly on t he menu Kid-friendliness: Kids seem to be very welcome here, the place is also kid appropriate Wheelchair accessibility: No step or ledge to enter the cafe The best flat white in all of Dublin trust me I tasted many!  It looks small from the street but has a back room. Staff were very friendly and I enjoyed my break from the bustle of the city. I am very impressed with the food but not really a fan of Lavazza coffee.. my first time and enjoy the food.. Great coffee and treats but one of the servers is quite impatient and had no time for some customers who were foreign to the area. Maybe just a bad day but the volume affected the experience of a cup of coffee here. Other server is very friendly as always Food here was sooooo great!!! Really really liked the choice and service. We found the portions a bit small though (probably because it is so good you would like to eat more of it) and we found the place a bit dark: feels like seating in a corridor. The atmosphere is nice though and staff super friendly. Fantastic food and service. Would highly recommend the Avocado and Eggs - Cooked to perfection . Great atmosphere as well,  right in the middle of the Liberties . Will definitely be back This place is a little gem, and unique among the myriad of coffee shops, which have sprung in Dublins inner city in the last years. It combines hipster hype with genuine empathy for the people of the Liberties, who seemingly have fully made it their place. The coffees, matcha latte, soup and veggie sandwich were also great. This will definitely be our new Saturday morning coffee place! Lovely little coffee shop just near Liberty Market. Friendliest staff, very professional and lively! I ordered gingerbread latte and blue matcha for my friend, made by the barista named Jay (Im not sure if I spelled his name right  ). Both the gingerbread latte and matcha tasted exceptional.   They use Full Circle coffee beans. Definitely recommend, and def coming back! 10/10 Really cool vibe, staff are happy and friendly. Food is TASTY, order the veggie breakfast bap if you get a chance, soo good! Delicious menu. We have eggs Benedict which were perfect. The coffee was also excellent and the children loved their hot chocolates. The staff were super friendly and really efficient. It looks very unassuming from the street but they take great care to cook fantastic food. We loved it! Beautiful food, baked goods and all around presentation. Support friendly staff and lots of great seating arrangements. This place has a great vibe, and as a visitor, I felt super welcome. Check this place out when you can!!! Nicest brunch I ve ever had in Dublin We are visiting from Florida, USA and staying around the corner at the Weavers. We found this place on our first morning and have been back every day since, several times a day! By far the best coffee we ve had in Dublin and frankly better than our coffee at home! Absolutely delicious! The pastries are amazing as well. HIGHLY recommend. Lovely spot to have lunch. The staff was very kind and thoughtful about my gluten intolerance. The athmosphere is great and the food delicious. Would recommend. Lovely coffee/tea place. Delicious sausage roll &   Lattes! Staffs are lovely and friendly! The chicken pesto sandwich was very good, not an overwhelming pesto taste. I had the filtered americano and it was delicious. Very friendly staff, but the space could be better - more comfortable and prettier. Good music ! They have filtered drip coffee here! Hard to find in Dublin. No V60, but they will make you a fresh batch brew (machine) on the spot if you can wait a few extra minutes. It will be worth it. They use high end beans. Mine was a Costa Rica with tasting notes of stone fruit lime and berries. Great coffee and matcha. Wonderful breakfast food too. Very great coffee in Dublin! Was searching for a good coffee & this did not let me down - we had no plan in mind visiting Dublin & just strolled the streets ending up in the Liberty area. Finding Legit Coffee was perfect. A great setting once you step through the doors, large area in the second room to sit & eat too. Very good, highly recommend. I stopped here for a quick breakfast. The lady at the counter greeted me with a bright smile as I came in and was really kind. I was in a hurry so I only had an almond croissant (which was good) accompanied by an Irish breakfast tea. The pastries selection looked fantastic. Excellent way to start your day. Warm and welcoming cafe in Dublin 8. The staff are warm and welcoming. They are friendly towards all the customers regardless if you re a regular or your first time in the cafe. The decor is styled lovely, rustic and creative. There are various styles of seating available and the cafe is much bigger than you d originally think. They offer various sandwiches and have different kinds of milk; dairy, oat, coconut and almond to accommodate dietary needs and taste preference. This cafe is nice for meeting friends or if you re looking for a space to draw/read/write/work. VERY tasty chemex of a  surprise  coffee. Had a fun time trying to guess and being engaged and educated by the baristas. Really tasty lunch with a well thought-out menu and great sit down time here. Service was 10/10! The baristas clearly knew how to read their audience; really enjoyed the interaction. Super atmosphe, gorgeous food and amazing staff Heard great things about this place but was disappointed. Ordered two coffees,, Danish and ham + cheese sandwich. Told they would be brought to our table. We took our seats and waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually a staff member came with the sandwich (toasted) my companion said he didnt order it toasted, the staff member became a little irate saying all sandwiches are toasted (news to us). Staff member asked where my Danish was I said I hadnt got it yet. Anyways, long story short, service is sloppy and needs improvement. Also, they have food menus hidden at the back of the restaurant, we didnt see any at the front (we would have ordered something from the menu if wed known they had one) Ill be back and give this place another try Good food, nice coffee, and pleasant staff. Very cosy space (tables at the back a bit too tight, although good enough for two people), but pleasant, and the service was fast. The pulled pork eggs benedict on brioche was really tasty; the croissant and green tea just ok (reasonably priced). Overall a nice spot to keep in mind when in the liberties."
119,Lemon Jelly Cafe,4.425,"The service was great! The two boys who took care of us were very cheerful and very helpful. The pear juices were super good! As for the pancakes, I didnt find them incredible, especially the stuffing inside... Im not sure if it was homemade. But I think I would have rated it better if I actually felt better quality products inside. But for juices I recommend!! They are fresh and succulent Weve heard alot about Lemon Jelly Cafe with everyones YouTube video and decided to visit ourselves. We were kindly greeted and seated. It was around 10am and was really busy so and that says it all really. The full Irish breakfast was lovely along with the gingerbread latte and chai latte which hit the spot for the fun packed day ahead. We did try going back the next day but was extremely busy with queues out the door. Absolutely love finding places that just invite you in. We had two buggies with us, and the staff were super to accommodate us. No fuss or come back later, just straight in and seated. Food was top notch, had a full Irish. Was delicious. Perfect spot for breakfast or brunch with your beloved ones. Service is fast and foods are delicious. I d definitely come back if my fellas and I gather around in the morning. Next time I d love to try different things. We visited for breakfast and ordered 2 smoothies, 2 mini breakfasts and a fruit bowl to share. The food was perfect and the staff were so lovely! We arrived first thing and got a table but it got very busy quickly afterwards with people waiting to be seated. I had the rustic ciabatta and a chocolate milkshake. Both were really tasty! The service was good too. Highchairs are available if bringing little ones and theres a changing table in the toilets. This is the cutest spot! We ate here two days in a row! I love the adorable cozy/clean aesthetic. They are very efficient, great service (I love the personalities of the servers) and wow the FOOD! The extensive menu has something for everyone in your group regardless of hunger level, dietary restrictions and preference. I LOVED GJE TEA! Loose leaf tea in an adorable pot? Could anything be better? They have coffee, juice, and tea galore. They have overnight oats, pancakes, omelets, crepes- sweet and savory. Very stylish menu and nice seating. We came at 10am and there was a long line however it went fast. Certainly worth the wait! The next day we came earlier and there was no wait time. The food was delish and tasted so fresh and tasty! I would certainly recommend visiting this establishment during your time in Amsterdam. Had a lovely brunch here and were lucky enough to not have to wait for a table. Great pancakes and good service. Outdoor seating available. Lovely breakfast. Myself and my friend used this as our breakfast base. I had the mini breakfast and my friend had the crepes with bacon and maple syrup. We loved this little place. The staff were lovely. Was usually busy but we still didnt have to wait too long. It was a lovely place to eat. There are so many choices that look tasty that it was very hard to choose! From a full Irish breakfast to crepes, omelettes, bagels, toasts, french toasts, smoothies, fruit juice, coffees with various milk options and teas, it was wonderful.  We appreciated the vegetarian version of the Irish breakfast for those who prefer. We had a bit of everything and everyone loved their food. Special note for the turmeric coconut latte, which I liked very much. The strawberry hot chocolate is the only thing we cared less for due to a more industrial strawberry sirup taste. Other dishes we tried : matcha latte, fruit juice, french toast, cream cheese bagel, camomille tea, full Irish breakfast, vegetarian full Irish breakfast. The personnel was nice, the food arrived quickly ans was quite generous in size, the space was nice. Wed love to come back there to try all the other tasty looking dishes. Vegetarian options: They had many vegetarian dishes, including one for the full Irish breakfast. The food was very good and service was excellent. The lattes were immaculate. Fabulous friendly staff. Professional friendly atmosphere. Great scenery. Food was delicious and beautifully presented. Food We had an excellent breakfast here from English to croissant, coffee and tea very good and the service was pleasant and fast We got an Irish breakfast, crepe with strawberries, mocha and green tea. I was quite disappointed than there was no ice scream on any available crepes. Service was fast. It is good place to stop by if around. We had a very enjoyable experience at your Cafe today. We were served by Emma. She was so attentive,friendly and funny. Her interaction with my grandson was adorable. We left with a wonderful impression of the place. We will definitely be back. The food was beautiful too! Food was okay, nothing too fancy. Good place to try Irish breakfast. I think that there was nothing unique about the cafe. I went at a very busy time after the parade. Fortunately, I can be guided by staff. Because it was time about 2pm, I ordered Velvet crepe and hot lette. It was not anything special Ive ever eaten, but it was a place enough to tea time. I know that time was very busy.. but I felt that one man staff hinted to wake up. So I reduced 2point at service. I head the Irish Breakfast. It was good but I wish it came out hotter. Sausages were excellent. I was attracted to this cafe for its look and also because the first time I passed by it was packed. I came back the next day and had a chicken and cheddar omelette made to perfection, with a couple toast and butter so that was my lunch. They have an extensive menu and everything I saw around me looked just yummy, but I was too full to have dessert. The staff was friendly and I also liked that they have an open kitchen and you can see while they cook. All in all I think they offer good value for money and the place is pleasant to be in. Lovely little gem of a place in Dublin. The food was amazing and the service was very quick. Even though they were busy, every staff member we encountered was so lovely. Great vegan options, and probably the nicest iced coffee weve ever had. A must try! Best place for Irish breakfast and the crepes are absolutely delicious, the staff are very friendly and helpful, I always recommend this place to everyone cause I know they ll have the best time, it s fabulous. The atmosphere of the place is amazing. Excellent coffee and food. Smoothies always needed on spring and summer time. I was unfortunately disappointing. While the coffee is tasty, the prices were a bit on the higher side for what was offered. Moreover, the background noise was quite loud, making it difficult to enjoy a peaceful drink  or conversation. To add to the frustration, the staff seemed rather annoying and inattentive, detracting from the overall experience. On a recent visit to Lemon Jelly Cafe, we were treated to an undeniably delicious breakfast experience. The cafes English Breakfast and crepes were simply delightful, expertly prepared, and served in a way that has forever defined how perfect a morning meal should be. I am compelled to mention their banana shake, an absolute explosion of fresh, creamy banana goodness, and one of the best Ive ever had. Notably, their almond croissant stood out - it was divine, boasting a perfect balance of fluffiness and crunch, with a generous layer of almonds with a pinch of cinnamon adding an irresistible touch. While the quality of food and service are beyond compare, be prepared for the possibility of a wait. The cafes demand often results in a queue, particularly during peak hours. Despite this, I assure you that the wait is very much worth it!!! A nice place where you can enjoy drinking or eating with friends. We tasted the cheesecake that was not as we expected. However, the monkey business was so delicious. Besides, the coffees that we drank were spectacular as well, above all the pictures on the top. I would recommend this cafe. This cafe was lovely, its animal friendly, has great service, and the food is brilliant. Highly recommend :) Nice spot to share a good time with your friends, I ordered the special lunch, which includes One Panino, soup of the day (you can ask which one they have), and one drink or coffee (plant based with extra cost). Thank your for the food Such an amazing breakfast! Loved it ! Great service ! Great staff ! Friendly atmosphere We went on the bank holiday weekend. We waited about 30 minutes for our food and about 25 minutes to be seated. It was a long wait but the food was lovely. The French toast was amazing, The vege breakfast and good and so was the avocado on bread ( you only get one slice though) . If you are really hungry I would say none of it would really fill you up but we were fine as we got 3 things to share between 2 wont fill you up. Everything was lovely but the long wait was really off putting. Service was great aswell Absolutely lovely place. Breakfast was delicious   staff were so helpful, views were good too x thanks you Lovely food. Nice atmosphere. Good service. Visited for strawberry and mascarpone crepes (8 euros) but was disappointed. Crepes were tasteless, dry, and served in a small portion, not worth the price. The coffee in this place however is awesome. Nice food, good portion. Good vartions for lunch and breakfast. Nice servers Very busy, often lines outside to get in. Might need to wait from 5-40 minutes for a table. Also sitting inside by the door will leave you feeling cold throughout dining. Good food, nice service. Americano was so good Food This place was great. The staff is super friendly.  One waiter(manager?) actually went and printed a map and marked it with day hiking trips for Me.   The guy who seats everyone(Latino?) in am, remembers you and greats you like a long time customer. He is always checking to make sure your taken care off. The food is plentiful, cheap and the menu is large. It s on a big walkway so great people watching at outdoor tables or window seats. Great homey place. Its Sunday morning at 930 am and this place is hopping. Great place for breakfast or lunch. I had the vegiterian Irish breakfast comprised of beans, eggs, toast, mushrooms and tomatoes. The omlette was very good and not dried out, but the best was the orange hot chocolate. Service was fast and friendly. Washrooms were  clean and looked after. The restaurant was worth visiting again. The Baileys hot chocolate and Irish coffee were good, but not the best Ive had. Too bad. breakfast came cold, everything was cold. I asked the attendant who was super friendly. took breakfast to The Restaurant is a few meters from the river on D1. It is a restaurant with typical Irish food, although they also offer other dishes. The experience was very good, the attention cordial, the food delicious and the fruit smoothies incredible. It is definitely a place that you can not miss if you are in Dublin. Really nice cafe with great service. The food is delivered really fast. We had the Vegetarian breakfast and Full Irish breakfast and washed it down with Turmeric Coconut Latte. It was delicious."
120,Like A Coffee,4.5,"Cute location next to the bridge, the drinks are expensive and the cold coffees don t come with lids. I got a iced caramel macchiato and my partner got a caramel frappe. They were both pretty good and very sweet! 4 stars for the pretty location and lots of good seating options. Went here for a quick break after walking through the city. Definitely a nice spot by the river to sit down and have a quick drink or snack. I had the caramel frappe but it was unfortunately way too sweet, felt like I was drinking straight caramel syrup - also very expensive so I don t think it was worth it. Small riverside outside seating cafe across from Arlington hotel. Nice to sit and watch the river flow by with a cappuccino Great spot, glad we found it. Came back a couple of times during our 3 day visit to Dublin. Great coffee, better than big brands you find on every corner. Also my partner said it was the best hot chocolate shes ever had! (And shes had a lot) Good coffee and if you want light milk    he has it Very nice spot for a coffee, just by the river A++ great location, especially on a sunny day. excellent tho expensive coffee. Barista has some attitude issues so its fine so long as you dont mind a bit of mild rudeness. very relaxing!!! Really nice cappuccino made with my favourite oat milk, super friendly and welcoming owner, and a wonderful location overlooking the Liffey and the Hapenny Bridge: What more can a tired one ask for to be revived again?! Beautiful location right next to the river, amazing for a sunny day. However, the coffe was really really bad and very expensive for what it was. A coffee van on the boardwalk overlooking the River Liffey. A welcome al fresco break from the busy footpath just down from O Connell s Bridge. Good coffee & Byron Bay cookies from Aus. Perfect spot to drink a coffee when you walk around a city with a lovely whether and is open now and you can sit in, not only take away, yupi Best place for coffee in this city! Such tasty coffee and convenient location Friendly staff :) Coffee is fine. Location right next to the river is even better! Nice place to chill out beside river with cup of coffee due summer time. Just Cash. Good The best coofee! A wonderful place with wonderful peoples, Tried Hazelnut latte  loved it Lovely place for a coffee with with view Friendly staff!!! Super Great mochas are made here. Plus right on the river. Good service nice coffee friendly staff Very rude bar attendant Always call by... If its sunny!!!!! Comfortable and very pleasant in nice weather Nicest place to have a coffee in Dublin? Always good coffee! Fav spot Love Nice airy place Excelent Ok Excellent O melhor e a localizacao. Cookie achei sem gosto e o iced caramel latte parecia um cafe com leite forte e gelo. nan nan nan nan nan nan"
121,Luke Kelly Sculpture,4.5,"A beautiful artwork in an unexpected location. Yet there is method in the madness as the rustic industrial feeling of the statue is echoed in the background with a hulking rusting ancient Victorian creation over the water. The hair/beard as metal wires further reinforces this theme. Theres over 270 statutes dotted across Dublin. This is my favourite and Im sure loads of other folks favourites. The reason is that it reflects its environment & also the expression on Lukes face. Too many public artworks of notable people have them with either neutral facial expression or a gentle smile. This is Luke in the throngs of singing his soul out. It brings it alive in a deep meaningful way. The statue was designed by Vera Klute and is circa 220 cm x 170 cm x 170 cm excluding the stone base. Treated marble was used for the formation of the head while treated metal wire was used to form the hair and beard. The hair is attached through the use of a metal mesh wig while the moustache is made of individual pieces of wire which were drilled into the face of the statue. An initial model with hair was made in smaller near life sized form. A secondary larger statue was then created from plaster but without hair. This second statue was then used for 3D scanning to create the final larger sized version replicated in marble via a 5-axis cnc milling machine in Italy. The appearance is based on a distinctive pose of Luke Kelly with his eyes closed while performing and is said to be taken from a still from his performance of Scorn Not His Simplicity on a show hosted by Jim McCann in 1974 called McCann Man. The statue is said to have cost Dublin City Council  80,000. Beautiful statue of our true  legendary folk friend,beautiful music was made by thus man Loved seeing this sculpture of Luke but such a pity about its location, placed alongside a heavily trafficked road far from the city center, such a shame. Understandably it was relocated due to defamation but this current spot is pretty absurd. Luke Kelly deserves so much better! Horrible looking sculpture in my opinion very strange pose. I would be rushing to see it. Legend We will  never see the likes of him again. Nice Amazing art, man and area of Dublin. Gwan the Sheriffer Irish love their people It looks amazing! It has been vandalised by some idiots about several times and now it has been restored. Theyll have to make sure that nobody would ever vandalise it again. Anyway god bless that poor old bloke Luke Kelly. It was so sad that he passed away in 1984. Im sure he was a great musician. He might be gone but not forgotten and he would be sadly missed. This as you know is the luke Kelly statue facing st Larurence otools church in sheriff street via the new Canal. Royal Canal Dock Greenway. Brand new open. And can take you to walk to. The north strand, newcomer bridge on the north strand. From the statue on to the canal. Its such a quicker way to get you to the north strand. Via Fairview park. Or on the the rest of the Royal Canal Dock also quicker to the Canal on to Croke park stadium .and on to. Dorset st. And on up the canal to. The phisboro. And back the best way. Mush quicker both ways. Cycle track Availability also. Please enjoy and welcome to our Canal connection. Over Samuel Beckett bridge. And on the the grand Canal Dock.  Its a beautiful walkway and cycle way to Enjoy.  If you had to get these ways before. You would have to go through the city centre to get to these both places. And would have taken you at least 2 to 3 hours to get from. A to b . Before. But now to the fantastic new way. You will do it in a halfway.  Takes only about. From A to b. In about a 15 to 20 minutes now. Its a great way open. And much quicker.  Love it. Great job. Cost only the city council a miserly Impressive statute if youre heading out that way. Its very big and makes for a fun tourist photo. Since we were in this side of Dublin we decided that it would be a shame not to have a quick gander at Dublin s newest statute, a Luke Kelly sculpture situated just across the bridge on the edge of Guild Street and Sheriff Street, to mark the 35th anniversary of his death. (Died in 1984 of a brain tumour aged just 43). Luke was born into a working-class household in Sheriff Street, in 1940. Luke Kelly, with his very distinctive singing style, was a quintessential Dublin singer, folk musician, and social activist, and a hero and all round Irish legend to many. Luke, of course, was a prominent member of The Dubliners, the Irish trad specialists, whose versions of Irish classics like  The Rocky Road to Dublin ,  Seven Drunken Nights ,  The Town I Loved So Well ,  On Raglan Road  enthralled millions of people not just in Ireland but all across the world, a folk singer that will forever be remembered. Designed by German born but Dublin based artist, Vera Klute, the sculpture is quite distinctive and definitely stands out, showing a big curly red head and bearded Luke on display for the whole world to see. Eye catching, just like Luke Kelly was, that being the point I guess! It s quite big and I have to say it s a great piece of artistic work, getting Kelly s facial expressions down to a tee. Hats off to Vera Klute, this is an excellent sculpture and one that the people of the Northside can be proud of. But wait a minute, the statue was apparently vandalized with graffiti just a few weeks after its unveiling! No one knows why but I was thinking perhaps it might be that the statue is really not in the heart of Sheriff Street but just across the bridge on the edge of the area he was from, and nearer to the nicer part of the town? Walking straight across the bridge to the statue one can be in no doubt that you are walking across a social divide, at least that was the impression I got, and not so much a gift to the local people but something for the tourists to gawk at and then promptly turn right around least they venture too close to the centre of Sheriff Street. Or maybe I am putting too much into that Anyway, thankfully the graffiti was removed and the statue was restored in all its glory by the time we had a look. You must visit to really appreciate a fantastic work of art. Brilliant depiction of a wonderful performer - the eyes and mouth made me raise my ear waiting to hear Raglan Road or the like!! It makes the look of the area picturesque, especially Spencer Dock where I live. But its not a tourist spot as people confuse. Its just a statue. Very famous classic Irish musician dated back to the 80s. Well worth a look if you are near by. Very good design and placed nicely beside the canal just off sheriff street. Like the statue itself the location is where new dublin meets old dublin. Plenty around as well from shops to restaurants and even a boat restaurant a short walk up the quays, so a trip here will not be waisted with loads to do and see within walking distance of the statue. Nice sculpture. Hard to rate this as a location though. Its just a sculpture sort of in the middle of nothing else going on. Very strong symbol of Irish musical culture but as a location theres not much going on. A fitting tribute to the great man It looks fantastic---this piece of memorial art-work---showing that it is possible to achieve greatness no matter where you come from----given the continual GARDA presence in the area---most citizens living here make a greater effort to make  their  choice in rearing their children in this area. A big head Truly is a work of art. It takes a very special artist to deliver at most a very challenging work where the end result is just magnificent. It is simply stunning and captivates the man, the legend, so well. Awesome guys they are. Thx a mil Mark for all your help, really appreciate your teaching and the good craic we had! Lovely to see. Glad he is being looked after now. Much nicer up close. Photos dont do it justice. Day out walking with my cousin and found Luke on way to get the lusas home. Took some photos which I sent to my brother in Australia. Big Luke Kelly fan. The statue itself is pretty incredible. The river is lives beside is atrocious! Tyres, industrial trollies, skateboards and traffic cones! Place is a disgrace! Statue erected to commemorate the 35th anniversary of Luke Kelly s death, (1940 - 1984) irish singer, folk musician and actor from Dublin. It is a sculpture of the artist head made from marble with the hair represented through coiled metal. No offense, but I thought I was looking at Bob Ross when I first saw the sculpture Omg driving past this famous .so calld portrait.loks hidious and lost lokn againts the back area..surely luke cuda been.placed on. Quays down.past or up along side  famine figures..lol luke loks lost lol:) Striking sculpture by Vera Klute that will never be mistaken for anyone else. Location at the intersection of historic and modern Dublin is fitting for Luke Kelly s musical legacy. A fitting tribute to one of Irelands greatest traditional performers, a fabulous entertainer and singer Lovely tribute to the great man himself its not a statue but its still a great reminder of the legend that was Luke Kelly Beautiful statue and the surrounding area is equally amazing, would definitely recommend especially to any fans of Luke Kelly A great likeness to a great Dubliner. Pity about the thugs who mindlessly keep coming back to ruin this lovely piece of art. Great sculpture by Vera Klute, a very talented sculptor and painter, would recommend seeing any of exhibition of Klutes work Big Irish Head - RIP Luke Awesome,  time to time the statue appears dirty today its finally clean. Is beautiful! The citys second sculpture was created by one of Irelands most prominent figurative sculptors, John Coll, who also created a statue of Patrick Kavanagh, who wrote On Raglan Road. This life-size bronze featuring Kelly singing and playing banjo is on South King Street. Had to look him up and wow he was good. Very historic part of Dublin and a nice piece of art work. A must see when visiting Dublin. This is a wonderful statue and gives a real feeling of the vibrancy of Luke Kelly."
122,M&S Cafe,2.8,"I really wouldnt bother going. From the cappuccino half froth,to a burnt tea cake,and I do mean burnt. The two members of staff serving at the till on the roof cafe had the most SOUR faces on them I have EVER seen. It gave me the impression they hate their job.They would turn the milk off in your coffee. What a disappointment and a waste of my money.. Im a little looth to share this place as its a hidden gem in Grafton Street.Dublin.Its my go to place for a quiet bite to eat either lunch of coffee & a snack for a chat. So enjoy the vista in this glass penthouse on the roof area of M & S Dublin. Marty Nicer and quieter than a busy coffee shop with a nice outdoor terrace. Food and service average, not the most welcoming staff. Recommended for a coffee to relax from a morning of exploring. Nice coffee. Prices are on par with high street coffee chains. Located at the top of the M&S store. V disappointing, nothing much on offer & pot of tea & cup where like for kids tiny. This was our 2nd time trying this place the last time we were there for breakfast they had run out of rashers despite there being a food hall on the lower ground floor...  wouldnt be rushing back. Absolute rip off. A dry, bland sandwich cut into tiny triangles for  7.50. Very limited food options. A man in front of me, also queuing for a long time, ordered a breakfast which was on the menu, only to be told there was no breakfast. I would have left when I saw the price of the sandwich but was with my Mam who was already seated at a table. The queue was very long with only one till open. The upside is that there is usually a table available and the outdoor terrace is nice during warm weather. I would avoid unless just going for coffee. Quite expensive which is normal for a Grafton street location. Food selection is good but not extensive. Portion sizes are small for the prices. Nice outdoor area when the weather permits. Could do with some more toilet facilities as long queues form at busier times. Staff are polite. Worth a visit, although there are better places around the area. Lovely cafe.Decent choice of foods available. Allways great coffee made here on roof top .Try it. Food Rudest staff not even interested enough to say hi or thanks. Would NEVER come back. I never met such uninterested people in a group in all my life Chicken pot pie.. Excellent.. But my female companion had to queue for 15 minutes to use 1 and only ladies toilet. It was nice , good selection . Staff kept disappearing from checkouts and floor . It was very busy as it was Saturday  about 12:30 ., definitely  could of done with extra staff . Very nice atmosphere, it is actually so cool to have your coffee on a rooftop overlooking the beautiful streets of Dublin. So if you re takin a break here s your perfect pitstop. I had breakfast here yesterday. The big breakfast comes with no tea or coffee this is extra. The food was terrible sausages so over cooked were inedible potatoes were cold as were the beans. The bacon and toast were the only nice thing on the plate. The tea was luckwarm. The restaurant it self was not clean. Dirty tables and floor. This was a waste of 17 euro. Much better breakfasts in other places. I m gonna share my experience with yall, I went there with some friends, we were looking forward to go this place  is a rooftop, but u cant stay in the balcony. We ask if we could sit there the staff was so rude, when I ordered my coffee the barista that was making was so rude to all of us, she was also chewing gum with her mouth open, guess how much of saliva wasn t falling into the drinks. I now that working in retail and hospitality can be hard, but u should a least treat others  with respect, you not doin me a favor Im paying for the service. I don t know what personal struggles u dealing with but don t project in your costumer s. I wont recommend this place, if u reading this u can find more pleasant places to go in. Need more staff and the selection of sandwiches was poor. There is no excuse for the latter as there is an excellent selection in the food hall. Had lunch here for the first time, and it was great. Chicken ciabatta & falafal & halloumi wrap was ordered, and it was fantastic, tea and coffee too. It is located on the 3rd floor and a lift is available. Plenty on offer for lunch and prices are a little above normal, but quality shines through. Toilets available and Cafe is suitable for all. Will go back as I enjoyed the visit. Its a really nice cafe with a good vibe. The rooftop is great for sunny days. Although the food is at best average, the coffee is nice. PS: They dont have a charging point so you cant charge your phones or laptops and work from here. Visited in May. While the venue holds promise, my experience left me underwhelmed. The coffee fell short of expectations, service lacked warmth, and an overall sense of cleanliness was amiss. Unfortunately, the terrace failed to captivate due to ongoing construction, and the glass windows dividing it from the indoor space were notably unclean. Its regrettable, as I usually appreciate what M&S establishments have to offer. No-one knows how to make a good coffee. We ordered a cappuccino and latte and for both, the milk was boiling before they pured it in the cups. The table we chose had dishes and dirt all over and noone came to clean it up. We ended up just getting the cleaner and towels from their cart ourselves to clean the table. AC was on at high volume and it was colder in the cafe than outside on a rainy day. 3 stars because although the food was okay and the staff were pleasant at best, the place was absolutely filthy. Food and litter strewn across the floor and chairs and tables. Do restaurant staff not clean up in this country? Not the first experience of an absolutely filthy restaurant area with staff that have no intention of cleaning it up at all during the day. I don t really understand it. Long queue.  Expensive. Not enough staff. Great views from roof top terrace but not sure I would go back. Absolutely appalled by the rude service. When card machine wouldn t tap I was barked at multiple times saying I didn t have enough money in my bank account and I needed to get some cash somehow. Turned out the tap function wasn t working in the entire store. Ordered eggs Benedict which came with a cold piece of ham. Will not be back. Had coffee scone jam and tub of cream for only 6 euro well worth going to Nice food and seating area was lovely or you could sit outside with a nice view from the roof tops Great views, shame the Wifi speed is disappointing, and haven t spotted any plugs either This cafe changed its menu which is a pity, they now basically serve what you can buy in the store downstairs. However the seating is nice and the coffee is ok. Its a good place to stop on from a quick bite but not somewhere to go for a meal. A long time since I went into an M&S cafe, and this is nothing special. Ordered a cheese and ham toastie - greasy and delivered without cutlery or napkins. Expensive too. Theres a roof terrace but you have to deal with seagulls. Not very enjoyable. Nice place but not the best Eggs Benedict in Dublin and it s very messy inside. Could be still good for families with kids since I saw so many options for them in terms of food. I brought a group of 11 friends because it said rooftop, but when we got there, the rooftop area was closed! We were so disappointed that we didn t even consume. Till staff must have had a bad day this morning. Not a nice person at all and we all felt unwelcome. Got my order wrong too. Then they ran out of oat milk. If they got my order right they would have enough oat milk to complete my order but I had to compromise and get normal milk even though I paid for oat. No offer to heat up the scones. One of the coffees spilled on the saucer but the staff didnt care much. Bad experience from start to finish. Will not return. Plenty of cafes around Grafton with nice and competent personnel. It was the worst breakfast i have ever had. I went for toast with beans and pouched eggs. The food was left on the pass for about 10 minutes to go cold. The egg yoke was rock hard and the beans had all stuck together. They get you up there by saying it has amazing view, dont be fooled by this as the view is not all that. I was very underwhelmed. So overpriced. Kids offering was terrible. Food selection was extremely limited..had run out of most items, just had egg and cress or ham some sandwich for  7... Coffee below average. Tables and floors were dirty. Will never return. We decided to visit the building since it said Rooftop so we expected to have the view of Grafton Street, once we arrived the waitress said that area was closed so we were not allowed to be there. Nice place for coffee and a sandwich. There is seating out doors. Im not sure its wheel chair accessible as the elevator only goes to the 3rd floor with and escalator taking you up to the 4th floor. Good selection of sandwiches, coffees and fruit. Very sad little cafe, used to be nice but has changed and not for the better. Visited on Bank holiday Mon, not much choice, nothing left! What I did get was sad an uninteresting, plenty of other better coffee shops around Grafton st to visit, for company that prides itself on it food, very poor show. The place is absolutely filthy, arrived 5 minutes before opening time and got barked at saying we were too early. Shame as you always believe M&S is quality. Although yesterday was a sunny day but not quite warm enough to eat outside but on reflection outside was warmer than inside. The A/C was far too cold and resulted in a shortened stay. Food Nice airy space with outdoor dining. Good selection of Cafe food, and drink. The selection of wines not too extensive, but adequate nonetheless. A favourite rendezvous with shoppers, and tourists needing refreshments. Food Bright and airy roof top cafe in the heart of the city. Great place for a meet up or for a break while shopping. Quality cafe food, soup, sandwiches etc. Unexpectedly pleasant views over the fine architecture of the buildings lining the street when dining on the outdoor roof terrace area. (But if you choose to dine outdoors you must remain vigilant as food raids by local herring gulls are a real possibility. These gulls are a highly protected species so you are pretty much limited to saying Shoo ) Good food here, but what really made the place stand out was a kind gentleman working there who gave my two year old son his pancake with a little dance and gave us colouring pages as we were leaving, all with a big smile!"
123,Meghan's Cafe,3.676470588235294,"Mouldy tourist trap. I was served a mouldy eclair here, staff gave a refund for the eclair but not for the rest of the items I ordered. No explanation or apology was offered either. They offered a replacement cake but I didn t touch it, god knows what condition the rest of the food is in. The coffee shop is nicely located in Temple Bar and there  is a nice outdoor seating space too. The coffee was okay, but the music was too loud, even outside, which is a bit of a shame as it ruins the overall atmosphere of the place. Would prefer quieter coffee places that are numerous in the area in the future. Friendly staff! We just got coffee s but the pastries, deserts, and sandwiches looked lovley. Bear in mind that the location is temple bar- and like most cafes in general it s kept going which is great. We got 1 cappuccino and 1 flat white- but the flat white ended up exactly same size and texture of the cappuccino. Anyways it was actually really nice so I didn t even mind.  Maybe coffee could be a tiny bit stronger. But always great when we go there. Nice quiet coffee bar, which in Temple Bar is a feat.  Coffee was nice, Cheese toastie too.  Followed up with a very yummy warm chocolate muffin.  Just a pleasant oasis of calm in a busy part of Dublin. worst experience in my whole life, we waited 15 minutes to be served. my friend ordered a caramel macchiato and was SO small like an espresso. I ordered a mocha and it was not mix and there were chocolate powder at the bottom of the cup. I DONT RECOMMEND !!!!!! I went for a chicken and avocado sandwich, followed by flat white and chocolate croissant. Both the staff and the food were amazing, very recommended and little break or wind down end of day. Food We were delighted to discover this new French style Cafe-bakery in the very centre of the temple Bar area. Delicious cakes and pastries, nice sandwiches and decent prices. ( Coffee +cake for 6 euro). Very friendly staff and amazing decor+ late opening hours is a plus. I simply popped in for a quick dessert after supper at a pub. Grabbed a shortbread base caramel Square to go which was served warm. Stopped-me-in-my-tracks-delicious. Staff were attentive and friendly. I ll be back. Lovely coffee shop around temple bar. For relaxing and lovely staff Went there on a Saturday morning. Let me tell you this is not the kind of place to wind down while sipping your coffee, I found the place to be the opposite of the quiet French bakery it is supposed to be.  Coffee was nice enough but you can find much quieter places in the area to enjoy your coffee (KC peach up road is an example) My first trip to dublin,   lovely coffee shop around temple bar,l like the coffee  and music also     back again Stopped in for dessert. The Macaroons were actually good. Ice cream was average. Kind of a touristy trap shop. Excellent experience, croissant and americano best Ive had in Dublin for our weekend away. A lovely newish Cafe in Temple Bar. French style cakes and pastries, great coffee, friendly and generous staff and lovely decor. Open later than most cafes, which is a bonus. a lovely atmosphere for breakfast this morning & very friendly staff lovely coffe shop around temple bar meghans cafe The staff are very friendly but I watched a man that looks like the owner screening at his staff in a very abuse way. Very rude and an awkward situation. I will never come back Its hard to relax in there, I dont like the mood of this cafe. And the pain au chocolat was not good, very dry. Cake was not that good, a little bit noisy. Nice coffee cappuccino in una mug, senza schiuma e col cioccolato a scaglie. La Briosches (Dio porco) me la son dovuta riempire con la marmellata col coltello. (6,60 ) Wheelchair accessibility: ahah, non e vero XD Super nette & freundliche Bedienung, alles sehr sauber, gute Preise, schones und leckeres Angebot, 3 min zu Fuss bis zum RAMMSTEIN-Shop   , mitten in der Altstadt von Dublin, sehr zu empfehlen. Vegetarian options: Kuchen und Sandwiches vegetarisch auch zur Auswahl. Wheelchair accessibility: Problemlos mit Rollstuhl moglich. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan"
124,Metro Cafe,3.925,"We had breakfast in this cafe and it was a pleasant surprise! The service was impeccable and very pleasant, the place is friendly and we enjoyed it. The waiter was very friendly, with whom we were able to speak a lot in French. I recommend this place Excellent pancakes!! That s really what I remember, as well as the very nice servers. All very smiling and helpful! There was a small problem with my order but it was immediately rectified by the server. THANKS. The only downside, if I may say so, is in terms of cleanliness... its a bit like in a bar, in some places its a little sticky, and there were hairs on the bench, my especially haunting at the table. To improve the establishment I would put more effort into ensuring that the place is perfect at this level. In any case, I recommend. Had a soup and a ham and cheese sambo with a cup of soup . The bread was very soft but hardly toasted , cheese was barely melted. The soup was carrot and coriander   wasn t tasty unfortunately. Coffee and hot chocolate were great !! I have to wait 10 minutes before to order, I saw customers leaving after waiting as well and wasn t busy at all. Food is not amazing but is fine for a simple breakfast. I think the vibe of the place is the best thing of this restaurant. Tiny space with way too many tables, we could barely move. Also, tables were too low for us. We both got the pancakes, which were average. Paid by cash and did not get our change. Add to ask for it when leaving! Very unpleasant experience. Breakfast menu very good, recommend the buttie - coffee also very nice. Service prompt. Only major complaint is that music was being blared from speakers directly above the outdoor seating area 24/7, too loud to have a conversation. It was such a nice place. The food and the service were good and also the table where we ate looked beautiful. We ate breakfast there but the lunch etc. is probably nice too :) Favorite breakfast in the city centre! A must stop for all.. pancakes with honey butter are delish! Really good spot for an all day breakfast. Our order for lost in the system so we had to wear a little longer than expected. They were very kind though and gave us free coffees to make up for any delay. I would definitely go back if I was on the lookout for a late breakfast. The breakfast buttie is sensational. Very surprised by this place which doesnt look like much but which was really very good with excellent value for money. The dishes were generous and very well made, served quickly. I recommend for lunch Absolutely gorgeous food. Perfect coffee. Beautiful cafe. Amazing atmosphere. Kind and considerate staff. 100% recommend if you re willing to wait. Empty plates speak for themselves. Unfortunately not a great experience. Ordered a bap with pesto and mozzarella. Got two tiny end slices froma mozzarella ball in my bap and a tone of pesto which was sickly. Not worth 10 , not even kind of... The place has its specific atmosphere of busy Dublin life which I wouldnt mind if the food was at least decent. Service is lovely, but stressed out which is not their fault considering how busy it is ! Felt like a true Parisian bistro cafe and loved the atmosphere. Food wasn t brilliant (the scrambled eggs were rubbery and dry) but otherwise would recommend as a nice place for breakfast. The pancakes looked great. Food : 3/5 The BBQ Nachos were divine with the best amount of cheese, guac and cream! We had the salt and caramel cheesecake which was one of the best I had Best vibes on a Saturday evening! We went for brunch today after so many months of not dining here and were disappointed with the dining experience. First, they have gotten rid of the metro special which is usually our go to order. My friends ordered the pancakes and added extra sides such as scrambled eggs and streaky bacon which mimics the metro special. One of the pancakes they served him was burnt.  I ordered the chicken and chorizo jambalaya which caught my attention as its quite new on the revamped menu. I was disappointed when it arrived as it didn t look appetizing at all and is something that I think I can easily do in my kitchen. Will probably not be back for a long while and prefer to go somewhere else for brunch. Reviews definitely do it justice. Super cute. Affordable and all the food tasted amazing. Food is average, coffee is good, staff are always lovely and the atmosphere is great, expecially sitting outside on a sunny day , which unfortunately doesnt happy very often in Eirinn Excellent place to have a magnificent lunch. Been coming here for years and I can only tell you what one thing on the menu is like - The Breakfast Buttie! It s perfection. It s a monster! Staff are always friendly even when it s busy. Not bad food value for money service was very good however, I feel the cleaneness lets it down The closest youll get to a French cafe for brunch in Dublin, with an Irish twist of course! Superb! The time before this isnt worth mentioning because the pancakes tasted as though they were just heated up in the microwave. Disappointing. This time though, the pancakes with bacon were astounding! Hot so the butter melted, loads of Golden syrup available to use and the price was great for what I got! Simply delicious! Best coffee Never had so good mocha in long time well blended. Also with Delicious Danish pastries! Great ambience with a genuine neighborhood feel even though its right in the heart of tourist Dublin.  Food was okay but good value.  Great option to sit outside and people watch with outside heaters to keep you warm on brisk winter nights.  But the inside also has a lot to offer with a warm welcoming ambience.  For a tiny place, Metro Cafe does pack in a lot! Nice little cafe close to St. Stephen s. First time went in for a quick coffee in the late evening and second time went in for dinner. Love the chill atmosphere and staff always very friendly. Love their house spiced wedges. Danish pastry was delicious-the best wev ever had 9.5/10. Ciabatta sandwiches were light and crunchy and service was very friendly would highly recommend Metro cafe for lunch. I love this place, wonderful atmosphere and great food. Im always happy leaving. The pancakes are always wonderful. Lovely cafe with outdoor seating in the heart of Dublin. Close to Grafton street and St Stephens Green. We had mixed olives as a starter, combo of soup (tomato bisque) and a vegan sandwich (veggies and hummus) , a vegan ragu with lentils, sweet potato and cous cous with curry and coconut milk, 2 coffees and sparkling water. Great place. Cake loaves are magical. The chai is delicious. Everything was very good. Very warm welcome from the servers. I highly recommend. Had the eggs and toast and the toast had clearly been out the toaster for a while and was hard and dry. My friend had the same issue. Also the restaurant is very dark and dingy! Would not recommend Had the creme mushroom soup and toast. The soup had too much salt and the toast was burnt. The waiter has some way to improve on service. Bottom line - dont order any food! Had my lunch/brunch here today. OMG!!! Outside of America, I have never had such a divine brunch. I ordered the  freshly squeezed orange juice  , which in lots of places is from concentrate. What I got was orange juice that was freshly squeezed only AFTER I ordered it... the taste was exquisite. Then the pancakes were totally homemade... with maple syrup, the eggs were fabulous, and the streaky American bacon was crispy. It took me just 13 minutes to Hoover it up. 20/10 guys. You rock!!! It s worth it to take the bus there and back, to just have that meal again. Horrible customer service. The waitress refused to give us a table despite having multiple available options and was so rude we had to leave. Decent coffee and tuna melt was okay. Perfect place to eat in Dublin and great prices to boot. Great sandwiches and lunchtime menu on the go Vegetarian options: Limited but there and tasty So I have given this a five stars across the board based on the brunch we had, and the value, quality and service we experienced. We had brunch for two, lovely coffee, great pastry and pancakes. The food was very prompt and the service was fantastic. Given the location its surprisingly not an arm and a leg cost wise. Decor is simple, no frills, but very clean and tidy. Its a great spot for a quick bite. Enjoyed my first taste of Irish food here. Really enjoyed the the food, coffee, atmosphere & staff were friendly. I did however feel it was a bit expensive, but I came to understand that Dublin generally is. Modern cafe situated near St Stephens green is literally unpassable. It has a superb brunch and lunch menu And the portions are enormous. The staff is very friendly and caters to your needs. I ordered chicken caesar salad and asked them to chop up the lettuce finely which came as I expected. It was extremely filling and the taste was absolutely delectable. I shall recommend any tourists and passers-by to try something here. Please be aware it is extremely busy most of the times. Bon Appetit !! I had a delicious breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage, tomatoes and pancakes. Only the eggs lacked a bit of seasoning for my taste but otherwise it was very tasty and well made and beautifully presented on the plate. I liked the cosy classic decor as well severely lacking menu, eggs n toast are daylight robbery served w literal packets of butter directly on top of the eggs. Breakfast buttie and pancakes are only thing worth buying here and are fairly priced. Inside is dark and grim with no ambiance and barely space to move. One of the lesser brunch options in dublin for sure overall. Does not deserve a place in the city centre."
125,Mish.Mash Art Caffe,4.6,"I adore this space. I have ibs myself and was actively struggling finding a space to eat after a rough plane ride, the owner helped me really well in finding something that would fit my dietary restrictions, fully saved me!! The space itself is gorgeous, artsy and cozy. I myself am not a coffee drinker, but i did see a ton of people come here just for the coffee! Vegetarian options: There are vegan & vegeterian options easily available! Dietary restrictions: There is a literal glutenfree soup Absolutely the cutest cafe Ive visited in Dublin. The coffee was excellent and the interior deco was very cosy. Jazz music playing on the backround was the cherry on the top. You would not believe you were just on a busy street when you sit down for your order. The service was excellent. Id give 6 stars if I could. I love this place so much. Coffee is delicious and served with a glass of water. Small, cosy spot with kind staff and good music playing not too loudly :) Fantastic atmosphere: music is good but not too loud; only a few tables. But this enables attentive, quick service! Food is tasty and priced very well (e.g. toastie of the day for less than  10). Coffee is good quality, and excellent bean supplier (Upside, one of the best local providers). Overall, great spot for a light brunch or catch up with friends over coffee. The vibe , atmosphere, furniture, decorations all perfect it s so cozy also the staff are friendly and welcoming! The place clean and smells good! The instrumental background music is nice! It s a small place yet you don t feel uncomfortable there is enough space to set down alone or with your people and enjoy your drinks/food. I ordered the Orange espresso and I recommend it! I didn t imagine it will taste this good! Overall I highly recommend the place, wonderful experience! I believe this amazing place deserves even more than 5 stars - such a nice cafe to visit if you live or on a visit in Dublin - the location, the furniture, the music the service, the food and the vibe all is perfect and nice. We had coffee, goat sandwiches and the amazing courgette cake (super delicious). Highly recommended It s easy to walk past mish mash as it s at the far end of Capel street amidst 3 other cafes. Their coffee is one of the best I ve had. The cafe interiors are cosy, which sometimes double as a temporary art exhibit, and they always play tasteful music! Their sandwiches are a nut overpriced at 9 euro+ but they were very comforting and used top notch ingredients. They have a good selection of sweet treats as well. Friendly service! Lovely little place. Really good coffee. Friendly staff. Nice jazzy music. Perfect for a mid afternoon coffee Great coffee and they give a little treat in the side. Highly recommend the carrot cake! Probably my favorite cafe in Dublin for multiple reasons: 1) excellent espresso that automatically comes with glass of water, 2) delicious home made snacks and cakes, half of them are vegan, staff knows the ingredients, 3) wines by glass - small selection but all of them are good quality and its not just the usual boring styles that are served everywhere, 4) staff is always friendly and attentive, 5) cozy interior that makes me feel like Im visiting a friend rather than a cafe, 6) nice loose leaf tea selection although I have yet to try any of them. The only thing I wish was different are the opening hours. I usually crave coffee in the morning before I start working so I have to go to other places for my morning coffee. Brilliante.. I live in Rome. This is most peaceful genuine cafe to chill n enjoy fine coffee and food in city centre.. consigliato 5* Such a beautiful cafe with delicious food and a friendly inviting warm atmosphere created by the owner Carolina. Highly recommend stopping by. I look forward to my next time! This place is a gem and I love returning every time. Fresh and tasty meals, great service and a very cosy and authentic ambiance. I love it Food : 5/5 Soup and toastie were super delicious. I got the basil, tomato, mozzarella toastie and loved it so much. The croutons in the soup were so good! The green smoothie was meh but it was the barista s first day so I understand! I m visiting from Canada and the food hit the spot after a long flight in. There are cookies baking right now and they smell divine. This place also uses biodegradable takeaway cups so another reason to love. Also, one of the oldest buildings. V charming. Lovely place, cozy and quiet. Nice staff also! Delicious cake and tea, prices a bit over but completely worth it. One of my favourite small cafes in Dublin. The food and coffee here are both lovely. The place has a very  homemade  cozy vibe. The soup & sambo deal is probably the best item to go for, but if you come in the afternoon you can also have wine or a spritz. Definitely a hidden gem on Capel Street! Very cosy place! Only had tea but they have huge variety - portions are small but still really nice! Such a cozy and nice place to have a cup of coffee. Nice coffee and cozy atmosphere always My favorite cafe in Dublin! Great coffee, great vibe, pretty good food Food I was looking for a vegan treat before work and came across this place so i thought id give it a try. very dark and poky inside, so not welcoming bt i was ordering to take away so this wasnt an issue. chose a slice of Banana bread and an americano with oat milk. i asked for lots of room for milk, and was given very little. i asked for my coffee to be transferred into the next biggest cup to facilitate this and asked her to fill the rest of the cup with oat milk. she then said she had to charge me for  extra  oat milk, bringing my total to nearly 10 euro. i reminded her that none of there policies or prices are visivle to the customer and she replied that if i wasbt happy paying 10 euro for a small coffee and aome banana bread i could leave. needless to say i wont be returning.. would not recommend coming here. coffee was disgusting and sickening and food was nice but way too overpriced. waitress was not friendly and unhelpful when i asked a simple question. did not enjoy my experience here and would suggest going for coffee elsewhere. Update: Its SIX years since I was in here. I was in the area today and thought there was no way it would still be here, through the pandemic etc., but to my utter pleasure, there it was, cool as ever. Made my day! Coffee is still fab, anywhere that the host weighs out the coffee meticulously is a winner in my book. Hard to get decent coffee sometimes, but not here! BLT was delicious, served with little pot of red pesto and some salad. Banana bread was equally fab. Great to see the same owner in place also, really lovely to catch up with her after so long. Lots of chat to catch up on after six years! The world has gone through so much in that time, as have we in our lives. Great to see things that have survived and remained great! Still a haven! #SaveTheWafer Original Review: This place is a gem. Totally relaxed vibe, lovely coffee, super looking food (look forward to trying some!). Owner is very friendly too. Nice paintings rotating from time to time. Fabulous bathroom! Makes working in town worthwhile when you can step away from it all into a haven like this. And, they automatically serve water when you order coffee. All the bonus points for that! Very cute little cafe with vegan food. Coffee was decent but unexceptional. Atmosphere and music is first rate Small place, but dont be afraid to venture in a little further as there are more tables toward the back. Coffee wasnt strong and was just right for me. The BLT comes with a small portion of sun dried tomato paste, just smear a little on each bite and youll be in heaven. Highly recommended. Lovely little place delicious coffee and beautiful atmosphere Loved this gorgeous place Miss Mash 65 Capel St, everything about it was amazing the welcome, the ambiance, the quality of the food & service Nice coffee shop on Capel Street. They serve good coffee and cakes. Their prices are a bit on the expensive side but from what I could see they use fresh ingredients and have vegan options. Im happy to spend a bit more and help independent businesses like this one. Love this place Always good vibes Friendly and chilled Top notch coffee Beautiful cozy place with attention to details. Super cute. And delicious coffee Such a cute cozy cafe! They have a nice variety of teas and friendly staff. Ive been here a handful of times. Its a great, low-key place to meet up with someone as its quiet and warm. It is a tiny place so there are only a few tables but Ive never had a problem finding a seat. Love the decor and ambience. Coffee was great and nice service. Made our family feel very welcome and made lovely little babyccinos for the kids Cute cafe however music played very unsuitable for calm coffeeshop (loud house/techno). When I asked if lights could be turned on to read my book response was a bit rude and it wasn t allowed. A relaxing haven in the middle of Dublin city centre. Nice homely atmosphere created by music and decoration. Fantastic staff. Enjoyed my americano very much -  not the best coffee Ive had but still very good. Will definitely visit again! Really delicious sweet and savoury treats. Very chill and friendly staff and the cafe is super cute too! Will for sure be back time and time again Ive been twice now and both times its been lovely! Its so chilled here and cute and the food is absolutely delicious! This has definitely become my new favourite cafe in Dublin! The girl who runs it is extremely friendly and chatty! This is my favorite coffee place in Dublin! The coffee is great and they have homebaked goods every day along with tasty sandwiches and daily soup. The presentation of the food is also always beautiful for the eye. The owner and her staff are so friendly and the cozy atmosphere makes you want to chill there the whole day with your book or a friend:) This is one of my cool places to visit, in Dublin. Always clean and  bright, and smiling staff. Good coffee, soups, and homemade cakes. The last time i was there i met Caroliina, the charming and friendly owner, and we had a nice chat while i had coffee and cake. Recommended, a little oasis of calm on a busy street. Nice and small little cafe. The barista cares about clients. Came in for a takeaway coffee, and couldnt take my eyes from the design. Small and cosy space. Plenty of nice food and delicious looking cakes."
126,Molly Malone Statue,4.625,"The Molly Malone Statue in Dublin, while not surrounded by any particularly notable attractions, offers a glimpse into the heart of Irish folklore. This plain bronze statue commemorates Molly Malone, a figure from a mysterious and enduring Dublin legend. According to the tale, Molly was a beautiful young fishmonger who tragically died of a fever, and her ghost is said to have haunted the streets of Dublin ever since. Though the statue itself may be simple, it stands as a testament to a story that has deeply woven itself into Irish culture, making it a poignant stop for those interested in the rich tapestry of Irelands mythic past. A beautiful status designed by Jeanne Rayhart. The status is about a song tells the fictional tale of a fishwife who plied her trade on the streets of Dublin and died young, of a fever. In the late 20th century, a legend grew up that there was a historical Molly, who lived in the 17th century. Good spot to visit, take a photo and get your lucky touch on her   Only u should know her story, check the internet as nothing is written there at the statue. If you are around it's ok to go and see Molly, but you must know that this is a kitsch tourist magnet and a  bosomy version of Molly    as The Irish Times called it in a sniffy piece in 1989 when she was fresh from the foundry. Touching her exposed breasts, is practice said to bring good luck, but I believe more in the power of a well poured Guinness... Worth a quick visit to watch all the tourists queueing to have their photos taken by the nice lady and the men cheekily rubbing her expansive bosom. I waited quite some time to take a photo without all the crowds of people. Shes quite easy to find and the way there is well signposted. Molly Malone had quite a reputation.   So much so that there are songs about her and a bronze statue.  You can see by the photo that her breasts are discolored from all the hands that have grabbed them over the years. Very sweet and historic (well, erected in 1988 during the Dublin Millennium celebrations) statue of Molly Malone, designed by sculptor Jeanne Rynhart, based on a song telling the fictional story of a fish wife plying her trades in the streets near here in lovely Dublin. Neither traditional nor historic is the fairly recent custom of tourist, who, according to The Irish Times sometime before 2014, tourists began rubbing the statues bosom area for luck, with some visitors getting a photo of themselves doing so. The relatively new practice has been criticsed by some, including Dublin-born singer Imelda May, who associated it with the objectification of women and questioned how the only statue in Dublin with breasts is basically assaulted in front of our childrens eyes daily. (from: Wikipedia) A well-known statue from Ireland whose music I know very well Nice little place to hang out and with Midnight the cat to keep you company. One of the famous spot in Dublin. A historic statue, telling the roots of Ireland. Everyone wants to have click with this lady  . Easy to locate. Around this place you will find many pubs, bars and eating places. Trip to Dublin is incomplete without having pic with this statue. The classical statue of a historic/mythical celebrity where you touch somewhere. Once done, an enchantment is cast upon you, compelling to return to the place. Locals call her The Tart with the Cart among other things. A really fun landmark in the heart of Dublin. Plaques tell the history and give info on the sculptor. Traditionally you touch her cleavage. This is apparent by how brightly polished the bronze is in this area as compared to the rest of the statue! Molly Malone is a star!! People loves her a lot Beautiful, must visit, Im not touching her chest though. Lol. I love the legend behind the Ms. What do yall think? Was she or wasnt she? Either way Ill be back to Beautiful Dublin City!! Visited on The Molly Malone bronze monument is quite the spectacle. Its fascinating how male visitors cant resist resting their heads on her breasts, resulting in a polished golden glow that reflects the sunlight. Its a peculiar sight to see grown men queuing up for this unique experience. Who knew a bronze statue could become such a shrine for breast enthusiasts? Its an interesting phenomenon worth witnessing if youre ever in Dublin. Molly Malone is a definite must see if youre looking for some good luck   in Dublin. Just rub her breasts which are shining from all the luckseekers attention. We didnt see her at first, as she was blocked from view from all the people around taking pictures and rubbing away Molly Malone represents Dublin. Cool location near lots of stores and restaurants. I love this statue. Interesting tribute to a supposed ficticious character in the song, but you must do your own research to get the story.  Convenient meeting point. A connection to my childhood had drawn me to this statue. Lovely area of Dublin, nice and quiet. I think there should be a sign somewhere though requesting that nobody sits on any part of the statue as it makes it difficult to take pics. Worth a visit to see the statue and get a photo but expect a wait or to have other people in your photo as there are always people around. There is normally a busker nearby too which adds to the experience. Famous statue in Dublin. You can definitely see where she gets rubbed the most! Very cool statue right in front of the church. Located in a great part of the city with lots of pubs, restaurants, and shops all around. Quiet area in what feels like a big alley way. Usually not busy and someone is always playing music nearby. Great piece of history to go see if you are visiting Dublin. It is a quick visit and doesn t require much time to see. There are no fences or gates so it s free to take pictures with. The kids became fascinated with Molly Malone after learning the old Dublin song so I brought them in to see the statue. They were mesmerised. My daughter scanned the QR code to listen to the story and she sat down beside Molly and sang the song to cheer her up Interesting tribute to a supposed ficticious character in the song, but you must do your own research to get the story.  Convenient meeting point. Beautiful statue. Dress looked very authentic of the era. It was cool where the statue was located, right where we took our full day bus tour. Ireland is beautiful, and rich with history. The perfect place for photography. Beautiful old church and surroundings. many tourists and children. a really nice place to take photos and have memories. every recommendation to come and visit. She is graceful even as a statue. Good location, and if you go early enough, there are not as many people so photos are possible! Molly always looks fabulous. Even when some vandals used a bit of paint to grant her some additional modesty. With a bit of a polished she will look even better and once again alive alive oh. Great for a good rub she is known for to bring good luck Nice statue, but hard to get a good photo with all of the tourists crowding around it. Recommend trying to go early morning to view it. Its a statue of Molly Malone which for some reason people believe touching her bosom brings luck. So thats what everyone does when they see it; as you can see in the picture and the video. Molly Malone is the enigmatic heroine of the famous song of the same name, widely recognised as Dublin s unofficial anthem. Immortalized in bronze during the 1988 Dublin Millennium celebrations, when 13 June was declared to be Molly Malone Day. The Molly Malone statue stands in the heart of the city s historic Georgian Quarter. Though regularly upheld as a traditional Irish ballad, it s not known where the song originated or if Molly Malone ever existed. Beautiful statue infront of the church, located just off the Main Street. I have paid my respects and it is in your interest to do so too if you come across this magnificent statue! Great historic statue with a fantastic QR code to scan with a narration done to explain the significance of the area and Molly Malone Might have been a bit better if two old guys hadnt been using the plinth as a bed in the middle of the afternoon. Still the fictional character was still charming despite the reclining gentlemen. A branze statue of the mythical Dublin fishmonger Mollly Malone. Made famous by a song of the same name. Often sung on sporting occasions both local and International and at the occasional sing song. It is a bronze statue of a fictional fishmonger named Molly Malone. She is the star of a well-known Irish song and represents working class in Dublin. She sells stuff from her cart. Tourists favourite activity is to take pictures of themselves while holding Molly Mallone statue top body part used for feeding kids (original word marked by Google as offensive one ;-) ) and thats why this part of the statue is a bit polished. Its located next to ONeills pub, church and post office. The Tart with the cart can be found in the heart of the city. Made of bronze she has aged well since being erected but she definitely needs a shawl over her to cover them breasts that keep being played with by adolescent boys ( & girls ) still shes not one for complaining! Very interesting statue in the heart of the city  there s an interesting story behind Molly Malone. They say you have to touch her breasts for good luck    I think it s worth to check it and just take a quick snapshot like I did! It s kind of a famous node in the area and popular meeting place. There is always some street singer around the area and it s a very lively place indeed. Temple bar area is very close if you want to grab a drink. You can sit here the whole day and won t feel bored at all. For all the tourism buses for a day long tour, this is the place to meet up in the morning. The statue itself is glorious and the backdrop of it is also beautiful."
127,Murphy's Bistro Cafe,4.675,"Googled Murphys Bistro Cafe for the best breakfast in Dublin, before we left home. So we headed here first thing in the morning, well about 8.15am, as we had an early flight into Dublin. The Dublin express coach dropped us by the O Connell Bridge and Murphys was across the bridge and 50 yards up the other side. Love the interior styling inside here. Great that you could see through the serving hatch and into the kitchen, and the chefs busy at work preparing the food We chose the full Irish breakfast, ah you have to Lovely tasty breakfast, side dish of toast and butter and a tasty cup of tea. The food came to our table very quickly, from ordering, they are very efficient, as it was busy. Staff were very polite and friendly, a great service I would recommend reserving a table to be honest, as this place would become very busy! When we came out, a Hen party was coming in, about 20 ladies! So it is a very popular place to come to and I would recommend coming to Murphys. I m from the states and I was looking more for a more authentic Irish breakfast, the breakfast at the hotel wasn t cutting it anymore. The full Irish breakfast was delicious I went there twice during my stay, they have a quick turn around so it seems like they can always get you in a seat. The service was great and fast, I know I know us Americans want everything fast lol. My trip here was packed full of things to do so it was nice to get a close to authentic breakfast in a tourist heavy city and get it quick so I don t miss out in the sights. If I come back to Dublin I ll be sure to stop here again! Really loved this place. I got fish and chips and my partner got the burger. We both really enjoyed our meals - the fish and chips were gorgeous. Fish was really fresh and flaky. Great vibe inside and the service was really good too. Reasonable prices. Would defiantly recommend and we will be back. **German Style Breakfast** This is the only place we found that serves a truly European-style, almost German breakfast. The seating is comfortable and plentiful, making it easy to find a spot to relax. The service is fast, efficient, and welcoming, adding to the overall pleasant dining experience. The breakfast offerings include a variety of freshly baked bread, a selection of cold cuts, cheeses, and traditional spreads, perfectly capturing the essence of a hearty German breakfast. Paired with strong coffee and fresh juices, this meal is a delightful start to the day. If youre craving a taste of Europe in the morning, this spot is a must-visit. This place was outstanding. The food was out of this world, service was better than most and the interior was beautiful. I had the Irish breakfast and could not finish it. The bacon was exactly like I have it all the time at home, cooked softly not crispy. The hash brown was like no other. It came with mushrooms but did not eat them. My mother ate them at said they were great. The blood pudding was earthy and not bad. The sausage was very good and the eggs were cooked perfectly. My wife had the pouched eggs. They were perfectly cooked for pouched eggs. But the part that was great on her plate were the potatoes and the cheese that came with the dish. I would recommend this place for breakfast for sure. We will probably be back on this trip for breakfast. I stopped into Murphys on a whim because it was one of the places open early enough for breakfast.  I ordered a mocha and the avocado toast and...WOW.  This was the best breakfast I had in Dublin.  The poached egg, pomegranate seeds, and feta cheese went perfectly with the fresh avocado.  The potatoes seemed simple but were seasoned perfectly.  This was a must stop breakfast location. Guinness stew was SO good, rich thick gravy and chunky mash which I prefer. The Apple juice is also really nice, def fresh, it has that mild bitterness. Unassuming place, very  nothing special  but in the best way. Not touristy or throwing shamrocks in your face, just a simple place with nice food and a cozy atmosphere. Staff is really nice. Fun gastropub vibe. We had breakfast here which was DELICIOUS! Great coffee! The music was a bit loud on entry for breakfast, but I think it was turned down a bit after we arrived. Would definitely dine again! Although the ambience is very nice the food Full Irish was not good. The toast is cheap white bread and should be replaced with crusty fresh bread from a bakery. The bacon was so salty it was barely edible. The beans just regular canned . The potato just a frozen hash brown. Use homemade. The sausage was horrible. Try changing brands. The black putting tasted old .A restaurant that s home cooked style should put their heart and soul into the dishes. But very doors decorating styles of lights and walls and table and floor. If youre looking for brunch in Dublin then you cant go wrong here. Great food and friendly service, quick and easy and a reasonable piece all near the heart of the city! Presentation maybe isnt 5 star but flavour wins! The food was okay, but nothing great. I appreciated that gluten free options were available. The service was slow and inefficient - it took a long time for someone to take our order and they kept forgetting to bring us what we ordered. It took one hour to get the food, despite the fact the restaurant wasnt very busy. Also, the food came in waves, so we didnt get to eat together. We had the Irish and Turkish breakfast platter. It did not disappoint. Be warned, you will leave full. A platter could be shared with two people. Recommended from a friend and this place doesn t disappoint. Had a breakfast on the first day which was very good along with a hot chocolate and an amazing chocolate fudge cake on the second day. Staff are very friendly. Fantastic Irish breakfast and very well served and tasty. The atmosphere is super nice, the service is fast and great! Made space for a big group on Friday morning, good breakfast, beautiful plate and fair price for Dublin. Good coffee. Can recommend. I had a full Irish breakfast and cappuccino. Absolutely unbelievably good. The food was plated stunningly and tasted just as good. The portion was generous. The servers were always smiling. Overall, a fantastic place for breakfast. There Eggs Benedict breakfast was absolutely amazing for a first time visitor from Canada or being a local. Olives and salad too? Yes!!! Be sure to order a side of potatoes/hash browns with extra hollandaise for an even tastier time. The full Irish was fine, nothing special in terms of quality or quantity a fairly standard cooked breakfast.  There was a sizeable queue to wait for a table so clearly a popular place. Service was good Found this delightful Jewel in the crown along the river- lovely location and vibrant atmosphere. Super efficient & friendly staff- incredible service - we ordered 2 breakfast dishes each and massively underestimated the size! Eggs Benedict with Salmon along with Nutella/Fruit Pancakes- both were absolutely delicious - the seeded brioche, olives and salmon were a great  combination with the perfectly cooked runny yoked eggs. Then onto the pancakes which were also equally delicious- don t think we ll need to eat for the rest of the week! Ha! Team Murphy s Bistro take a bow! A great morning brunch location. There is no better way to start into a day than with a brunch at Murphy s. I took the vegetarian breakfast and the amount was just the right size and super delicious. The most delightful avocado toast. Feta was a nice edition and the potato chips made it extra filling. Wont be needing lunch after this plate If you love breakfast... Be here!  Solid portions, good quality, lovely servers! Full stars,  the food was amazing and full of flavour. We tried out the breakfast and will defiantly be returning to try the lunch and evening menus. The employees so friendly and helpful. Also very quick service. Kid-friendliness: Friendly staff Breakfast got nice white and black pudding, rest is cheapest products like in all greasy cafes, sausages never been near meet,   taste like backon... Not worth paying that money. Food Yummy and pretty cheap menu options) for Dublin at least)!! Quick and friendly service. Recommend the pancakes with fruit and nutella :) Service is very fast and overall friendly. The portions are way too big, to an unhealthy level. This makes everything too expensive, youre overpaying to contribute to food waste. Another side effect is that the clientele is morbidly obese, during our time at the restaurant we hardly could see anyone who wasnt obese. You need to pay at the register, where they push very high tip options on you (I think it starts from 12.5% and goes to 25%). Overall the food is good, but I would not normally come here. The only reason I came was because my wife wanted to try a full Irish breakfast. The eggs benedict with salmon was absolutely amazing. The latte looked nice. The waitress was very acomadating and the atmosphere was very fitting for the christmass time It was a great breakfast experience. Their menu has an optimal number of options which spared us decision fatigue and the meals are pretty easy to read through without hyperbole. We did not book ahead, but we managed to secure a table at the rear. There is also a vegan full breakfast option! Staff were speedy and accomodating. Price to value ratio was excellent. We can recommend this breakfast place to anyone wholeheartedly. What a wee Gem! Great location, the staff are so friendly and quick service. The food was amazing. I had eggs and toast, and my partner had the menemen. 10/10 would recommend. I think its the best poached eggs Ive ever had. We ended up going back the following day. Great value for money and the food was fresh and delicious. Shout out to the staff and chefs, great experience. P s. Coffee was delicious ! Dietary restrictions: They had oat milk and almond milk Exceptional food. The Turkish breakfast had well seasoned olives and chorizo with exceptional cheese selection, highly recommend. The hash browns were delicious and included in most plates that we got. Love that the Benedict s were served on ciabatta and not English muffins  . Highly recommend! Wow, what an establishment. Food, service & atmosphere is excellent.  A must visit, you wont be disappointed. Food This was our first stop in Dublin at lunch time, and oh boy, what a lunch. We were a couple in a thursday at 14:00. We ordered the omelet and the ultimate sandwich with gluten-free bread. They have a couple of gluten-free options, very important for those with allergies. The amount of food in each plate was more than enough to feed a mortal being ( two sandwiches, and the omelet, bent in the middle, could fill the plate). All in all this a very nice place to have a lunch and its not very expensive. I recommend it. 9/10 place. Dietary restrictions: Gluten-free options Brilliant. Went there early since I read some reviews stating that the restaurant is quite small and often crowded. By doing so (=around 5pm) we were fortunate enough to have a good table and the full attention from both the waitresses and what I believe was the restaurant manager. All smiles, happy to understand Norwenglish and quick to help when needed. The food = Beef & Guiness stew for me. Best version so far. (Think I need to find a good recipe for this when I get back to Norway...) The stew had been boiling away for many hours and was just so tender and niiiiice! Wifes food was Sirloin steak. Lots of mushrooms and onion. She rated her dish 4.5*/5. Mine was a 5*, easy. Ps, the last photo. Best compliment you give a chef. An empty, almost licked plate. We had a very nice lunch here. We arrived just as breakfast was ending so the place wasnt very busy. Staff was very helpful and efficient. The food was delicious. Great place to check out. Plenty of food options on the menu. The menu items we had were delicious! We came back a 2nd night to try more.  The staff members are friendly and helpful with the menu if you have questions. Food was perfect, my father and I ordered a Turkish breakfast, we enjoyed it very much. The service was on point, polite, food was made quickly. And the atmosphere is stunning from the inside, very decorative in their own way. It is a really Good place for breakfast,  my family totally enjoy every bite of the food. Friendly staff high recommend. I probably will try there dinner menu tonight! Murphys is a great little bistro on a central location in Dublin. They serve breakfast, lunch as well as drinks later in the day. We went there for breakfast, which was fabulous. Great ambiance, fantastic food and coffee. Family friendly as well. Kid-friendliness: Kid friendly place for breakfast. Really cute restaurant, great place to stop for a nice breakfast before going to the airport. It wasnt too crowded so they took my order immediately and had the food out very quickly. The food was pretty good too. Overall, great experience. Definitely recommend! A fantastic place to eat i the heart of Dublin. The staff is very kind and helpful. The food is delicious and beautiful. Just look at their take on avocado toast. Yum"
128,Musical Pub Crawl,4.7,"Steven and Niles were amazing! They are both incredibly talented professional musicians who also have a wonderful wit about them! We learned so much about Irish music and we were exposed to every possible instrument you could think of. One of the highlights of our trip for sure!! I attended musical pub crawl about 8 years ago with my wife, and upon returning to Dublin I invited my co-workers to join me. While skeptical at first, they were immediately brought in to the musical culture of Ireland through hilarious, lyrical, and emotional stories of the two musicians who led us on a musical tour. While this may seem touristy, I think this is the best way to experience Irish music - through storytelling, a pint or two, and of course amazing songs and melodies. I highly recommend this. The Musical Pub Crawl Dinner was AMAZING. We went on our first evening in Ireland while on a week-long family vacation. It was such a nice introduction to Irish music/culture. The hosts were so talented and also hilarious  it felt like part comedy show! The space was intimate and the food was yummy. The dancer, Owen, was SO talented and incredibly friendly. We had our 4 year old along with us and they were all so welcoming & kind to her as well. I would 100% recommend this to anyone traveling to/through Dublin! I attended the same show in September 2022, and the music was outstanding, upbeat, lively. The two performers played multiple instruments and were great storytellers. We had a a fabulous evening and couldnt wait to return. As soon as I knew I was returning to Dublin, I booked a Music crawl expecting another great evening. Well this performance was very disappointing and personally would not attend another crawl, I will look to another option when I return. Fantastic evening entertainment of the highest class. I work with group travel from Sweden and we always start on the day of arrival with the Musical Pub Crawl for our groups. A fantastic start to the trip to Dublin to learn about Irish music and pub history from very talented musicians. Very entertaining evening which usually ends with most of my happy travelers following the musicians to some session in Dublin Travel to Dublin without doing a classic Musical Pub Crawl... then youve really missed something. Really fun experience giving background on the basics of Irish music. The two musicians were very talented and our group, including a 14 and 10 year old, had a great time. The performance was informative, funny, and engaging to watch and participate in! We thoroughly enjoyed learning about the musical traditions (instrument/songs) in Ireland and were amazed at the dancing. Great night in Dublin! I read about this tour in a travel guide I purchased and it was hands down the best thing we did in Dublin. We enjoyed listening to the two men play and share about Irish music. The are incredibly talented musicians and did a great job of involving the audience. I highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Dublin. Excellent way for a visitor to discover real Irish music and dance for the first time, plenty of explaining and even a bit of participation. Really lovely friendly presentation by the musicians and dancer. Music was utterly joyful. Plus recommendations of where to find the real thing if planning to try to find more authentic music later in the evening. We did the one with the meal, great value. First pub is great, the real thing. The second place they acknowledged isnt really an Irish pub and the food was generic (school dinner like) but catered to all tastes I suppose (lots of Americans in the audience), and this is a tourist event after all. Highly recommended overall. We started upstairs at a pub called Ha Penny Bridge Inn. We enjoyed some Irish tunes and songs. After spending a while there we all walked to the next pub called Flannigans where we were offered several options for dinner. The food was good and plentiful. We ordered our drinks from the bar. We enjoyed more music and Irish dancing. Overall it was a very fun and entertaining evening. After Flannigans some people from our group walked to other pubs recommended by the musicians but the official tour ended after Flannigans. This was a good intro to traditional Irish music and the musicians were great. The two pubs we went to for drinks and dinner are nice venues and the dinner accommodated our dietary needs. Note that this is aimed at tourists. We werent able to continue into the nighttime sessions. Loved this pub crawl and actually told some folks that are going to Dublin so they will book. The first half of the musical experience was wonderful, and we really enjoyed the music, the singing, and learning about how the music fits into traditional Irish culture. Unfortunately, the second half of the experience moved to a second pub that was very far away from the first pub, a half mile or so, and was so far away that we had to turn back. I don t understand why they couldn t find a closer pub to walk to for the second half and avoid all the unnecessary walking. A wonderful evening with the talented and fun musical artists. Just the right number of people in the room and just the right length of time. Great music and fun history lessons! Fabulous time.  Not only was this a masterclass in Irish music, our two musicians were funny and entertaining.  Got the entire group to sing as well.  A highlight event of our time in Ireland. The information about Irish musical tradition provided great perspective into what we were hearing.  History of instruments was a bonus!  The musicians were real pros, Steven and Brenda were terific! We couldn t have enjoyed this performance any more. The setting was intimate and all three performers interacted meaningfully with the audience who really fed off of the passion and personality of the performers. The musicians and dancer were clearly quite skilled and dedicated to their crafts. The performance was a perfect send-off from a wonderful week in Ireland. Slan go foill! Very talented musicians sharing alot of good music and information about instruments and songs. The Irish dancer was just charming! A most excellent meal at Flanagans! Such a fun night. Lots of fun and our musicians (sorry dont remember their names) shared not only their musical talents but also stories behind the instruments and songs. Informative, funny and relaxing. The 1st part of the evening is at the HaPenny Bridge Inn pub where the beer was cold and the space big enough to accommodate us all (maybe 40 people in total?). The 2nd part, where dinner was served, was in the basement of Flanagans, a place across the Liffey - quarters were a little tight but the food was good and overly plentiful, and there was an Irish  dancer (who had been the coordinator at the 1st place). It was a fun way to cap off our 1st night in Ireland before we crashed and burned from a long flight followed by 6 hours of seeing as much of Dublin as we could. Recommend. FYI, cost of beer is not included in purchase price. Loved the music and it was well worth the cost of the night.Not only heard great Irish music but learned about different musical instruments. Would do it again if I was in Ireland. We recently went to Dublin for 5 days. We went to this event on the last night of our stay. It was great. The only regret was that we didnt do earlier in the trip. The event was a wonderful preview into Irish culture. The musicians were charming. They were great storytellers, charismatic,  and fantastic musicians. The Irish dancer that joined them was extremely talented, beautiful,  and equally charismatic. The dinner part of the show was very tasty, and along with the music, a couple of pints, and some local tips for live music nearby, it was a great evening and learning experience. This was a really fun experience. The music was excellent and the information provided by the performers was great. We got to know a bit about the background of the music and the instruments. If you are expecting a few hours of just music you might be a bit disappointed, as there is a bit of talking and banter. But if you are looking to learn more about Irish music in addition to hearing some great music, then this is a great tour. This was recommended to us from a friend who had participated a couple of years prior. I expected a night of music, but what we received instead was an evening at home with friends. Seriously! Booster and Niall created such an intimate experience with not just music, but stories, Irish history, some laughs and invited guest interaction. We would absolutely go again next time we are in Dublin. (Wish Id been less engaged, and thought to bring out my phone to take a couple of pics. Oh well, next time!) This was a marvelous experience for 3 US chaps who wanted to experience some solid Irish Trad music. Held in 2 pubs with a little over an hour in each, the space was intimate and private. Neil and Booster were a superb duo, each bringing their own personality to the music. Neil was the serious one and Booster was the prankster which made for some fun repartee. They both told wonderful stories and related relevant info of some of the Irish musical styles. Each was an excellent musician and they made all of us participants feel at home and included. I would recommended this duo to everyone and will look forward to coming back to this experience again. Had a great time at the musical pub crawl. We went the second night of a 4 day stay and we are glad we went at the beginning of our visit rather than the end.    The musicians were talented and made the evening fun by entertaining us with music, stories, and a little bit of history and information about the traditional Irish music.  Gave us an Introduction to Irish music and recommended other pubs for Trad Sessions.   Happy we signed up for this. The Musical Pub Crawl was one of our favorite things we did in Dublin. Our hosts Booster and Nile perfectly blended humor, storytelling, knowledge, and of course their incredible musical skills. We enjoyed it so much. Would highly recommend! My family of four (including two teens) kicked off our trip to Dublin with the musical pub crawl and could not recommend it highly enough. It was such a great, authentic introduction to Irish music, culture, history and pub life. The musicians were so talented, full of great stories and funny. Well worth the time and money! Had a great time at the musical pub crawl with Bianca and Booster! They were talented, entertaining and fun.  We learned a bit about traditional sessions and the music of Ireland. Very glad we signed up for it. We ll certainly pass this activity on to friends who visit Dublin. Very fun way to experience Irish traditional music for the uninitiated.  Niall and Rooster were fantastic hosts. I brought my mom, who was skeptical of  trad  music, and it wound up being a vacation highlight for her.  Niall gave us lots of tips for good sessions for our trip around the island.  Highly recommend! The guys and music were awesome! Great price for what you get. My only disappointment was the second venue was a long walk and did not feel like a pub but more like an Italian restaurant in the basement. Would ve been better just to stay at Ha Penny pub even though that wouldn t have made the definition of a crawl. We arrived at the Ha Penny Inn really excited for our Musical Pub Crawl. We went upstairs and got a couple of nice ales and were soon joined by several others. Two musicians went to the front of the room, introduced themselves, and began chatting about traditional Irish music. They cracked some jokes along the way, especially about the Temple Bar as not being a place for real music. Well they played a song  and started bantering about pubs, music, and traditions. And they played another song. More talking and chatting and talking and talking snd they played another song and more talking. This was supposed to be a musical pub crawl,  but by 9:00pm we d heard maybe three songs and heard lots of talking. And the crawl? Well, turns out we were going to walk twenty minutes to the next venue, same musicians, just a different place, and that was it for the evening. We walked and walked and walked some more to arrive at a basement room set up like a seventh grade classroom, ready to hear more talking snd less playing. We were very disappointed!! Why leave the Ha Penny at all? Seems like a setup to sell some more beer than an evening with musicians. We left. Would not recommend. We had more fun at The Temple Bar. Did the crawl with my husband and two kids (16 and 20). We all loved it.  The kids especially loved it! The two musicians were talented, charming, very knowledgeable, and super funny. We did this at the beginning of our Ireland trip and it s been great to have the knowledge they passed on as we ve traveled. Highly recommend! I booked this spur of the moment because the first music tour I wanted was full, and Im so happy that I went ahead with this one! It was like a music tour, comedy show & history lesson all rolled into one. I learnt a lot, the musicians involved were lovely blokes, very charismatic & talented...and their passion for Irish music really shone through! The host was lovely & friendly too. What a fabulous event! We had SO much fun - the musicians were amazing: funny and informative and incredibly talented. The pubs were great, roomy enough, attentive bartenders, atmospheric. I learned a lot about the history of Irish music while having a great time!! Super fun tour of Irish music in 2 historical pubs. I highly recommend this tour! If you want a REAL taste of traditional Irish music and pub culture, this is the place to start. You can go to any number of bars in Ireland to hear  trad  (traditional music) but often it ll be tourist-oriented standards like  Whiskey in the Jar  and fiddle & guitar covers of John Denver songs, accompanied by loud, drunken 20-somethings. The Musical Pub Crawl is the real deal. Real traditional music, played without amplification, and made better by enough explanation and background for the newby and Celtic music fan alike. Brewster and Nile were fun, funny, extremely talented, and made great suggestions about where to go find more genuine trad sessions in Dublin. We had so, so much fun on this tour! Our hosts, Bianca and Booster, we such amazing musicians. You can really see their passion for their craft. They were also soooo funny and had great chemistry. We learned a lot about Irish music and sessions in general, they were so knowledgeable about the history and really did an excellent job of sharing it in interesting ways! Thank you!! The incredibly talented musical artists shared their deep passion for all things Irish through song, humor, history, storytelling and great Irish beer.  One of the best nights I have experienced in my international travel.  No trip to Dublin would be complete without this musical evening We booked the Pub Crawl to kick off our Ireland trip and it was just lovely. The music was fabulous and the information about traditional Irish music was gold. It was a great introduction and we are so grateful that we did it. We got to the venue early and got lovely seats and some food at the pub. The step dancer at the second pub was absolutely fabulous, and the musicians were so generous and thoughtful. Highly recommend this! Absolutely loved the musical pub experience.  This is my second time and it s moving as ever. Eamon is a wonderful person, his talent and desire to share his musical heritage is inspiring. Booster was fun, engaging, great talent, fantastic singer. Will always recommend."
129,National Botanic Gardens,4.975,"The Dublin Botanical Garden is an absolute gem! Our visit was fantastic, starting with the convenience of easy parking, which made the experience stress-free from the get-go. The garden itself is sprawling and meticulously maintained, offering a serene escape from the city s hustle and bustle. We were impressed by the variety of plants and beautifully curated sections, each with its own unique charm. The sheer size of the garden means theres plenty to explore, with numerous paths leading to delightful discoveries around every corner. It s a perfect spot for nature lovers and those looking to unwind in a peaceful setting. One of the highlights for us was the abundance of excellent picnic spots. Whether youre looking for a sunny patch of grass or a shaded nook, theres a perfect spot waiting for you. We were fortunate to visit on a day with perfect weather, which made our picnic all the more enjoyable. We loved the rose garden, which was in full bloom and absolutely breathtaking. The garden also has well-maintained facilities and friendly staff, adding to the overall pleasant experience. Whether youre a local or just visiting Dublin, the Botanical Garden is a must-see destination that offers a wonderful blend of beauty, tranquility, and convenience. Highly recommended! Always an incredible array regardless of the season. Numerous paths, water areas for Lily pads, rose garden, greenhouses, succulents... Beautifully laid out and kept pristine. A few more rubbish bins around the park would be nice. Cafe has wonderful, fresh choices, a great coffee and lovely staff every time. Parking can be a bit difficult, especially in great weather, but its to be expected with such a great space! Everyone wants in. It was lovely to feel the calm and peace of greenery and flowers when only a short distance from the bustling city centre. The garden is very well maintained and has lots of glass houses and pathways to explore. Entry is free! There is also a cafe and restrooms. I went now when the tulips and daffodils bloomed and its very beautiful, its worth going. Especially if you have children, they will enjoy the view and the squirrels a lot. There is no entrance or parking fee, the only thing is that if you want to enter the parking lot and if it is full, you have to wait for someone to leave and then enter. Spent all day there. It s totally free to enter, even the greenhouses, and they take excellent care of the grounds. Probably the best park in Dublin Had an amazing time at the National Botanic Gardens! The diverse plant collection is impressive, and the layout is well-designed for exploring. The glasshouses are stunning, especially the Victorian Palm House. Informative exhibits add educational value. Highly recommend for nature lovers! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to reconnect with nature, learn more about plant life, or simply unwind in a serene and picturesque setting. Kudos to the staff and volunteers for their hard work in maintaining this botanical treasure, and I look forward to returning again soon! Very nice with indoor and outdoor exhibits.  Was free entry the day we went.  Bank holiday may have been the reason.  Public transit getting there was a little confusing, getting back to Dublin city center more so for us first-timers. Beautiful gardens that are really well looked after by their clearly very attentive staff who were working hard on the herbacious beds which were alive with colour. The arboretum was peaceful and perfect to relax in and look at a mix of native and foreign trees. Im a foreigner and today I found another reason to love Ireland, even though be winter, to walk across of that place made me feel in complete peace. You can go there in winter, summer, whenever, just enjoy listening the nature there. It is magic. Such a beautiful place to visit. The glass houses and tropical house are amazing and the outside space right in the middle of Dublin is such a peaceful sanctuary - full of wildlife. There is a restaurant on site also. Cannot recommend the Botanic Gardens enough. Beautiful as always, love this place ! I think it would be even nicer if there s a map or direction guide, I know there s one in the front gate but we need more      it s just too big hahah. Anyway love it !!! Lovely place to walk around for an afternoon. I really enjoyed the alpine plant greenhouse! The staff were all very pleasant and happy to answer questions. Loved the variety of plants. My kids had a blast too. Wonderful for an afternoons worth of stroll and relaxation. Hoped there was more info to read. The names could use some blowing up. Love botanic gardens  Highly recommend to all, who loves nature and plants. Like small oasis in the middle of the city. Morning well spent. It is improving every year. The buildings, the walk paths and facilities. The only downfall is small car park. I always plan my visit for first thing in the morning not to stress about parking spot. An excellent way to spend the afternoon. If you re in the area and the weather is nice, definitely come here. Not only is it free but it s a huge place with many beautiful flowers Such a lovely lovely day! Especially on a sunny day in the spring. Its completely free and beautiful <3 Well maintained national park.. Not as extensive as the Kew Gardens but considering its free entry cant complain. Still plenty of green to see even in winter...Spring /summer would probably be better. The park can be seen in 1 to 2 hrs time. Cafe is fine. Beautiful place, enjoyed every moment! Admission free- guided tours available but need to reserve in advance. I booked a tour last minute and was very glad I did. Green house was amazing! Absolute must go and see. With its beautiful surroundings and amazing history, not to mention only a short hop from city centre. Its really beautiful for photoshoots, day picnics, family time, or just to read a book. Really liked the cat, that lives in the tropical gardens ;) very friendly and chatty :)) Really enjoyed our visit here! I couldn t believe how big this place was and so well maintained. Highly recommend a visit here. One of the best places we have seen in Dublin. What I liked most were the green houses that are wonderful both outside and inside. Such an unbelievable place! The botanical gardens are truly a gem you need to see when in Dublin. Its pretty big and you can find all kinds of plants here, and it feels kinda strange to have something like this in the middle of the city, with entrance free of charge. Its not very modern, but in this case, it kind of just gives it even more authenticity and vibe. The place was brilliant. There were many different plants in there, such as cacti, tropical plants like pitcher plants and coffee , and African and Australian plants as well. The greenhouses were quite big, and some of them had decorations in them like the hut that can be seen in some of my photos. Its really lovely to see all the plants that wouldnt normally grow here. The place looked clean and looked after as well, so it was up to standard. A place you should go to if you take an interest in plants or gardens. Beautiful, could spend many hours going around the entire park or even just bringing food and having a picnic all day Went with my family over my summer holidays. It was a beautiful and sunny day. The park is lovely with tons of beautiful flowers and so many adorable squirrels Would 100% Recommend Absolutely beautiful place lovely flowers, and amazing architecture, it s free and there is a great cafe. Make make sure you get some of the cake while you re there. I love gardens, I love flowers. In this place there are flowers, food, trees, plants and so much more to admire. Go with time, is so pretty What a magnificent treasure this place is.  I wanted to find something beautiful for my family and I and stumbled upon this site and Wow!!  Go and spend time Calm and charming place. Definetely the natures energy is there. I left recharged for starting the week. This is one of my favorite places in Dublin. A beautiful place to escape, go for a walk or simply admire the flowers and plants all around us! Visited on the garden is very beautiful. Colourful flowers and a variety of plants. A good coffee place with a nice view. Even on a late Autumn day, the gardens hold treasures to discover and colors to behold. Be sure to discover the lightly distributed sculptures, especially the one dedicated to RNA and DNA, near the fern wall. In autumn, the salvias provide a burst of color to help cure the blues. Best of all... its free! And the 30 minute bus ride from the city center gives tourists a better view of the city of Dublin. Visited the Botanic Gardens in Dublin for the first time and it was great. A lot to see and the plants are very well kept! Nice place to have some fresh air, away from city hustle & bustle... lovely atmosphere! Great place for walks and reflections. Beautiful on every season. Brilliant for photos. Lots of birds and squirrels. Very good coffee shop and temporary exhibitions. Free entry Fantastic place to vist with family so clean and well maintained great work do here Very nice cafe here too nice coffee tea and food , car parking was free Visited on Perfect place for the plant lovers, Suitable area to explore the variety of plants. Toilet facility is available near the entrance,no tickets, Can find diversity of plants like cactus,gymnosperms, Angiosperms,grass variety and ireland native plants. Very nice place ..free of charge only car park need to pay. Amazing garden! Definitely a must to walk around. Beautiful"
130,National Leprechaun Museum of Ireland,4.6,"If you enjoy listening to stories full of lore, and a bit of history then youll love the Leprechaun museum. Its not truly a museum, but it doesnt matter because it engages your imagination in such a way that it does what a museum is supposed to do: educate you on the past so you can understand the present while shaping the future. Our storyteller was awesome! Funny, with a beautiful irish accent and change of tones that made the stories so much more interesting. Come in with an open mind and enjoy the experience. Also, strike up a conversation with Selma, shes at the register and she is so awesome and funny. Shell definitely make your experience a memorable one. Enjoy! I dont rate things often (actually never) but I had to come on and give this place some hype!! This was one of my FAVORITE things I did in Dublin! It was an AMAZING experience! Our tour guide/storyteller was so engaging and was able to engage both the adults and the children in the room! I absolutely loved the stories he told, about the history of Irish folklore and telling us some of his favorite Irish folklore! It was seriously a glorious experience and something Ill always remember and appreciate!! The day tour is very kid AND adult friendly!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! What a delightfully unexpected experience this was during our trip to Dublin! Our seven year old was determined to find/learn about leprechauns during our recent visit and this museum was an exceptional experience. The story telling was riveting, for her and us adults. The design of the museum was incredibly high end and technologically advanced. It was such a fun experience and we are so grateful we went. We highly recommend this to anyone, with or without kids! This was a truly unique experience and it was wonderful! I didnt book in advance, but the staff were very helpful in setting up a booking. The actual museum experience is an exploration into Irish folklore approximately 45 minutes and its absolutely fascinating! Learning and experiencing folklore from the guide in different ways and hearing the stories was so much fun and I cant recommend this enough! You need to check this out! Perhaps the best museum I have ever visited. The stories, the passionate performance, the expertise displayed by our guide moved me to laughter and tears. Worth every penny. Don t miss this experience when you come to Dublin! This was a cool experience in Ireland. The tour guide was really into it and was able to tell us the stories of the leprechaun. It almost makes you feel like a little kid hearing stories. Definitely schedule your time slot in advance. They only take a certain amount of people per hour I went to experience the darkland tour. Its not a great place if you are going for photos but it was an hour long stories of Ireland. The darkland is what it says, dark, gory and not for children but the storytellers are passionate and engaging and I was hanging off every word. If you like hearing engaging stories this is the tour for you! My father and I visited together and had an absolutely fantastic time.  The focus is really on folklore-- it doesnt have a bunch of artifacts or things to look at.  But what they have put together is really purposeful and guides the storytelling.  Our guide/storyteller, Sarah, was fantastic to listen to.  It made us want to learn more about the legends and mythology of Ireland.  It also made us excited about touring the countryside.  Sarah did a great job, not only telling the stories, but helping us understand how and why the lore changed and became what we presently understand about leprechauns and faeries.  It was so fun, informative, and whimsical. To start off, i feel like most folk here arent aware of what folklore actually is. Its stories verbally told to one another! Thats also how the irish folk collection has been seeing folklore now. Conclusion? I had an amazing time. It might not be your traditional museum, but it is one true to its quest so to speak. If youre looking for a way to truly experience irish folklore in its truest form, do not look further then this! They also have amazing books and every single storyteller is very passionate about their work which is lovely to see. Definite recommend, better then staring at statues im not even allowed to touch nor can experience! Notes; i think this storytelling experience is amazing for blind folk, i would recommend it less to deaf folk or bad of hearing people, as itll probably be hard to keep up. Hope they get accessible stuff for that soon too! The museum is wheelchair accessible. Also reminder; this is literally a small business. Thats why its a tad more expensive! But atleast you get your moneys worth and am not giving it to thieves like in the british museum (; Reviewing this attraction is really difficult: The actual service provided was very good. However, it was not what the name of the attraction suggests you are getting, and that is a major drawback if not a disappointment. This is really not a  leprechaun museum  at all. There are no exhibits at all that would merit the title  museum . You cannot do a self-guided tour of it, and it completely relies on a guide to impart the information. (So may not be suitable for visitors whose English is at basic level.) It is really an  Irish storytelling experience  - and the storyteller, Evan, was really great. He was engaging and enthusiastic, funny, occasionally irreverent, but overall very entertaining. However, the eponymous leprechauns only feature in a couple of stories. The whole experience would benefit from getting a more accurate name and description online just so people aren t disappointed with what they end up getting. A must do when stopping through Dublin. While not a traditional museum, my son and I had a wonderful time enjoying the art of storytelling. Our guide was energetic and passionate. It really allows you to put the cell phone down and connect in a different way. Guided tour only! If you are not bilingual, do not go there, you really need a very, very good level of English to understand all the stories that are told to us. It s a very beautiful museum, we go from room to room listening to Irish tales, which seem fascinating!! We were expecting to see giant furniture as if we were the size of a leprechaun but there is very, very little! My husband and I went there yesterday evening for the DARK LAND tour. We did not know what to expect so we went there open minded. It is indeed a little tour through 3 different locations - a little hut, the woodland and the coast. Our host Sarah told the stories quite exciting and with the right amount of chill. Fluent English is an advantage, because she tended to speak quit rapidly with a few dark or dirty jokes on the side. But altogether a very thrilling and entertaining experience! Highly recommend. I heard this was a story telling experience and I already knew that stories are an important part of Irish culture. However, I couldn t have guessed how riveting the tales would be. I was on the edge of my seat! Molly painted images with beautiful language and a haunting voice. I will recommend this 45 minute experience to anyone traveling through Dublin. If you think it is really for kids and families you would be mistaken. (Although they might enjoy it too.) Fantastic storytelling by our host, but this is not a museum - no artefacts or evidence of these mysterious creatures  . A 45 minute story but a very overpriced experience Visited on such a unique, interesting & fun experience! the staff are very friendly, passionate & charismatic. highly recommend! This  museum  was recommended to us by a family friend who visited it a while ago. We were looking forward to our visit and seeing all of the displays that are posted on older reviews. None of it exists today!!! We only had a person telling us stories. Unfortunately, it was very difficult for some people to understand because of the accent and very fast speaking. If English is not your first language, you will find yourself sitting in 3 different spaces and not understanding most of it I enjoyed the stories because I was able to understand but the other guests in my party were bored and tired of sitting on wooden benches for an hour. We left disappointed and had much higher expectation after recommendation that we received. Certainly not worth the price! The employees were truly incredibly kind. The story counter played along and put us in the mood. We havent seen time pass to the point where once its over, we hope it continues for another hour. Highly recommended for people who love folklore and stories 5/5 stars Wow! Boscos performance at the National Leprechaun Museum blew us away! Her storytelling is pure magic - she brings Irish myths to life like no one else. We were so amazed, we had to chat with her after the show. If you want real Irish culture, this is it! Boscos talent is off the charts, making this the absolute highlight of our Dublin trip. Dont even think about missing this gem - its entertaining, eye-opening, and totally unforgettable. A must-see for any Dublin visitor! Leprechauns? No. Museum? Still no. The story telling was enthusiastic but had i had known there was going to be so much shouting and drum banging by the guide I would not have booked. Not a single mention of leprechauns, just fairies. And nothing about this place was a museum, just a low budget theatrics centre. Between the shouting, drumming and the poorly placed unnecessary blue light in one room, i left with a banging headache. The girl at the front desk was sweet though. It was amazing, so much fun! Tour guide/storyteller told the stories in a beautiful and vivid way. The decorations looked really nice too. Truly enjoyed it. I was lucky that there was a ticket left though, so its good to book beforehand. Its not a museum in a literal sense, but its a blast! What is preserved here is the art of storytelling and stories of Irish folklore. Emmet was amazing at telling fun and interesting stories, setting the mood and bringing magical scenes to life. He even played the Irish flute for us! An amazing experience all around :) We really enjoyed this experience at the Leprechaun Museum. Emmet was our story teller and he was very entertaining and passionate about his Irish heritage. The experience is fully interactive with a fantastic story teller. Highly recommended for adults and children. It is imaginative, creative and entertaining. Our party was an adult, a senior and a 6 year old. We had a fantastic time there. Bosco took us on an adventure through some of Irelands folklore and myth, done in the proper old storytelling way. He was a fantastic actor and storyteller, couldnt recommend it enough. This was a very entertaining event... The dark tour for adults only was definitely worth the visit. Paudie, our guide, was very funny and a great singing voice. Great to learn some of Irelands folklore... Though not too much about Leprechauns. If you have the time, then pop in and experience for yourself. I went with my children and two foreign visitors. The experience was great for me and my children. The tour guide was very good and captivating in his story telling. However, the two foreign visitors could not understand a word. It s very hard to understand from the website what to expect as a visitor to the museum. Had I known what to expect I wouldn t have brought the two foreign visitors. The tour is targeted at native English speakers. If you think you wouldn t be able to understand theatre then no point in going, waste of money. Not all tourists are native English speakers, you should make it clear on the webs that it s story telling and there is nothing there to see or read about the subject. Very expensive mishap. Our guide Brandon (I think this was his name) was a wonderful storyteller and he was hilarious! The gift store had some cool books and my mate loved one of the books I gifted him. If you come to Dublin, I would recommend visiting the museum Wow! The storytelling was so great! Even my kids mentioned how great the storytelling was. Highly recommended visit, especially with children. We learned more about authentic Irish folklore which is different from what Walt Disney made. Amazing experience here, loved every second of it, I wish it was longer! Our tour guide, Emmett, was incredibly knowledgeable and lively and truly an incredible storyteller. I really love how this museum intentionally engages in traditional storytelling to present the knowledge, because that s how it has always been done, as he said! :) Truly loved every second of this museum and I loved the traditional storytelling of it, I wish more museums were like this. I thought it was great!  I enjoyed hearing the folklore behind the leprechauns and fairies in Irish mythology.  My tour was done by a woman named Sarah, who is also writing a book about Irish legends and folklore, and she was amassing!  I would recommend and I wouldn t go back without a doubt! I was extremely looking forward to visiting this museum so that I could complete my end-of-year dissertation. And I honestly wasn t disappointed! The visit was very interesting to learn more about Irish folklore. She was accompanied by a guide to explain the history and birth of these folklores to us, while leaving it to us to explore each room we visited. My only regret is that the visit was not very long, but it remains superb, both for young and old! This is not a museum for the average person, but catered towards a niche that is open to the tradition of storytelling. The museum is focused on sharing the legends/myths of Ireland through the traditional means - storytelling. I.e. this isn t the kinda space where you re gonna get cool insta photos or spend your time reading plaques; you are instead invited into an environment where stories are shared and felt and the imagination is lit awake. I enjoyed it thoroughly especially the navigation through the different rooms to share different stories. A wonderful story telling experience. A mix of fact and fantasy. The rooms we walked through to hear different stories in were beautifully done. The staff member at the till was grumpy and not very pleasant (maybe just having a bad day). Visited on This museum was unlike any other I ve been to, in a positive way. It s a multimedia venue but was unlike anything else as it revolves around storytelling. You have a personal guide/storyteller & it s very entertaining. It revolves around Irish history, culture & mythology. I found it to be one of the more unique things I ve done in a while. This was an amazing tour to stop in at and deserves every bit of praise and recognition. While visiting Dublin as a whole, our impression was this was a city struggling to find an identity. It s very much a modern and international city, but everywhere you go is the reminder of the suffering that the city and the country as a whole has struggled with for centuries In visiting this museum we were able to see a side of Dublin otherwise glossed over or forgotten. Listening to the stories of folklore through Sarah was a unique and fulfilling experience. We were were so impressed with the first visit we returned for the Darklands tour which has a whole new set of excellent stories and folklore. This museum is an absolute gem and is a must for anyone who is looking for a genuine experience of Irish folklore. The respect that Sarah and the rest of the staff has for the Irish traditions truly shine through as they pay tribute to Irish storytelling. This was fantastic!! I could have sat and listened for 3 more hours with no issues. We expected a museum to walk around and half read some posters and be in and out in 20 mins, but no! The guide sits you in these amazing scenes and tells you stories about Irish folklore and mythology and how stories have come about. It was fascinating and entertaining. The guide was brilliant in his delivery and kept us all on tenterhooks. 10/10 would recommend. Absolutely recommend this. Wonderful, funny and informative storytelling, with a focus on the folklore of Leprechauns. We didn t book so waited an hour but had a Guinness in the Boar s Head, which added to the whole experience! Fabulous book store too. Had such a great tour. Sarah the guide/storyteller/all round fantastic person was brilliant! So full of knowledge and really told the legends and tales with so much enthusiasm. Lovely to learn more about our history. Definitely worth a visit! (edited review from November 2023) I didnt know what to expect at first but it turned out to be a wonderful experience. It is not a museum  but rather a storytelling experience. The guide was so enthusiastic that it was so mesmerizing to listen to him telling stories. Definitely recommended if you are interested in Irish folktales in general as the tour does not focus on leprechauns only. Its such a wonderful experience. They also have a tiny store where they sell many kinds of books of Ireland and Irish folklore. We had such an amazing experience here! Our guide Mark was an outstanding and captivating storyteller. We could easily have stayed there the entire day listening to the great stories and folklore. Would highly recommend as one of the top places to visit in Dublin and has been one of our favourite experiences on our trip!"
131,National Museum of Ireland - Natural History,4.4,"My visit to the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History was an immersive journey into the captivating realm of the natural world. Nestled in Dublin, this museum, also known as the Dead Zoo, is a treasure trove of biodiversity, offering visitors a glimpse into the wonders of nature through its extensive collection of specimens. As I stepped into the museum, I was greeted by the grandeur of its Victorian-era architecture, which exuded a sense of history and nostalgia. The building itself was a testament to the museums rich heritage, providing a fitting backdrop for the awe-inspiring exhibits that awaited inside. The museums collection spans a wide range of natural history disciplines, including zoology, geology, and paleontology, with each gallery offering a unique perspective on the diversity of life on Earth. From towering skeletons of prehistoric giants to delicate taxidermy specimens of exotic birds and mammals, every corner of the museum was filled with wonders to behold. One of the highlights of my visit was the museums iconic Balcony of Beasts, where rows of glass cases displayed a menagerie of animals from around the world. From lions and tigers to elephants and giraffes, the lifelike dioramas offered a glimpse into the habitats and behaviors of these magnificent creatures. Moreover, the museums educational displays and interactive exhibits provided valuable insights into topics such as evolution, ecology, and conservation, making it an enriching experience for visitors of all ages. Whether it was learning about the geological history of Ireland or discovering the intricate adaptations of insects, there was always something new and fascinating to explore. Overall, my visit to the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History was a truly memorable and enlightening experience. With its extensive collection, informative exhibits, and historic ambiance, this museum serves as a testament to the beauty and diversity of the natural world, inspiring wonder and curiosity in all who visit. Great place. Upstairs was closed for renovations but it was still good. Can be quite busy but lots to see and find out about. Built is the 1800s this building is full of curiosities, (stuffed creatures), that would have been incredibly popular in the victorian era, currently the top floor is closed, due to refurbishment, however, there is still lots to see. It is free and well worth a visit. Awesome Museum! Animals on the ground floor were very cool to learn about and where they may have previously roamed around Ireland. Giant deer skeletons were very epic. Shame that the two upper floors are closed due to the roof being refurbished as it looks like they had some very impressive stuff up there. Although it sounds like it will be closed for a long time yet. What a surprising treasure! Full of faithfully preserved wildlife from birds, fish to foxes to wild Irish deer (enormous!!) and everything in between. And its free! Love it! Even love it more after realizing the animals I saw were all real samples, which means that the  dead zoo  is legit! Fancinatdd by some creatures such as the size of an eagle, some super huge fish, Irish giant deer etc. it was an amazing experience, will definitely visit again Unique Museum with a big virety of different animals from different habitats. Great for a day out with the children. Also was recently renovated, so the second floor was closed when visited. Small but very A visit to the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History is a truly enriching experience that I highly recommend to all nature lovers and history enthusiasts. From the moment you step inside, you are transported into a world of wonder and discovery. The museums impressive collection of natural specimens is both extensive and fascinating. From towering dinosaur skeletons to intricate insect displays, there is something to captivate visitors of all ages. The detailed exhibits are educational and engaging, providing a deeper understanding of the natural world and its biodiversity. The museum itself is a beautiful architectural gem, with its grand Victorian-style building and intricate ironwork. The ambiance is peaceful and serene, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the wonders of nature at their own pace. Overall, the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History is a hidden gem that deserves to be explored and appreciated. Its a place where you can learn, marvel, and connect with the natural world in a meaningful way. Dont miss the opportunity to visit this treasure trove of natural history! It will take approx one hour to see evrything. Great place for taking a short break to feel warm during rainy/cold days. Great place for kids!! They cant touch these things but see them. Visited on Weekend The sea organs and insects collections are pretty good and definitely worth visiting if you love to have a look at the fossils. Definitely a visit for kids to know and learn . I do wish they could have more things next after the renovation. Built in 1856, and opened in 1864, the Natural History Museum of Ireland is always worth a visit in opinion.  I remember seeing the displays as a child and the memories stuck with me to this day. Entrance is free and the building sits complementing the National Gallery on the other side of Leinster Lawn. Id prescribe no plan when entering and just discover whatever takes your interest.  For me, the giant deer skeletons,  which used to roam Ireland always make me draw a breath by virtue of their sheer size. There are many specimens of animals of all types.  Children love it.  And the best thing is that its free. Really cool spot! I had no idea there were so many animals in Ireland. Loved all the marine animals and the deer. And the puffins! Would recommend, very cool. Beautiful museum with free entry, but unfortunately it has been under renovation for ages. It was closed for a long time and a big part of the collection is still inaccessible to the public. The objects that are on display are lovely and interesting, but I do miss more interactive elements and also benches for people to sit and draw. Also not a fan of how they have closed off the roof inside as it makes the main room feel more cramped and dark, but hopefully the renovations will be done soon. As it is currently, you can browse the museum in less than 1 hour. It is also just a few minutes walk from the National Gallery of Ireland if you are interested in art. Dropped in today at lunchtime, not very busy  and easy to walk around at a leisurely pace. Upstairs was closed off so only had the ground floor to view. Relatively small museum and could spend less than an hour here. It is free to enter so worth the visit if you re close by. Visited on Weekday I had an amazing time at the Dublin Museum of Ireland! Its a fantastic place for both children and adults to learn about and observe wildlife. The habitats are well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The second floor was closed, so it felt like we missed out on a lot of other exhibits,  but the specimens on the first floor were really great, and its nice to see the representation of local species. Good for bring children for knowledge but went visit there the top stairs is was close , so only downstairs their open. One of the three national museums. A good place to spend time with children. Educational and free to visit. Great place to visit. Unfortunately they are in the process of renovation which will take 4-8 years and the main attractions are not accessible. Otherwise, a nice way to spend an hour. The kids loved it. Just the ground floor open at the moment (and for the foreseeable future from what I hear) but a great, quite place to spend an hour. National museum of Ireland - natural history is one of the finest museums in Ireland. The  building consists of  more than 3000 species preserved carefully to public. The place contains the smallest and biggest creatures in earth and water . There are different varieties of birds , animals, insects , fishes which are kept for public attraction. The renovation is undergoing inside the building ,so I havent got a chance to visit the 2nd floor. Expecting it will be open soon . Check for the reports before visiting otherwise you will miss the same as mine. The best place to visit with family and kids. The place will rejuvenate your mind surely. The entry museum is free. small but well-kept museum with numerous animals of all species. open every day until 5pm, excluding some national holidays. Free entrance. Great museum! At the momentn only ground floor is available for viewing. Very crowded on weekend. Visited on The 1st floor was closed so we only had access to the ground floor. It s a nice experience and good for a rainy day. Nothing I hadn t seen before. Great museum to learn about the natural history of Ireland and around the world.  The exhibits are frozen in time and are displayed as they would have been over 100 years ago.  Cost is free to enter. I absolutely loved attending the archaeology museum of Dublin. It was in a lovely old building and had fascinating pieces. They did a great job walking you through the very first civilizations in Ireland all through the different errors. I felt like I learned a lot about neolithic Ireland. They also had a gorgeous Special exhibit on all the gold that they have discovered from those time periods. From Irish wildlife to exotic species, the exhibits are both educational and intriguing. The museum is particularly great for families, offering an engaging way for kids to learn. While some may find the old-school presentation a bit dated, it adds to the museums unique character. Its not as interactive as modern natural history museums, but its charm and comprehensive collection make it worth a visit. Too sad the second floor was closed due to renovation, but i cant complain as the entrence was free. Used as part of a BAFA animation, lots of small animals can be discovered in this zoo of the dead (aka the dead zoo) Interesting natural museum. The second floor was closed. And it was a little bit noisy, probably because I visited it on a Saturday... Probably the worse museum Ive ever been to. More national embarrassment than national museum. It consisted of one big room filled with random stuffed animals.  Little to no information about the animals. No learning to be had. Noting tying the exhibitions together.  Nothing interactive. Many of the exhibits were in a state of poor upkeep, such as basking shark held together with gaffa tape. I wouldnt waste your time going here. Great place to visit and to see so many different stuffed animals in see through boxes and to see large amounts of insects to the tinyiest snails. I really admire reading about the butterflies. Great exhibition. The old-school displays are a real highlight. I love learning about the places we visit and no better place than this museum. We spent the better of an hour here looking through all of the interesting artifacts and reading information. The museum covers a lot and is up to date with current challenges such as how plastics have become our biggest (and smallest) polluter in this world. So worth the time, do plan to visit! Small but very good museum . Free entrance.  Good for kids . I traveled here to see the space where they filmed Penny Dreadful. Sadly, that space has been under renovation for the last 2ish years. All was not lost though! There is a lot to see and explore on the main floor. And, if given the chance, listen to the lovely gentlemen at the front counter. If youre kind they will absolutely share what they know... Which is a lot! Im so so pleased. Too bad the room upstairs is not accessible, were still hungry! The stuffed animals are displayed as a sort of everyday scene, its very nice, on the other hand it sometimes lacks a little explanation, especially for the marine animals. Nothing French A fascinating place to visit and its free too! This is a really great place to take young kids. So much to look at and learn about. I believe it will be closing again soon for another huge renovation as the building is 100+ years old and still has all the old Victorian flooring and ceilings etc. I spoke to one of the staff and was amazed how informed he was at the history of that building and the  museum -  really great staff. First, this is FREE.  We did not get the full experience as the 2nd floor was off-limits, which is fine. So we saw one floor and were greater by a massive Irish Deer.  Lots to look at and read. Good for a variety of ages.  Probably about 1-2 hours depending upon the group size and makeup. Support with a donation, of course. Great place to visit, I found it informative for me and my kids. They were very excited to see all these species. I was amazed, Irish deer was huge. It is very thoughtful how they maintained these so many species, some of them were from 18th century. Only ground floor was open  ."
132,National Museum of Ireland-Decorative Arts & History,4.7,"This museum has a very wide range, from silverware through historical clothes to furniture. I had a wonderful time wandering through these converted barracks, taking in the informative displays. And its free to enter, too. Not exactly what I expected if i am being honest but it was quite peaceful and beautiful regardless. However I encountered a room full of mannequins and have never ran out so fast. Realized I had a phobia that day. They look absolutely realistic and creepy I couldn t even focus on the fashion. Great museum overall though if you want a peaceful walkthrough A museum with free admission. The exhibition features very good artefacts. However, the display of these artefacts and in particular the lighting could be much better. Great place you need lots of time to look around properly, well worth a visit Free entrance check the website for updates before your visit Large numbers of art crafts displayed Quiet and beautiful you can spend couple of hours without being disturbed Jewelry collection in display covers design, metals and timeline It is very nice and huge museum  . It is a good museum and please take 1 entire day for this. They also have a small coffee van and a restaurant inside. A must visit! Very helpful staff, lovely curio shop that I returned to the next day to go buy a gift. Only saw half the museum as our time was limited. Beautiful exhibitions, curators choice is a must-see and by far our favourite! We loved the interactive exhibitions. The information given was wonderful to read. We will go back to see more. Nice place to know the history of Ireland. Beautiful and valuable collection. Amazing painting s ..very nice staff all around great experience overall A lovely free museum with a great variety of exhibitions on design, architecture, fashion, furniture, war and more. You can tell that some exhibitions are aged but they are all still very informative. The layout is nice and straightforward, because the museum is a square shaped building. Good way to spend some time if you re in the area, museum is grand and spacious with beautiful green spaces outside. Conveniently located at a red line Luas stop, the National Museum of Ireland is an architectural gem, with its massive and impressive structure. The best part? Entry is free. Inside, youll find diverse sections covering Irish war history, details about the famine, and a fascinating array of artifacts from around the world. As a history enthusiast, the artifacts were truly captivating a must-visit for anyone interested in rich historical collections. Excellent museum with free admission. Asks for a small donation which is optional but recommend as they do work hard and are all friendly. Lots to do. Lots to see. Spread over 3 floors with some beautiful designed exhibitions. Little miffed the coffee shop has gone as would have loved a coffee,cake and a sit down as a lot of walking around the building. The large reception are would be a beneficial place for a coffee area as this is where everyone enters & exits through. Just a food for thought! A Cultural Gem with a Heartwarming Commitment. One of my greatest joys when traveling is witnessing governments embrace and champion culture and the arts for all. In Ireland, the fact that nearly all museums are free is a celebration in itself! The museum, a vast treasure trove of art and history, demands several hours to explore fully. What truly shines is the dedication to accessibility. Every space is thoughtfully designed to ensure that people with limited mobility or those using wheelchairs can fully partake in the experience. Moreover, I was delighted to discover that the exhibitions here are framed with a gender perspective, showcasing a commitment to inclusivity and diversity. My heartfelt congratulations go to the curators for the exceptional curation of the exhibits and to the dedicated museum staff for their hard work. Its heartening to see a museum that not only values its art but also the people who come to admire it. I eagerly look forward to returning for another enriching visit. Very informative space about the history of Ireland. Some interactive sections alongside many artifacts, replicas and props to create the story of the war. The history section took us 40 minutes to walk through, with multiple rooms. And at the end finishing off in a room for geology which was also very interesting and designed well. Accessible entrances, elevators and assistance given at the front desk. Free to enter. Good for any age range Recommend a visit for the day Wonderful place to visit while in Dublin. Easy access with the Luas (public train fairly cheap) and free to the public. So many beautiful and informative things to see and the place is HUGE. You could easily spent an entire day there, and they have exhibits covering everything from the military history of Ireland, to its geology, geography, arts, and fashion. Not to mention the building it is located in is both historic and beautiful. Greatly enjoyed my time there. If you like museums and history a must to check out. Even just for the building. Free entrance too. I was too short there, one hour. You need more time to stroll around care free. Last minute I had booked for the Dublin Castle, on time slot. So I was in a hurry. But in 1 hour youve walked through the Dublin castle. The part that is open for the public, pretty small compared to National Museum of decorative arts. Best is to safe the national museum for last, if you are doing a museum day out. No time slot needed plus no entrance fee. There is also a gift shop. Which I had no time to check out unfortunately. Next time for sure. The National Museum of Ireland, with its diverse and rich collections, offers a deep dive into the countrys extensive history and cultural heritage. Situated across several sites, each branch of the museum provides a unique window into different aspects of Irish life, art, and natural history. The Archaeology branch, located on Kildare Street in Dublin, is a treasure trove of ancient artifacts. It boasts an impressive array of Celtic and medieval artifacts, including the renowned Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch, which are marvels of craftsmanship and design. The exhibition on the Viking era is particularly captivating, offering insight into the daily lives and intricate artistry of these influential settlers. The layout is generally well-conceived, with chronological progression that aids in understanding the historical context. However, the space can sometimes feel cramped, especially during peak tourist seasons, which can detract from the overall experience. The Decorative Arts and History branch, housed in the historic Collins Barracks, presents a wide array of objects ranging from weaponry and furniture to costumes and ceramics. This site effectively illustrates the evolution of Irish decorative arts and the broader social and political changes over centuries. The military history section is particularly well-curated, providing a detailed narrative of Irelands complex and often tumultuous past. One critique is that the sheer volume of items on display can be overwhelming, potentially leading to exhibition fatigue. More interactive displays and multimedia presentations could enhance visitor engagement and learning. The Natural History branch, affectionately known as the  Dead Zoo,  offers a fascinating glimpse into the natural world with its extensive taxidermy collection. While this branch has a certain old-world charm, it has faced criticism for its outdated displays and lack of modern interpretive materials. Plans for refurbishment are in place, which will hopefully address these concerns and rejuvenate the exhibition spaces, making them more accessible and engaging for contemporary audiences. Lastly, the Country Life branch in County Mayo provides an immersive experience into the rural history of Ireland. The exhibits here are thoughtfully presented, highlighting the daily lives, crafts, and traditions of rural Irish communities. This branch is particularly praised for its interactive elements and educational programs, which bring history to life for visitors of all ages. Overall, the National Museum of Ireland excels in presenting the country s rich heritage across its various branches. Each site offers a unique perspective and depth of content that is both educational and engaging. With ongoing improvements and updates, particularly in the Natural History branch, the museum continues to be a pivotal institution for preserving and interpreting Ireland s past. The primary areas for enhancement include better spatial management in the Archaeology branch and more modern, interactive displays to cater to a diverse and international audience. Enjoyed this museum immensely. Lots of history about Ireland. The courtyard is a sight to behold.  You can spend quite a lot of time examining everything or walk leisurely through fairly quickly. Great museum! Lots of different exhibits, and much to choose from depending on what you would like to see. We really liked the fashion exhibit and the Asian exhibit in particular. The flow of the museum really works as you go from room to another and it makes sense. We happened to go on a day when there was a big GAA match happening in town so the museum was completely empty and I think that added to the experience as it was more pleasant that way. Definitely go when it s empty, worth a visit! Awesome museum with no charges to see.  Theres a place if u fell up for a  donation.  Impossible to see all in one visit!!! Theres 3 floors with so much that i cant describe in a simple review.  Only the building it self its already admirable.. highly recommend more than 2 visits. One of my favorite museum in town. My father is in the French military and the museum was extremely interesting from the beginning to the end. A lot of explanations, history, and it was also very educational. You can clearly come with children. Also the receptionist was so nice, we talked with her, thank you!! I would definitely come again. Huge selection of War related materials and relics. Theres a free guided tour and the admission is free as well. The building is massive and very clean. Staff is super nice. I found that the geology section was rather a beginners exhibition but it must be rather interesting for kids. You can take pictures without the flash. Thursday is long opening hours and there are generally not so many ppl. Havent been there yet I visited here with my friend to mark International Womens Day. We wanted to take part in the tour of the  role of women in the struggle for Irish independence.  This was a superb tour enhanced by the presence of a granddaughter of one of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation. This was a unique experience laid on by the Museum for the day that was in it. Way better than expected from the simple name. Extensive collection of well displayed make artifacts from all across history. Took me two days to see the whole place. :O The back room of off-display artifacts was particularly cool. Super interesting if you want to understand the last 300 years of Irish history, the complex military relationship with England and the struggle to independence and self-discovery as a nation. Amazing as a foreign person. Don t miss a visit to the side exhibit about the Asgard. I am speechless after witnessing this building, it is 250yrs old building and stand like a giant. Building itself a master piece they maintained it so well. I found this museum awesome, astonishing. You can not digest all its things in a single day. I will visit it again soon. Several different collections on display. Some were really impressive, and others didnt really speak to me. I would still suggest giving this museum a visit. Overall, this location is highly recommended! Great museum, its not transcendent, but we wanted to go there because I love old furniture, there is a collection of silver, furniture from the 19th century to the 1980s, magnificent dresses! If you have time go for it otherwise it doesnt matter. Its free. The Museum was very interesting and I learned quite a lot! Its a must see for every tourist. Its free, its huge (so plan some time) and it has two separate sections - decorative & arts and military history of Ireland! It is a Free Museum with 2 exhibitions, one for history and military, and the other for decorative arts and mode. Each one is divided into parts and it leads you to every floor of the Museum. We did it in thesame day as going to the Zoo in Phoenix Park, a good itinerary to do to visit both Phoenix Park and this Museum at thesame day. In the West side of Dublin. If you like history, it will be a valuable place to visit in Dublin.  I saw the Asgard, a ship used to bring guns to Ireland before 1916, and other things like coins used in different periods. What I remember is the clothes that people wore in the past. They are very different to today. I think these clothes were popular not just in Ireland but also in all Europe. I met a few children and teenagers in the museum and I think children will enjoy this place. The museum is enormous, you can find countless pieces of art, paintings and objects from all over the world. You really need more than a couple of hours to visit all the building, and if you want to know about history and recent conflicts in Ireland, its the place to go. The real size wax figures were impressive, as the machinery and objects displayed, like the planes. The building is a really wonderful piece of architecture and a beautiful place to walk outside on a nice sunny day, we were because there was an outside fair and had a great day. We enter for free and the staff was so kind and willing to help. Definitely will be coming back. The weirdest national museum I ever seen baybe because it was before a army school, nice collection Neat use of the old barracks building. Youll want to spend around 2 hours walking around to see most everything depending on which exhibits they have available. Its an interesting and informative way to take shelter from the rain on a dreary afternoon. My favorite museum experience in Dublin. Exhibits are engaging and memorable.  Well worth the trip.  Admission is free but leave a donation.  The exhibits are far better than any of the pay to see venues.  This museum is a gem. Free entry It s laid out very well A very interesting museum - there is a separate exhibition of numismatics and money that was used in Ireland, an exhibition of furniture from different eras in retrospect - and it is incredibly cool) an exhibition of household items made of gold and silver - incredibly delicate work ... also a lot of very interesting and interesting things - in my opinion  - you need to spend a couple of days to see all the treasures in the museum La partie du musee sur l histoire de l Irlande est genial ! Tres belles pieces, histoires interessantes, detaillees, bien racontees et concises. On comprends vraiment tout sur l histoire belliqueuse de l Irlande. Le musee n est pas forcement tres amusant pour un enfant cependant. Il est tres grand, et l entree est gratuite ! Je recommande vivement this museum was bigger than expecting and had a great range of exhibitions for a free museum! It wasnt too busy. I particularly enjoyed the modern war part of the museum. Theres too much to do in one day so id recommend a couple of visits Huge museum! We got lost..... Interesting and varied. You have to spend several hours there..."
133,National Trust - Carrick-a-Rede,4.6,"Really stunning views and scenery, especially when the sun is out, the water looks so blue almost tropical. Brilliant for a walk also. Only downer was the price to walk the bridge PS15.50 for 1 adult to walk over a 10 meter if even bridge. Free to national trust members tho. One of the best place to visit in Northern Ireland. Eccentric view from the cliff and the bridge is really spectacular. We need to buy tickets to enter the place. We can either buy it online or can buy it when you reach there. Online will be preferable as we would get to know the timings and status of the open/closure of the bridge. Tickets can be booked from the below link: https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/northern-ireland/carrick-a-rede We were so lucky coming on a nice day, views were lovely. We didn t  have to wait for our turn on bridge too long. Steps going down to bridge are steep and I felt worse than walking over the bridge it s self which was rather sturdy. Bridge looked a little awkward for those with young children as they couldn t hold on both sides. Cafe was nice with toilets and quite a large car park. Nice place to soak in the warm chilly summer weather. You ve gotta pay if you wanna walk on the rope bridge tho I d suggest walking a little further down to catch a nice vantage point of the bridge, cliffs and sea. Free view of the beautiful nature! This one will bring  out the wobbly knees in the best of us!  A great car park,  I believe free if you have booked ahead.   A 15 minute gentle walk followed by a steep stepped decent to the bridge itself.  Its all very exciting, however, not much to do on the other side - 10 minutes  will have it done and dusted.  Great views back to the cliffs, though, and keep an eye out for puffins. A unique experience, but only for those who are strong at heart and do not suffer from vertigo! Its literally crossing a rope bridge! But its so worth it! The ticket is quite expensive, but I think overall it will be a good experience. It is possible to take a walk along the local cliffs, which is also a fantastic experience with impressive views! There is only parking for cars, buses cannot get off. There is an observation station at the top of the hill with information signs about the place. Great for learning and relaxing a bit! I recently visited Carrick-a-Rede and had an amazing experience. The location is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views of the rugged coastline and crystal-clear waters. The walk to the rope bridge is scenic and offers plenty of photo opportunities. Crossing the bridge itself is thrilling and offers a unique perspective of the surrounding landscape. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, providing interesting historical insights about the area. Overall, Carrick-a-Rede is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the natural beauty and adventure Northern Ireland has to offer. Lots of walking and hiking. There is a defibrillator oh sure in case someone passes out not because of the bridge but because of the 170+ rocky stairs one has to walk down to the bridge or up. It s a beautiful scenery and so well maintained. COOL, BUT SCARY WHEN WET & WINDY! Parked at the National Trust Car Park, everyone there is super friendly and will direct you on your way. When you get to the bridge, they check your tickets and you walk across. Its a lot more stable and wider than you think and the island you go to offers nice views around. The bridge WILL close due to bad weather or high winds, and I think they closed it immediately after I came back across because it was getting to be gale force and wet out there. Be sure to stop off at the coffee shop for a hot drink and free WiFi, because theres no signal out there. Worth doing, but go on a nice day to have the best experience. We had wonderful weather. It was a really nice walk to the bridge. Of course very windy on the bridge, but the small island is very beautiful with an awesome view. Its a stunning part of the country with some lovely views.  Theres plenty of parking, and then theres around 0.75 miles from walking down to the bridge.  Its mostly well surfaced, but the steps are made of stone so it can be slightly slippery. Carrick  a reede a rope  way connecting  the island     tip to the main  land. It is in county Antrim very  close  to  Causeway . Beautiful  dramatic  views  of the cliff , turquoise  water and plenty  of sea birds nesting on the cliffs.  The panoramic  views  are amazingly beautiful/ nature  at its best. There  is a cafeteria  and a car    park  for visitors.  Definitely  worth  a visit while  visiting  Causeway. 15,50 PS par personne pour passer un vulgaire pont de 5m de long. On ne peut meme pas profiter sur le pont puisqu ils nous font passer a la chaine par groupe d une dizaine de touristes et nous pressent << Come on! Come on!! >> Belle arnaque bravo a eux. (Je recommande la chaussee des Geants pour les memes points de vue et tout ca gratuit) This isba great place but we paid like 40PS just for crossing this beautiful but very small bridge I recommend to book in advance, you should have multi activities tickets for much cheaper, so be sure you ve got a lower price because worth to see it but for much less money Great walk and the bit over the rope is not as hair-raising as I thought it would be. But inconsiderate tourists taking photos can mar the experience a bit. Definitely worth a visit. Fun experience, short walk to get to the rope bridge and the queue to cross is not very long. There is also a rock quarry at the end of the parking lot that was used for a Got (Game of Thrones) scene that is a short walk. Located in Northern Ireland, facing Scotland, the ride/drive to this site was FUN! If youre a car enthusiast or love to drive, youll enjoy the drive to this site. The roads are weaving in and out, up and down, and you scale some nice hills with deep drops. Fun!! Youll thank me later haha. Recommend getting tickets in advance! The parking is free and there is a small dwelling with a cafe inside for some beverages and a snack. The tour was brief but informative, they discuss a lot of fun and unusual things I didnt know! Now the walk to the bridge is definitely moderate and not for those with cardiac issues. However, if you have a watch that monitors your heart rate then you can manage your heart rate and pace your walk. The walk is roughly a KM long so dress appropriately and dont bring your high end shoes unless theyre hiking worthy apparel! The bridge is not that long, BUT the drop is definitely steep. The bridge is well maintained so dont worry. The only thing you gotta worry about is the window and looking down haha, otherwise youre cool. The other side of the bridge is beautiful and a great place to relax and soak in the castle ocean in front of you! Beautiful site and beautifully kept bridge and nature. The tour was fun and informative! Highly recommend!! Such a surreal experience! Visited the rope bridge in December when on a solo road trip in NI. It was a moderately windy day and you could feel the wind when on the bridge. Sadly most of the island was roped off for safety reasons and the path to the fishermens hut too :( The staff were very friendly :) Would recommend booking tickets in advance or paying by cash or card as phone service is very poor for NFC. Also recommend collecting a kids activity page (Im an adult lol) but it tells you about the place and wildlife you could see :) Highly recommend! insta: vailancia.21 Must-see location, great views and lots of birds. We visited on a very windy day. I was holding on for dear life on the way back, but Im not a hero on heights ;-). We were the last to cross before they closed it for a few hours. A vigorous hike leads to breath taking views, a replica rope bridge to an island and steep hike to the top for great pasture views behind water views. Windy crossing was fun, it s a short experience for PS15 a person but there are birds nesting to see too. If this price is too high walking around the area is very beautiful tickets are purchased on the website.  toilets on site.  I think that 15.5p pounds per person is a lot for an attraction that is only the bridge.  beautiful views Visiting the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge remains one of our memorable adventures. The crossing itself, with its dizzying side, is an experience in its own right, but it is really on the other side that the show begins. The views are breathtaking: turquoise waters, steep cliffs and wild nature offer a panorama worthy of a film. The journey there and back is a charming stroll, a perfect time to appreciate the natural beauty of Northern Ireland. In short, Carrick-a-Rede offers much more than just a bridge crossing; it is a window onto wild and magnificent landscapes. A must-do for lovers of breathtaking landscapes. Remember to choose your time of visit carefully to take full advantage of this unique experience. The Carrick-a-Rede Bridge is indeed a rope bridge, and thrilling! But, it is almost too stable to be dangerous or exotic, lol It cost  17 per person to cross, I believe, and we had to walk about a kilometer to get there. So, I did not expect that, but it was fun anyway. The island is also pretty; seagulls nest not too far away from the walkway on the island. A pretty short but very expensive suspension bridge worldwide. But it s a nice place to visit anyway. You have to walk 20 minutes from the parking area. Absolute stunning, magical place, the walk to the bridge  was easy, clean, the climb back up isnt of the easy ones, I was carrying a toddler on my back but some people really struggled. If you have asthma or any  other lung occupying issues , please take care. Experience the adventure, walk across the bridge some 30 metres or so above Atlantic Ocean  On a good day worth going to and the place is beautiful with the surrounding views. A really cool site that is well worth the visit if in the area. It is about a 15 minute walk from the carpark and the bridge is a classic rope bridge which can be quite bouncy. If you have a fear of heights this is probably not a good place to visit as the hand-rope on the bridge is quite low for tall people. We actually backtracked to be able to make this stop. Originally we were going to go right after Giants Causeway but left there too late. The next day we actually drove back to be able to check this bridge out. There were very few people there on a weekday morning, and we actually had the bridge and viewpoint to ourselves for awhile. Bonus points that they filmed some of Game of Thrones here. It was overcast and windy the day we went but so beautiful. Delightful little walk with amazing views. Im not certain if it will be worth the price for everyone and when we went there the island was closed just over the bridge. It was a truly amazing experience. The bridge is a rope bridge spanning some 20 metres across a chasm between two rocks.The walk to the rope bridge is fairly easy, taking approximately 30 minutes one way, and the scenery along the way is stunning. Once you reach the bridge, it is an incredible experience. The bridge is a bit wobbly and a bit scary, but it is totally safe and you can enjoy the view from the bridge. It is truly an amazing experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Northern Ireland. *Public Car Parking Available * Toilet available * A small food court is available and you can have nice cup of Tea/ coffee. I would say its a hidden gem in northern Ireland. You cannot see the rope bridge from the road. The admission fee per adult is only if you want to walk through the bridge ( which is awesome anyways) you can park and walk through the trail until the bridge for breathtaking views A truly unmissable experience when visiting Northern Ireland! Very scenery especially on dry and sunny days! This was our first and most wonderful experience in Northern Ireland. The walk from the car park to the bridge was not only easy but also incredibly beautiful. Crossing the rope bridge was a pleasant experience, offering breathtaking views of the other side. Parking is free, but youll need to purchase tickets to cross the bridge, which is safe for anyone to walk. Restrooms are available at the car park, and youll also find an ice cream  and cafe. We visited on a sunny day and enjoyed ice cream upon our return. Beautiful and wonderful place, but its a good idea to check the weather forecast, as on my visit the bridge was closed due to the weather conditions. We visited the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge years ago when it was free to cross and you could explore the island. While I understand that the bridge needs to be maintained and the birds protected I feel cheated as for the money you pay nowadays youre literally only allowed to cross the bridge and walk 2 mins along a concrete pathway. Very disappointing :( Unless you really want to experience crossing a 20m rope bridge I suggest you save the money, take a picture from the mainland (yes, you can walk to the bridge for free), and turn around. Best to book ticket in advance or you wont be allowed in on a busy day.  We had showers n sunshine but still an amazing experience.  Dont miss two quarries there, massive kiln, crusher and landing space for rocks on the nearby tiny island.  Its much more than just a rope bridge. Nice coffee place, clean toilets. A great visit  but it is a difficult walk. Lots of stairs and slopes. It 1 km each way and I found it tough.  I am not the fittest and have some issues. But feel it was worth it. There are seat a plenty as you go along and they are just where you need them to be. Thr Bridge was exciting. A lovely scenic walk to get to the rope bridge. The bridge itself is a good experience, although can be a bit of a wait when you get to it. Its around fifteen minutes walk from the car park to the bridge.  There is plenty of space in the car park with an overflow option. Decent toilets in the car park too, and an ice cream shop (we did not try that to comment). A good experience. Id recommend booking a slot in advance to guarantee your entry and save on some queuing. An extremely beautiful place, with clear blue water and nice walk to the bridge. The bridge was created by fishermen to help catch salmon and we can also see a cottage ( no longer accessible) used by them. The entire place is well maintained and there is a cafe and toilets near the entrance. Must visit while in NI"
134,Network,4.7,"Excellent food and coffee. Got breakfast dishes and they kept us going the whole day even though we walked all around Dublin (12 km!) Really special coffee and creative dishes, highly recommend Food Cost cafe with great food and coffee. Had the avocado and fried egg toast which was delicious! If I came across this earlier I wouldn t have had to pay tremendous shipping cost buying Bonanza coffee beans from Berlin. I would recommend you try the nice coffee in Network, I couldn t replicate it even using same beans at home ;) Everything was fine until we saw the cook with a t-shirt full of stains.... hygiene didnt seem to be his problem. He comes to the cash register to take orders then returns to the kitchen. Did he wash my hands? In any case we expect a cook to be clean on him. This was not the case at all Best coffee and baked goods in Ireland and honestly, one of the best cafes in the world. So comfortable I could spend all day there (and do sometimes). Great place to work with free WiFi, welcoming environment and incredible food by chef Niall, and goes without saying, any coffee you desire served to perfection. Cosy and warm place with great service and delicious brunch This is my favorite cafe in Dublin, hands down. Espresso drinks are perfectly crafted, the food is completely above category - just absolutely terrific and unexpected. I had the porridge on my first visit and it was crazy good, and tried the Miso and Mushroom sourdough toast on my next visit and it was mind blowing. Service is on point, friendly and super efficient. 12/10 recommend. There are places we can go just because the staff is so nice (even if the food is only standard). Network is not one of those caffes. I mean, the staff is amazingly friendly but also the food and the coffee are great. The mocha is fantastic (not too sweet) and the almond croissant is a must try (again not too sweet and without that kind of strong cream that you usually can get in pastries that makes them seem like a candy). I want to visit them again. Network is renowned for its exceptional coffee, and rightfully so   they take their craft seriously, offering an impressive range of brews. However, if you visit, dont miss out on trying their smoked Gubbeen toastie with ham and pastrami. Unlike many other places where sandwiches can be stingy on the fillings, Network delivers generously sized, succulent pieces of meat that harmonize perfectly with the rest of the sandwich. Regrettably, I dont have a photo because I couldnt resist diving in as soon as it arrived. Gets a five star only for being dog friendly. But on top of that the food was delicious, the staff was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Only critic is how its a tad small so it gets tight for lunch. Other than that, definitely recommend this place. Has WiFi and is computer friendly. My plate was really spicy! Service... I dont  understand why I have to pay in advance! The atmosphere is a little bit noisy This cafe is more than a cafe in Dublin, its such a JEWEL with a friendly staff,  great food, and coffee!  I was in town for a few days and was referred to Network for coffee.  I visited Network each day I was in town for breakfast and to enjoy friendly people!  Thank you for making me feel comfortable in your pleasant cafe! Such a warm and cozy cafe in Dublin right near my college. They have some good pastries and cakes. Best cafe in Dublin? Most likely. Nice vibe, small but well designed inside with some seating (small bench outside). Consistently excellent food and drinks. My Americano is always excellent: smooth and balanced, opaque but clean cup, some sweetness. One of the few places in Dublin you ll find a coffee that isn t sour. Really like this cosy little cafe, the brunch is great, and the coffee is about the best around. Really super nice cafe close to the center. There are a few seats but not a lot so it can quickly seem full. The service is really great and they offer brunches as well as other cupcakes. The prices are quite high. It costs  3.50 for a hot chocolate. Cakes are around  3. Banana bread a bit sweet for my taste, but that does not detract from excellent coffee and service. I had a beautiful flat white here, and the staff were extremely friendly. The staff misread my friends order and it came out a bit late, and they went above and beyond to make up for that. Its the kind of place where they will recognize you and remember your name. Ill definitely be back! Great atmosphere in network cafe. Everyone is friendly. Zoe and James were so nice and suggested these two dishes for breakfast. and Im obsessed with the iced lattes and flat whites!. Its a great place if you want to chill out and catch up with friends. Music is a bonus in there. would highly recommend checking it out if you get the chance. It s my regular in Dublin City as I m in college across the road. Exceptional coffee with extremely consistent quality standards. Highly recommend. I went in here with my partner, she ordered a hot chocolate for me and I used the bathroom. When I came back from the bathroom, the staff members attitude had changed. I was asked is it just the bathroom that I wanted to use or am I getting a anything. Whatever confusion there was, Im sure that can happen but being told that he would drink it himself and I dont need to buy it but I explained I came in for a hot chocolate. Honestly everyone can have a bad day and maybe this is the case hopefully.    PS. The place was lovely and the hot chocolate was really nice despite everything else:) Calming yet cosy interior, friendly people. Coffee was pretty good but maybe don t get the mocha, couldn t really taste the choco at all. The levitating teaspoon effect is cool. Food has improved significantly and it s now much better! With a twist from the norm and good for the price. Although small, Network has a conducive atmosphere for solo folk to spend some alone time. I visited Network on a weekend afternoon and on a workday morning and theres always a great, cool vibe. The premises are bright and spacious, the baristas are friendly and the coffee is delicious. The first time I had a scrumptious cake, the second time I tried a single-origin oat flat white and sat down to read my book while watching people come and go. The presentation is also super cool, what with the spoon suspended in the magnetic board. You should not miss this place. Go now! A great place to made connections over some of Dublins best coffee and wholesome grub. Conveniently located for students in TUD, and anyone around The Green / Liberties area Amazing coffee! Need to ask what coffee beans they use when I go back Fantastic cafe. Food and coffee is delicious. Staff are super nice as well. The brunch bap is literally one of the nicest things in the world. Great quality and taste! Pro: Good vibe for working, not crowded in the morning. Matcha Latte is ok. Con: I was very disappointed at the  11 avocado toast - the avocado is totally raw and very hard - it is only a sourdough + avocado- very different from the beautiful picture I see in the review. Hope it can be improved. A decent menu and great food for the price. It is a small place that has really good vibe to it. The staff are quite friendly and make sure you feel right at home. The brunch bap is quite delicious and filling especially with their coffee, one of thr smoothest you can have. I had a really good coffee and a piece of tasty chocolate pastry. The barista was very nice and obliging. The prices were very good, which was probably due to the location a bit away from the  crowded pedestrian zone. The shop is highly recommended. Hot chocolate its not good at all, but the food and the atmosphere its okay, prices are a little bit expensive Well-rounded coffee with just the right notes of acidity. There are little tables, and they offer bites of little food if you re hungry, and otherwise they had a menu for more wholesome eats till 3pm - seemed to be quite interesting, with healthy options. They don t mind if you use your laptop for awhile, as long as it isn t peak hour. Cheers to the barista who offered me napkins to dry my hair from the lovely Irish weather and watched me being clumsy all over! Lovely place for coffee! Kind and welcoming baristas. Only point which could have made it better is that they should roast their own beans! Hands down Network provides the best coffee in Dublin. Ollie the owner is so welcoming and friendly, he gets to know all of his customers by name and his staff are so warm and energetic. Fantastic atmosphere, beautiful design aesthetic and incredible coffee - all of which comes without the usual side of pretension - what more could you want? The staff is lovely. Step in and have a flat white. Coffee is from 3fe. No seating outside. Great coffee place, minimalist bistro-like seating and funky wooden chais and trays, quite hipster. Nice. Dog friendly really good coffee - need to come back for the pastries! Had a delicious filter Kenyan from Network, and a great chat with friendly barista. Pastries looked incredible, though we did not try any. Hot chocolate also well made and of high quality. I got an avocado toast with sweet goats cheese, beetroot, and toasted pine nuts, and it was delicious! Service was quick, and staff was nice! Good coffee. Reasonable prices. Friendly staff. Decent WiFi. Dog friendly! Dairy free milk options. I d recommend. Filter coffee slaps and the vegan muffin was mind blowing. Traveled here from Nottingham and saw this place was recommended on Reddit. 10/10 worth the 30 min walk from the hotel"
135,O'Connell Monument,4.65,"The monument to Daniel OConnell in Dublin is located in the very center. The monument is dedicated to the legendary Irish politician. The four winged women located near the monument represent patriotism, courage, eloquence and loyalty. A very beautiful monument, impressive not only for its details, but also for the history of this famous person. This corner of the city ow lovely. It has some old buildings and nice architecture The OConnell Monument, a towering tribute to Daniel OConnell, is not just a statue; its a powerful symbol of Irelands struggle for independence and the enduring legacy of one of its most influential leaders. Daniel OConnell, known as The Liberator, was a driving force behind the movement for Catholic emancipation and the repeal of discriminatory laws against Catholics in Ireland. Designed by the esteemed sculptor John Henry Foley, the monument stands as a majestic landmark at the southern end of OConnell Street, Dublins principal thoroughfare. It was unveiled in 1882, years after OConnells death in 1847, as a fitting tribute to his tireless efforts to advance the cause of Irish freedom and equality. The monument itself is a masterpiece of Victorian-era sculpture and architecture. At its pinnacle stands a commanding statue of Daniel OConnell, depicted in a dignified pose, his outstretched hand gesturing toward the future. Surrounding him are four allegorical figures representing the virtues that defined his life and legacy: Patriotism, Fidelity, Courage, and Eloquence. These figures, crafted in bronze, serve as eternal guardians of OConnells vision and ideals. The monuments Corinthian column, rising over 50 feet into the Dublin skyline, is adorned with intricate carvings and ornamental details, a testament to Foleys artistic skill and craftsmanship. At its base, four bronze winged victories hold laurel wreaths, symbolizing the triumph of justice and the enduring spirit of the Irish people. Over the years, the OConnell Monument has become more than just a statue; its a place of pilgrimage, remembrance, and reflection for countless visitors from around the world. It stands as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought for Irish independence and a beacon of hope for future generations. As Dublins most iconic landmark, the OConnell Monument continues to inspire and unite the people of Ireland, reminding them of their shared history and the enduring values of freedom, justice, and equality for all. It remains a testament to Daniel OConnells indomitable spirit and his unwavering commitment to the cause of Irish liberation. I love all the monuments along the OConnell street, making it feel like walking through the Irish history. An unmissable historical monument in Dublin (just by its dimensions already). Its sculptures all around are imposing. Regularly squatted by seagulls at its summit, you can enjoy it day and night Nice monument, must see in Dublin. Unfortunately, there are many drug addicts and criminals there, and one does not feel safe Wonderful monument to a great Irishman, great humanity and true Patriot. Cool monument, but what s cooler is the bridge which it sits next to! The O Connel s bridge is as long as it is wide, fun fact! Very busy street lined up with tons of shops from restaurants to gift shops! Nice spot to watch Dublin go by , plenty of food shops near by to. Not a lot too see really,  3 or 4 photos on-line will show just as much as you can see standing in situ, mind u the standard selfie beside the statue is a trend.  Pay close attention to the metal of them statue and notice the holes.  They are bullet holes from the 1916 rising, theres a few Very nice monument built in honour of Daniel O Connell, byname The Liberator. He was a lawyer who became a famous Irish national leader. The monument is located in an extreme busy area, always packed with tourists. Watch the nice angels on each side of the monument. On your way to The Spire, coming from the bridge, its the first statue you will meet. This statues stands in OConnell Street in tribute to Daniel O Connell, the man they call the liberator. He is noted for having campaigned for Catholic emancipation and a time when there were laws that discriminated against then as well the right for Catholics to sit in the Westminster Parliament. The base of the monument has four winged figures representing Patriotism, Fidelity, Courage and Eloquence. Above this is a drum surrounded by figures representing O Connell s labours and triumphs. Finally the monument is topped with the figure of Daniel O Connell. Dont miss the QR code on the statue where you can hear an excerpt from Daniel OConnell All together Dublin is not as beautiful or as old as the other cities of mainland Europe but still worth seeing few things here and one of them is this; the OConnell Monument, a statue to an Irish national hero. historical statue, but not only worth it to see if you happens to be around. Otherwise, you can skip it. A very easy to and popular spot to meet strangers. I do not think there will be anyone in Dublin or who has visited Dublin, who will not know about the O Connel monument. It s at the center of the town and is an iconic monument which has stood the test of time. The music gigs that happen behind the monument on summer weekends are always a delight!! Big monument to the great Irish man Went down to Dublin with my Mammy has have a photo of my Daddy who wasnt that long passed away and the photo of him was taken at the monument in the 60s (I think) and wanted to retrace his steps.  Dublin is steeped in history and this monument is well worth the visit.  The monument was fenced off, so couldnt get right beside it, but at least they are maintaining it. It give you best scenic view when sky is clear Beautiful statue of Daniel OConnell, its a shame it was covered in Bird droppings when I saw it, hopefully itll be cleaned! Went there for St Patrick day parade, will come back to visit properly. Every time I come to Dublin I look at this first. It feels like Im back every time I see it. Being a Connell from Illinois, I found the monument welcoming. Our tour guide did a fantastic job of telling us about the history of OConnell. One of the beautiful and interesting statues/monuments around the city of Dublin, representing Irish culture/history/legacy. Located on the south side of O Connell Street, this statue/monument was unveiled in 1882, in honor of the great  Catholic Emancipator  Daniel OConnell, who was a major Irish political leader at the beginning of the 19th century. On top of   the statue you may find  Daniel O Connell, and at the base of the monument you see four winged victories, representing virtues attributed to O Connell: courage, fidelity, patriotism, and eloquence.   Impressive . pretty and warm, I always had a lot of respect for him #daniel Cool looking monument on the riverside. You wouldn t have been to Dublin if you did not see this magnificent monument. It s larger than life, stand tall in the middle of the city. You might think that it is 300 meters tall or more, you will be surprised that it is just 120 meters tall Very interesting and must see in Dublin Really picturesque spot. A blend of old and new architecture. A historic monument in Dublin always good for a gawk. A traditional perch in OConnell St during parades or just to meet someone to hang out having a chat and a take away. Since its so big its hard to miss. OConnell unfortunately is a target for seagulls so maybe best not to sit on monument steps themselves. An interesting history behind this monument and the history attached to the events that happened here A grand monument in the old style that honors one of Ireland s heroes. Magnificent unmissable monument on O connel street. The details are impressive. The flagship monument of this street for my taste! Located in the centre of the city. Worth seeing while visiting Dublin. This is the most busiest street in Dublin and sits right on top of the O Connell bridge. Good landmark to navigate by, and also worth a walk around to view the figures around the base.  Look closely to see bullet holes from the 1916 rising. What an amazing statue in the middle of the city center, and also I like when I take that photo a bird with open wings, love it. Located on the main thoroughfare in Dublin is the OConnell Monument, a statue to an Irish national hero: Daniel OConnell. Known as the Liberator, Daniel OConnell was born in Carhan, Caherciveen in 1775. After securing the passage of the Catholic Emancipation Act in 1829, he was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin. Beautiful statue can t miss it. Lovely work. There are numerous memorials to him around Dublin City. Not to be missed, pity the guide didnt talk more about the diversity of society represented in Glasnevin rather than focusing on 1916 mainly."
136,Old Liffey Ferry,4.575,"A fantastic family day out, the tour guide is amazing and the water was so nice to sail on when we went. A really enjoyable alternative way to see Dublin, I cant wait to go again, really nice and helpful staff. Sailing is weather permitted, but we were lucky to get a mild day. Highly recommended Nice experience with family or friends to have. Amazing crew members with one of them giving a full history and background of the events that happened here. Perfect during summer holidays but not so pleasant during rainy days as there is no cover. But raincoats are provided on deck incase. Really enjoyed my tour today, even if the weather wasnt the best. Just dress appropriately, and youre set (wool under your raincoat keeps you dry and toasty). Great to see Dublin from the water and to hear about this particular part of its history from Frank. Ten out of ten, would recommend! I had a trip scheduled for June 14th at 2:30 pm they sent me an email a few hours before saying it was going to be postponed due to weather conditions and then a few hours later they cancelled it. I have asked for my refund since yesterday with no response at all Even though I have used all possible channels to contact them: IG, FB, telephone and e-mail. Also when I call the phone number that appears on their page I get a tone saying that number does not exist. Wry small very personal. Two get guys. Get a whole new look from the water. They even made my grandsons day.  By making him captain. And letting him take the wheel. Lose the crowds and take a slow ride and get some stories and knowledge of the dock area. Heads up your gps might take you to the wrong place. It s next to the big restaurant boat  Cill Airne. It was great tour along the river, with lots of facts about Dublin. 4 stars out of five because it was raining)) During my visit to Ireland myself and some family took part in the ferry and it was an amazing experience. Our guide Jimmy was very friendly and told us some great stories as well as sharing some of the history of Dublin. Would highly recommend the Old Liffey Ferry to anyone This was a great tour. The guide was local as was his father and grandfather and as a result he had so many local stories to tell as well as a great knowledge of the local history. As a Dubliner, this was a lovely new perspective of the city. Very enjoyable experience! This was an hour well spent, a chance to see parts of Dublin from a very different viewpoint. Our guide was a great storyteller  and a font of knowledge. My only criticism is the lack of signage, making it hard to locate the boarding point. (It is located beside the Cill Airne ship and accessed by the same ramp.) Highly recommended. Brilliant tour today on the old Liffey Ferry learning all about Dublin Port and how it operates. We are all living in Dublin and found it very interesting; a side of Dublin we didnt know about before. Brilliant, authentic and personal tour guiding and an unexpected view of Dublin Port with excellent local knowledge! Id highly recommend this trip down the Liffey to Poolbeg Lighthouse and back, for both adults and kids! Thank you Frank Hopkins and our boat skipper! Frank and Dave were amazing company for this trip. Frank knowledge about Dublin and its history made this trip very special. Great atmosphere. It was realy enjoyable. My 2 little felas got to be vaptains as well ( thanks Dave). Appriciate it. Very enjoyable and informative journey. Excellent people with good humour operating the vessel. Would recommend this trip to all. Just had a most enjoyable hour on the Old Liffey Ferry. I highly recommend it. Our guide Jimmy was great fun, very informative, a master storeyteller. We did have a bit of trouble finding it so if youre going on the trip head for the MV Killarney, its right beside it We booked to go on the 2pm sailing and got there well before 1.45 meeting point we hung round and they sent a message to say it was cancelled at 2.15 ,after getting a taxi and it was our last day in Dublin  totally disappointed, no one was there just to inform us ...gutted Magic! What a way to see the city & Dublin Port - The Crew were great as well, great Dublin humor and craic and very knowledgeable about the whole area. I stumbled upon this as I was rambling along the river, they gave me so much advice I have to go back now to see it all!!! Oh! AND its ONLY  2 a go - for Charity! Took a ferry ride today with my family and it was fantastic. They even invited my grandson to drive the ferry. He was so excited. Thank you for an excellent tour. Had the best trip.  Jimmy was very informative and friendly.  So glad we did this trip.  I would suggest everyone take this tour.   Thank you Jimmy and David. Loved it. Great way to view the port and poolbeg chimneys. Excellent guides What a great trip down memory lane! I remember hearing people talking about the Liffey ferry when I was child. Great to see the service back up, running and giving the people of Dublin a great service. Brilliant ferry...so much information from Nyle...brilliant boat trip...recommend to anyone. Highly recommended,  fantastic trip with Frank, myself and my sis  really  enjoyed  the history thank you Great trip around the river and port. Lots of local knowledge worth the trip On the 15 March 2019 we went to get the ferry, the ferry wasnt operating, no signs explaining why this was the case, I rang the telephone number displayed, left a voice message which still hasnt been replied to as of today 31 March 2019. So I guess this service has ceased. This is great and a very handy way to see the liffey for only 2 euro <very short though >, brought my American cousins on it last week and loved it Great trip through the port and out to the lighthouse. Well worth it. Lovely relaxing trip and very accommodating staff Simple and easy.friendly crew and well informed cruise Great wether for taking pictures of the lovely old buildings Lovely experience for adults and kids. Amazing guys !                                       ). 15                     .               10.00      16.00.                  . Gutes Preis-Leistungsverhaltnis. Schone Bootsfahrt.

137,Old Town Cafe,4.875,"Visited the neighbouring conference centre for an event and happened to stumble across this absolute gem. Friendly staff and the food is exceptional. My only criticism would be a lack of sandwich variety for this few of us who not eat cheese. Would definitely recommend and revisit. Great food and service! Amazing cafe near the hotel at which we were staying. Clean also. Various sandwiches to choose from. Fantastic cafe. I was visiting the city for several days and came here straight off the plane. Ended up coming back on my last day since I needed a quick bite and knew the chicken caesar wrap was surprisingly good. Highly recommend! Lovely spot with great staff, food and coffee. Love the Mediterranean wrap and looking forward to other veggie options appearing on the menu. Beautifully tucked away Cafe! Cris, who grated us and was around for our staff was such a nice and helpful person! The sandwiches and treats sampled all went down well Reasonably priced, ability to book a table, good coffee (cloud picker beautifully made!) and a nice vibe! Many of us already promised to be back! Thanks for making us feel welcome and have a great time! The banana bread and the strawberry muffin were so good to eat and the coffee too. I took also the granola and yogurt which was only in the delivery/take away option (plastic cup still prepared with loots of granola and a tiny part of yogurt) while I would preferred to have a normal cup served at the table as I want (for example I don t like the marmelade on the bottom they put in the takeaway option and I would not have chosen it). Overall the place was really nice and the staff has been incredibly nice to us!!! Lovely little neighbourhood cafe. Quiet on Sunday morning. Really great baked goods. Had sausage roll which was tasty. Not heavily stuffed pastry but the taste was moist and could taste the seasoning and herbs. Had chai latte with oat milk (not on menu) but tasty! Dietary restrictions: milk alternative options available This is the best thing to happen in this area in the last few years. Fabulous cafe with beautiful options in the food and coffee menus. The staff are so friendly helpful and always have a chat. Always a pleasure to get my daily coffee in now plus the sneaky pastry treats :) Update a month later - what better a place to go on this stormy day for the most magnificent toasted sandwich and coffee. Thanks all in OTC for superb service and offerings Lovely, stylish interior. Extremely polite and friendly staff. Delicious coffee. Exceptionally tasty baked goods. This place is definitely raising the bar on the city center coffee scene. Great coffee, scrumptious treats and an amazing staff always ready to welcome you with a smile. Highly recommended! Tasty food, generous coffees. Lovely spot Best place to drink coffee in peace and quiet delicious food I popped in to this little coffee shop at the back of the rabison blue on Golden Lane and to say I was surprised is an understatement the staff were very welcoming and the food look delicious. I ordered a flat white and took the Italian sandwich which was focaccia bread chicken and pesto toasted nicely in an oven. The bread was truly to die for and when I asked the very charming manager about it I was informed that came from an artisan Argentinian bakery. My flat white was spot on unlike some of the other coffee shops in the area it was the perfect temperature and did not burn my mouth they also use Cloud picker coffee which had a great flavor to it I will definitely pop in here for lunch again soon. Best sandwiches  I have seen in a cafe, good coffee and friendly staff. Will be back next trip to city. Love the sweet delicacies!!! Old town Cafe in the city center exceeded my expectations in every aspect. From the exceptional coffee selection to the heavenly croissants, every detail was meticulously curated to create an unforgettable experience. If you find yourself in the city center, I highly recommend paying a visit to this hidden gem. Prepare to be transported to a world of delectable flavors and warm hospitality a true sanctuary for coffee and pastry enthusiasts. Ive been there at least 3 times, and it hasnt disappointed.  The coffee, croissants and cinnamon rolls are some of the best in Dublin, and all the staff is very friendly. If you are near to the Dublin Castle or Christ Church, this cafe is a very good choice. Food , place and servis top top top. We will definitely back soon , thank u Guys from an amazing experience. Food Beautiful little cafe in the centre of Dublin with a great outdoor seating . Wide range of pastries and cakes with delicious coffee. Food Great food and excellent service. Definitely coming back. Lovely staff, delicious food, great atmosphere. Highly recommend.

138,Ole Irlanda Tours,4.975,"A highly recommended company for a 12-hour excursion to Belfast from Dublin, very complete and enjoyable. The experience with Ole Irlanda Tours is amazing and you will learn a lot about the history and culture in Ireland. The guide tourist Agustina is very kind and always answer your questions, she knows a lot of about Ireland and she is outgoing and funny in your job :) Thank you! Excursion a Calzada del Gigante, Castillo de Dunluce y Belfast. A pesar de que los trayectos son largos, la excursion se hizo amena gracias a Anna, que dedico gran parte del tiempo en el bus explicando la politica, economia, historia y curiosidades de Irlanda e Irlanda del Norte. La visita al castillo esta bien porque tiene paisajes bonitos y completa el tour. La parada en la Calzada del Gigante duro el tiempo necesario para pasear y verla bien. En Belfast se necesitaria mas tiempo pero el tour es bastante completo aun asi. Dejan comer en el bus. Maravillosa excursion las que nos proporciono Ole tours, la guia Ana fue maravillosa nos enseno todo y nos conto con pasion de las persona a que aman su trabajo. El tiempo en el castillo y en la calzada fue suficiente, si le anadieran a Belfast media horita al menos seria magnifico.  Ana corrio y se esforzo porque todo fuese perfecto. Enhorabuena a ole tours y a Ana que no se puede ser mejor guia!! Gracias. Muy recomendable! Hicimos 3 excursiones y estamos encantados. Los guias son muy profesionales, tanto Sigfri en la ruta por la Calzada de los Gigantes, el castillo de Dunluce y Belfast. Mario en Galway y los acantilados de Moher y Antonio en Glendalough y Wicklow. Conocer parte de Irlanda con Ole Irlanda tours es maravilloso. Hicimos la excusrsion al castillo de Dunluce , Calzada del Gigante y Belfast con Sigfred y fue fantastico. Uno de los mejores guias que hemos tenido. Tiene un concimiento de Irlanda tremendo y una manera de contarlo excepcional. Un tour imprescindible si viajas a Irlanda, y si tienes la suerte de que te toca con Domingo como guia, ademas de preciosos paisajes disfrutaras de unas historias e historia de Irlanda muy enriquecedoras. Los tiempo muy bien gestionados para disfrutar de muchas cosas interesantes en el tiempo que dura. Supongo que si te toca con otros guias de Ole Irlanda sera igual de ameno el viaje pero yo solo puedo hablar de Domingo que fue quien nos toco. Una experiencia inolvidable, su guia, Domingo, nos enseno historia de una gran Isla como su gente. Un primer tour por la zona donde se rodo juego de  tronos, que a pesar de no haberla visto, nos inundo de pasion con sus grandes castillos, mansiones y rutas dentro de ese bosque encantado. Felicidades!!! Y gracias por ayudarnos en otras cuestiones. Y doble todo en las recomendaciones. La excursion a Belfast, Calzada del gigante y castillo con Ole Irlanda fue un acierto. Seba el guia, explico todo muy bien, con anecdotas y datos curiosos sobre los lugares a visitar asi como por donde pasabamos con el bus. Consejo para los siguientes excursionistas: llevar picnic, frutas y aperitivos. Sigi es un guia estupendo! Siempre atento del grupo y explico toda la historia con detalle durante todo el trayecto. El conductor es majisimo y en general OleIrlanda es un tour que merece la pena y con el que se disfruta de la experiencia. Repetire sin duda! Gracias!! Visite Galway, La abadia de Ennis y Los Acantilados de Moher. Lo pase genial y aprendi mucho en el recorrido. El guia Sigfri fue encantador y nos explico todo muy detalladamente. Repetire pronto!! Hicimos la excursion a Belfast con Ana y Peter. Nos gusto mucho. Merece la pena. Todo muy bien organizado y Ana hace que el viaje sea una delicia. Las vistas en la calzada del gigante impresionantes. Castillo de Dunluce, Calzada del Gigante y Belfast, excursion muy intensa porque son muchas horas pero pasa el tiempo volando, muy bien aprovechados los tiempos y viaje muy ameno. La guia Ana, espectacular con una motivacion por su trabajo insuperable asi como su conocimiento sobre la historia de Irlanda. 100% recomendable. Muy contentos con Sigfri! Fue nuestro guia en la excursion al castillo de Dunluce, la Calzada del Gigante y Belfast y se merece un 10 en toda regla Hoy realizamos una excursion a la calzada de los gigantes, Castillo de Dunluce y Belfast, con la guia Ana, ha sido espectacular, destacar la guia Ana, su simpatia y lo preparada que esta, te cuenta todo tipo de detalles durante el trayecto, lo que lo hace super ameno para las 12 horas que son, lo que parece la mitad de tiempo gracias a todo lo que te cuenta. Tambien destacar el chofer muy amable. La recomendamos 100% para empezar a conocer el pais. Gracias. Realice la excursion para los acantilados de Morhen. Increible. Ana es una excelente guia, nos hizo el camino tremendamente ameno, siempre super animada y dinamica. Transmitia muy buen rollo siempre. Ademas de super amable.y con mucha paciencia ya que algunos tardaban mas de la cuenta ...la verdad es que en eso si falla mucha gente.! Hicimos un tour al Castillo de Dunluce, la Calzada del Gigante y Belfast con Ana y es de los mejores que he hecho. Ana es una profesional excelente que te ensena de forma amena y divertida monton de cosas sobre Irlanda. Repetiria mil veces si Ana volviera a ser la guia. !Gracias Ana! Espectacular!! Mi pareja y yo hemos hecho hoy la excursion con el guia Sigfri , y de verdad que el marca la diferencia. Los lugares a los que vas son impresionantes, pero las explicaciones, los detalles que te va contando. Recomendable 100%!! Magnifica excursion por la Calzada del Gigante, Castillo de Dunluce y Belfast. La recomiendo 100% y mas si te toca un buen profesional como Sigfri. Mil gracias, Sigfri, por contarnos tantos detalles y preocuparte que en todo momento estuvieramos a gusto. Se nota la pasion por tu trabajo y como te gusta. Por cierto, muchas gracias por recomendarnos restaurantes un 10 a todos los que fuimos. Recomendaremos esta agencia, sin lugar a dudas, a nuestros amigos y familiares. Viajamos desde Espana a Dublin y contratamos un tour a Belfast y Castillo de Dunluce con ellos. Bryan el conductor espectacular, y que decir de la guia Ana, toda una profesional que ama su trabajo y cuida al detalle todo. (Ademas de lo correspondiente a nuestra excursion, nos hablo sobre historia, cultura, economia y curiosidades varias de Irlanda) Una excursion super interesante, y unos paisajes preciosos. Muy recomendable. Hemos hecho con Ole Irlanda Tours las excursiones a la Calzada del Gigante, los acantilados de Moher y Cork. Tanto los guias (Ainhoa y Domingo) como el planteamiento de las excursiones han sido de 10. Muy profesionales, atentos y agradables. Van mas alla de la historia del lugar y completan sus explicaciones con aspectos culturales, experiencias propias y recomendaciones. Los tiempos y las paradas estaban bien calculadas para disfrutar y aprovechar cada visita. !Muchas gracias por estos dias inolvidables! Ha sido uno de los mejores tours que he hecho en todos mis viajes, Sifri, es un guia top, por la estructura de la explicacion, un recorrido cronologico desde que salimos en el bus hasta las ultimas recomendaciones de cena, pubs o lugares tanto en Belfast como Dublin. Cada cosa que nos explicaba era interesante, riguroso con la historia, conectado con la cultura, con las leyendas, con las anecdotas. Los lugares son maravillosos, pero sin todo el contexto que Sifri le dio a cada lugar no hubiera sido ni parecida la experiencia. Gracias, !5 estrellas! Mi pareja y yo realizamos un tour a la calzada del gigante, el castillo de Dunluce y Belfast hace unos dias, la experiencia ha sido increible, no solo por los lugares que son espectaculares, si no tambien por la guia, Ana, quien ademas de dinamica nos ha ido explicando durante el viaje la historia de Irlanda de una manera super entretenida e instructiva. Sin duda cuando regresemos haremos otro tour con ellos. Dos excursiones con esta empresa, contratadas directamente a traves de su web, con un pequeno descuento. La excursion a la calzada del gigante y belfast con sifri de guia muy recomendable, guia de 10! El tour sufrio un pequeno retraso por una averia en el bus y se devolvio parte del dinero y ademas se hizo la excursion completa, aunque se llego un poquito mas tarde a Dublin. Excursion a moher con Ana de guia otro gran 10! Aqui todo genial, horarios, itinerario, etc Si vuelvo por irlanda, contratare las excursiones que me quedan con esta empresa. Una opcion genial para conocer diferentes tesoros de Irlanda desde Dublin. Excursiones en las que el tiempo se exprime y aprovecha por igual mientras se conoce mas a fondo la historia de cada sitio durante el trayecto en autobus a. Sigfri hizo que todo fuera de 10 y nos quedasemos con ganas de volver. Muuuy recomendable. Contratamos todas las excursionescon ole Irlanda tours, en una semana alternamos estancia en Dublin con las excursiones que  lleva esta misma compania.  Unas excursiones excelentes, superreconemdadas, en especial por los lugares que visitas, las explicaciones historicas , y la atencion de los guias, excelente , gracias Domingo y Ainhoa por vuestra paciencia y compartir vuestros conocimientos. Llegamos al pais un viernes y teniamos un plan propio para verlo, buscando en internet vimos el tour a Belfast, Dunluce castle y calzada de los gigantes. Lo cogimos in extremis para el dia siguiente. Es la mejor decision que pudimos tomar, Sigfrido (el guia) es muy amable, al igual que Bryan (el conductor). El guia sabe mucho acerca del pais y de los sitios que visitamos, lo cual permite preguntar cosas y aprender cositas interesante de la isla. Durante el trayecto explica la historia de la isla y el folklore tipico irlandes, lo cual te permite conocer muchisimo mas esta bonita tierra. En cuanto al tiempo disponible, si te organizas bien en Belfast te da tiempo a ver lo mas interesante de la ciudad. Como digo, muy buena eleccion, muy buena compania y muy buenos recuerdos que me llevo de este dia. La compania en si es Ole Irlanda Tours, la cual tiene diferentes itinerarios en la isla. !Disfrutad de este pais! Un saludo. PD: No hace falta pasaporte para acceder a Irlanda del Norte desde la Republica de Irlanda debido a un convenio entre ambas naciones. (Que yo estaba preocupado por ello) Espectacular! Recomendable si o si. Domingo es un hombre maravilloso que disfruta con su trabajo y se nota. Hemos sido 4 amigos haciendo el tour que te lleva al castillo de Dunluce, la Calzada del Gigante y Belfast y solo puedo decir que en un dia hemos hecho un master en historia irlandesa. Se nos ha quedado pendiente el de los acantilados, pero volveremos. Gracias Domingo, de motrilena de corazon a motrileno de pro. Fuimos desde Dublin a Belfast en el mismo dia. Todo fue de maravilla, tanto la logistica, como las explicaciones. Esruvimos el tiempo necesario para visitar casa lugar (castillo, acantilado y ciudad). El viaje en bus fue muy ameno, el guia nos contaba historias y narraba echos con gran sensatez, visto el conflicto que alli sucedio y sucede. Ademas, como el guia, Domingo, llevaba tantos anos viviendo en Irlanda nos contaba anecdotas de sus amigos irlandeses para entender mejor su cultura. Podria escribir mas pero lo mejor es que te apuntes y lo compruebes, de verdad que es una gran opcion. Nos encanto la excursion a Belfast, la calzada y el castillo Dunluce. Sigfrido el mejor guia y Liam el mejor conductor. Ambos detallistas. Todo fenomenal, cuando vuelva hare otro tour con ellos Las mejores excursiones las tuve con Ole Irlanda Tours. Guias amables, empaticos, pacientes, predispuestos. Solo puedo agradecerles, felicitarlos y recomendarlos ciento por ciento. Hoy hemos tenido una excursion a Irlanda del Norte. Salimos desde Dublin con un guia maravilloso, Domingo, y un chofer de 10, Connor. Una experiencia estupenda. Domingo explica las cosas super bien, se hace muy ameno. Hicimos el tour del Castillo de Dunluce, Calzada de los gigantes y Belfast. Todo super bien organizado, los tiempos perfectos y Ana, maravillosa! Tambien nombrar a Domi que los dias previos me ayudo dandome tips para el viaje y una comunicacion perfecta. Fantasticas excursiones en espanol si vas a Irlanda y quieres conocer el pais! Nosotros fuimos en Agosto y nos encanto! Autenticos profesionales con guias muy preparados y amenos. A nosotros nos toco Domingo y fue genial!!! Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo!! Una excursion preciosa, muy interesante, el guia, Domingo, una maravilla. Nos explico muchisimas cosas interesantes tanto de Irlanda como se la excursion. Comunicativo, simpatico y muy entendido en historia, mitos y leyendas. Nosotros hicimos el viaje a la Calzada y Belfast, quedamos encantados y con ganas de volver. Felicito a Domingo por hacer este viaje tan interesante, bien organizado, teniendo en cuenta cada detalle. Definitivamente volveremos y haremos tour con Ole. Gracias por todo.  Kevin&Roxana Recomiendo el tour al 100%. El guia super simpatico, amable y explica cosas muy interesantes durante todo el dia. Tuvimos la suerte de que nos hiciera un dia increible que nos hizo poder disfrutar aun mas todos los sitios impresionantes que gracias a este tour se pueden visitar. Repetiria sin duda. A highly recommended experience to learn a little more about the culture and history of this beautiful island. We went to Belfast, the Titanic museum and the Giants Causeway and we liked it a lot. From the attention we received when we called to inquire about the tour to the guide, Agustina, was excellent. Many thanks for everything! Hemos ido a la calzada del gigante el 30 de julio/22. Ana es encantadora y nos ha dado unas explicaciones estupendas que te situan perfectamente en este pais. Todo muy interesante y lleno de curiosidades. Sigue asi de entusiasta Ana y muchas gracias por todo. Estupendo el minibus para los que no quieran andar tanto (1,20 solo ida y 2,30 ida y vuelta) Muy recomendable!!! Fuimos a una excursion a Belfast incluyendo La Calzada del Gigante y el museo del Titanic. Le falto una paradita para pasear por la ciudad pero la verdad es que el tiempo no acompanaba... Por lo demas, todo estuvo muy bien y la guia, Agustina, nos explico todo perfectamente, y fue correcta, simpatica y agradable en todo momento."
139,Oscar Wilde House,4.225,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the interior of the house, its preservation, original furniture... Looking around the whole house seemed to bring me back to the life of O Wilde and his family. The house is toured independently, you can stay as long as you want. At the end, a film about Wildes life is shown and the film leaves a very deep impression. I recommend the tour! too disappointed, the old rooms are transformed into classrooms, the rooms are empty. The information we are given is minimal and not very interesting. Some rooms are very beautiful (like the library) and make up for the visit a little. I dont recommend it if you have little time in Dublin. Lovely place to visit, and get a bit of the story behind Oscar Wilde - specially about his parents, strong characters of Dublin life. The house is beautiful, and if you have the chance, don t miss the guided tour on Saturdays. But the self-guided tour is also great, super recommended. Sadly no current access, due to the students  exam times, but just being at this building of one of the greatest literary giants is humbling enough. What a tragic and beautiful story, passionately narrated by Martin! I really enjoyed the guided tour of the house where Oscar Wilde grew up and spent many years of his life. Some of the original belongings of the Wilde family are still in place (ie: a collection of books by Oscar and his parents, the Irish oak floorboards, neo-classical reliefs decorating the walls,and coloured windows). It is a different house visit compared to the norm - Oscar s family had to sell the house a long time ago, because despite the success Oscar s father ended up in misery (as well as Oscar himself). The building is now home of the American College Dublin, with the guided tours about Oscar s life being managed by a registered charity. The funds raised from the house visits are used to cover the house restauration expenses. I would definitely recommend the visit, the house is still a precious testimony of his life and also the director is so engaging in telling the family anecdotes besides having a wealth of knowledge on Oscar Wilde s incredible life. Really interesting tour, highly interesting to anyone who likes Wilde. There is not much to see at the house itself, but the tour was 100% worth it. Visited on This was the Wilde family home where Oscar Wilde lived from infancy before moving to England - 1855 to 1878. It is now occupied by the American College in Dublin. Unfortunately when I was there us was closed so I wasn t able to go inside but I still took pictures from the outside and then visited his memorial statue across the street in the park. No-one can get inside, it is a private college. You see the house only from outside. You can have a look at the beautiful park at the other side and visit the statue. Historic house where Oscar Wilde lived from 1855 to 1878 House in great shape, a must see for Wilde fans, and those who do not know him! A wonderful experience.  If you want to know more about Dublin History you must visit.  The Wilde family where a big part of it. A famous Writer with equity famous parents. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde I would absolutely reccomend this museum. It gives you a good sense of his heritage and his familys wealth without having to read an entire biography. The uses of each room are well documented so if you want to you can try and summon his ghost (I was unfortunately unsuccessful). Furthermore I also tremendously enjoyed the architectural aspects of the house which is just a small nice thing on top. However, if youve just heard of him its probably not worth the money though and youd be better off taking a picture with his statue just across the street in the park. It closed during the winter season.  You can see a monument of Oscar in the park just across the street. As an avid Oscar Wilde fan, I was hoping to see more than just the outside! Tours not available because American College apparently uses the space. Be sure to check out the memorial in the park, just across the street. Absolutely my favourite place in Dublin. Thank you so much to the girl where we bought the entrance tickets. Best regards Padua Italy What can i say, its Oscar Wildes house!! OMFG! And he has an action figure!! Visited on Famous place at Merrion Square, with Oscar Wilde monument just opposite in the park. Nicely kept and attractive place that was the center of intelectual and social life at the end of 19th century. A short film can be seen about the Wilde family, very interesting. Very nice and friendly gentleman selling tickets. I bought (again) a booklet of short stories. Heartily recommended during visit to Dublin. Brillant if you book the tour. The guide tells with passion and knowledge the story of the wild family and the house. Without the guide and from the outside theres not much too it. Unfortunately the house cannot be visited, there is an American educational institution in it, but from the outside one gets a feeling for the Victorian Dublin with a little imagination. Amazing experience, loved learning more about the Wilde family! Went to the tour recently and really enjoyed it. The guide was so good, really entertaining and an absolute mine of information on not just Oscar but the whole Wilde family. After the talk we had the opportunity to wander around the house which was terrific and gave a real tangible link to the lives that had been lived there. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone tourist or a local alike,so Interesting and entertaining like stepping back in time. As a museum, this is a big disappointment. Yes, Oscar Wilde lived here as a child but there is not much left to see from that time. In fact there is not much to see at all except bare rooms where the paint is peeling from the walls and ceiling. The museum doesnt tell you very much about Oscar either, all the more about his parents. The entrance fee is said to go to the house restoration fund, so in that way visiting the museum can be a charity. But the restoration supposedly started in the mid-90s and still it doesnt look like much has happened. If youre a hardcore fan of Oscar youll probably want to visit the house regardless, but otherwise there are better ways to get to know Oscar Wilde. If you really want to go, make sure to take a guided tour. Then you might get a little more out of the visit than I did. An interesting and historical place to visit, but there isnt much else than seeing the side of the building. The pictures are basically it. Only open for tours on Sundays at 2, but still cool to see! I went to visit this museum for the first time today (15-08-2022). Its a very interesting museum. This is where the famous Irish poet and playwright Oscar Wilde used to live as a kid. In the end of July 2022, I was going to visit the museum but unfortunately it was already closed for full guide tour. I knew it was very disappointing but its all forgotten now so theres nothing to worry about it. I was glad to visit this museum again. Anyway Id like to visit this museum again someday. If you have the same guide we had, you will have a fantastic experience. A journey through the life and times of the wonderful Oscar Wilde and his legacy to the world. no furniture in the bedrooms, but other than that very cosy visit! friendly and funny staff, has a short informative movie running and good merch! Despite my curiosity and interest in the life and works of Oscar Wilde, attending the conference on his life and family at this place that was previously his home was a frustrating experience for me. Listening for more than an hour to a speaker speaking in non-inclusive English.. that is to say quickly and without pauses.. understandable only to those who master the English language in this way has become heavy and tiring for me . What a pity :) If it had at least written support... or if at least the video had English subtitles... it would have been a little more open for foreign tourists who sometimes have difficulty following the accents + the speed of the speeches . I have participated in other tourism activities in Ireland and other English-speaking countries where the presenters understood that English is not the language spoken in every country every day. Even when we try. If we take the plane and pay for tickets to see another culture... its because we are curious. And it would be great to see that there are people who want to communicate with us too. We booked a visit on the last day of the Literature Festival, and even though my wife and I were exhausted after a transatlantic flight and a strenuous bicycle ride, we were not disappointed. Getting to know about the Wilde family history and stories in the house he grew up was fascinating. Highly recommended. We were able to visit this house but frankly for the price of 10 euros, there is not much to see. The decoration and furniture are quite pretty but the paper posters taped to the walls do not have a nice effect. Its a good deed to pay, thats all. Wonderful tour of Wildes childhood home, with a fascinating talk about his family, life, writing - and downfall. Captivating, loved the chance to walk through this beautiful house. The oscar wilde house is not about oscar wilde. It is about the house and family. This is in essence not a problem, but the information given is limited and is mostly about his brother. The information is not in depth, but only about the affairs the brother had and the mistakes he mad. The things they say about oscar are simple things like when he went to college and what he liked and did not like. Would not reccomend Thoroughly enjoyed the tour of Oscar Wildes house under the guidance of Martin Burns who is a well- informed natural raconteur. Highly recommended! Nice entrance from the outside, but you wont see much more as there are no visitors allowed. It is a small attraction, but the park across the street will greatly add to your experience. In the park is a statue of Oscar Wilde facing his home with pillars of granite in the area with many of his famous quotes. Directly next to him is also a small plaque at the base of a small tree planted in remembrance of all the LGBTQ+ persons of Ireland lost in the march towards equal rights which is quite touching. Afterwards I would recommended exploring the whole park and all its beauty. Cant go inside because it is a college. Total worth going to see the statue across the way 1. A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal. 2. A man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her. 3. Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much. 4. America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between. 5. Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination. 6. Arguments are to be avoided; they are always vulgar and often convincing. 7. Biography lends to death a new terror. 8. Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months. 9. I am not young enough to know everything. 10. I think that God in creating Man somewhat overestimated his ability. 11. I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and took out a comma. In the afternoon I put it back again. 12. Illusion is the first of all pleasures. 13. It is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so little useless information. 14. Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly uninteresting event. 15. One should always play fairly when one has the winning cards. 16. Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious. 17. Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live. 18. The only thing to do with good advice is pass it on. It is never any use to oneself. 19. The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. 20. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible. Oscar Wildes Statue (not house) I love the statue. It totally captures the subjects personality, in a way that would have probably amused the hell out of Oscar Wilde himself. Nice set up, beautifully framed by a bunch of trees... I didnt went inside but I have seen it from the outside and its beautiful Well, thats definitely a must visit for literature lovers ! So glad I could book the guided  tour before it was sold out"
140,Panem Cafe & Restaurant,4.6,"Cute small breakfast spot around the corner from the Morrison Dublin hotel. The hot chocolate was yummy. The pancakes and organic porridge were very filling (in a good way). Definitely got my moneys worth. Although it was filling I didnt leave feeling overfull. I think this may be a testament to the natural ingredients they use. It is a popular place. Many people stop in for their coffee and pastries. Lovely place by the side of Lifey River. Everything from food, coffee, cleanliness, and hospitality is just perfect. Coffee was really great. Focaccia was very good, like fluffy and light weight. Must try place. Definitely going here again and again. Lovely little cafe with great service and excellent food. We got the Spanish eggs and the avocado toast. Spanish eggs were amazing if you want a good, savory breakfast. My girlfriend loved the avocado toast. Great lattes to go along with it. Since it s small, there might be a little wait if you don t go early. We went around 9:30 on a Friday and had to wait a few minutes, but it was worth it. The pastries looked incredible, but we didn t try any. I m sure I ll regret that on the flight home. Great way to end our trip. We are spending our vacation for one week in Dublin and we found this place. The breakfast was OUTSTANDING! It was very delicious and made with a lot of love , everyone was very welcoming and kind. Great coffee too. When we left, we decided to take some of the bakery stuff as well for Take away and it was also very very good too. I recommend the croissant with Custard and apple, yummy! I am a big fan of their focaccias. We came back few times to try different fillings and they were all great. I even got a few for our flight home. It s a cute place for breakfast and lunch. They have plenty of tables inside and few outside. I wasn t a fan of their lattes but everything else was good. We stayed 4 min across the water from this place and fortunately tried it in our last day in Dublin. They have a great menu with mixes of breakfast options, sandwiches and salads. The staff are so kind, polite & the food is fantastic. Fresh orange juice, their own coffee blend, full Irish breakfast, pancakes, granola & fruit ~ perfection to start your day! The food tasted  healthy and fresh! Wish we knew about this a few days earlier! Amazing place, worthy the visit, and the food is delicious. Went for a brunch with my husband and we left very happy and satisfied. The baked goods here are delicious! Highly recommend the cinnamon roll and croissant. Small little cafe so can be difficult to find a seat if you come during the rush. We came about 30-60 minutes after opening and it was empty but another time that we came around 9am, we got one of the last tables. Amazingly fresh and delicious food, savoury and sweet choices on the same level of perfection! We have randomly chosen breakfast place during our trip and turned out one of the breakfast places ever Food was fantastic, the restaurant was very busy but we managed to get a table outside. Really great brunch! Very nice Cafe and pastry shop right on the river. You cant beat the location and the coffee is excellent. Get there earlier in the day to ensure you can choose from their wide array of pastries before they are gone! Hmm.  I wonder if I would have rated this place higher if I ate something unhealthy instead.  I ordered the vegetarian Irish breakfast, and it was good, but nothing spectacular.  I loved the restaurant location, and service was pleasant, but that is about it.  The croissants and bakery goods looked delicious, but I was trying to be healthy. Excellent breakfast. The traditional had a little of everything. The Spanish eggs were outstanding. Paired with freshly made focaccia and Italian coffee. Highly recommend. The pancakes were too sweet and could be better presented. The foccachia was good. The flat white was as it should be. This place is amazing! It is very busy during the weekend and especially in the mornings around 9.30-10. When we first came in there were no tables for us so the super friendly staff suggested us to take a 10 minutes walk and then come back. When we came back nobody moved so there were still no tables. However, since he remembered us he brought a table and two chairs from outside and squeezed us in:-) It was such a nice gesture! We had cappuccino, latte, cardamom bun, almond croissant and spinach focaccia. The coffee comes from Italy and tasted amazing! I loved all the pastries! Every bite of them was heavenly! I would be a regular if I lived in Dublin For a great breakfast with copious options including a revisited traditional Irish breakfast and its no more expensive than in the local pub. Just opposite the temple bar district, you can go there with your eyes closed to get some food! Great find. Service was extremely attentive. I cant emphasize enough how important that is to me. Coffee was great and reflected the Italian influence on that. Food was okish. Could be better if the focaccias were served fresh. Price is within the Dublin parameters. Unfortunately I have to give 1 stars! The waitress on the floor with dark hair she s managing/serving food with 5cm long nails and very long hair not tied up! I don t think this is so hygienic, while serving my latte she grabbed the glass from the top and not from the handle with these long nails    then the food, I got the special bakery brioche with custard cream, there was just a small tiny bit of custard on top and inside was empty - where was the filling? (Picture attached) 5 euro I paid for an empty panini essentially! Coffee also is nothing special, very bland flavour. Really good breakfast! Everything you need on your plate  . Staff very friendly! The coffee spot on Definitely a place to try! Food Fantastic coffee. 10/10. Perfect milk texture Came here with 3 friends on a Tuesday Morning, we had a full Irish, a vegetarian full Irish, the chorizo and egg dish, and a cinnamon roll, we all found out food so tasty and high quality, didn t take long either. I d specifically recommend the full Irish, the ham and sausage was such good quality, really nice spin on the traditional full Irish. Also all staff greeted us with smiles and our waitress was lovely and made sure we had everything we needed. Will visit again if I m around that part of Dublin and in need of brunch! If I could change one thing it would be the price of breakfast tea ( 3.50), a bit mad considering it s a tea bag and hot water, also when a lot of restaurants or cafes will include a tea or Americano in the price of a full Irish. Perfect for big eaters like me, the sandwiches or pizza are served generously. The staff is very welcoming. I had takeaway there twice for lunch, always just as good. The quality and quantity-price ratio is excellent. Good situated cafe directly at the Liffey. Cappuccino was good and the cinnamon roll delicious. However, all 4 pouched eggs were hard boiled which is very unfortunate for an otherwise pleasant stay. Next time it will be just the cinnamon roll with a hot beverage. Got the Belgian chocolate waffles. Super fluffy and the perfect amount of chocolatey A top Irish breakfast! Very well eaten. An address to remember Tested and approved 2 days in a row with different dishes and even a tailor-made one depending on your desire! To begin with amazing focaccia breads, we tried 2 different types and we were not disappointed but the staff is not that nice. We were waiting near the door (with a sign- Please, Wait To Be Seated) to be seated for a while and there was some staff standing near counter but like no nod, smile basically no validation because there were some seats empty but we thought maybe because its overwhelming so they did not notice us but then a white couple behind us and immediately one of the staff smiled and assured them a table which I did not like at all. Kind of made us wanna leave but we stayed because we heard a lot about the food which was not disappointing but the staff was extremely unpolite. Nice place, just in front of the river. Cosy inside, with this big window on the street, you consume ur meal/ beverages and ith natural light. they are attentive to details, maybe q bit less to the organisation, the waiters looked a bit confused. Coffee good and well presented, cakes good too. We had a great experience at Panem. The service was super friendly and attentive! The coffee is great (barista speaking  ) and the food  delicious. We ll come back! Popped in during lunch time. Really liked the vibe and the food. Had a cup of hot chocolate and filled focaccia and it was delicious and filling. Perfect for a quick lunch. The service was quite fast and prices were reasonable all factors considered The main difficulty is in deciding what to order. The vegetarian breakfast is full of flavour. The place has a nice buzz with a lovely view of the Liffey our breakfast was very tasty, will definitely be back We usually go to Anns Bakery but wasnt so impressed with our breakfast the day before so we thought wed try somewhere different, plus, I wanted porridge. A full English can be so heavy. Panem Cafe & Restaurant was perfect. A lovely view of Liffy, a gentle hum of folks eating and chattering, comfy cushions to sit on and my porridge was delicious. I am a difficult customer to please but they accommodated my needs no problem. Excellent, I will definitely go again. Cute lunch spot! Opted for a veggie Irish breakfast & coffee. Nice food and pretty view! When you are done you can get up and pay at the counter! Staff was friendly This is really one of the few coffee shops that I frequent in the city. Everything Ive ever had here was been amazing. They make all their croissants and pastries in-house, which is so rare here. Their croissants are butter and flakey, just how I love them! Ive enjoyed their caramel lattes as well. Recently, Ive tried their pancakes layered with custard. You really cant go wrong here. The location is also wonderful because whether you sit inside or outside, you have a quiet moment with your coffee as you watch the city buzz on beside you. Had a late breakfast here and it was a super pleasant experience. The freshly baked pastries were delicious and the coffee reminded me of coffee in Italy. The decor is a bit plain, but I guess it allows you to focus more on the taste of their great coffee. Really excellent vegetarian Irish breakfast! Super friendly and helpful staff. So glad we tried this cafe on our trip to Dublin. Would highly recommend the full breakfast, the Spanish eggs with chorizo and all of the filled focaccias. Great coffee and delicious Basque-style cheesecake too! This place is a regular treat for me. Very good address for filled pastries and focaccia! (The breakfasts looked nice too) Best croissant Great place for breakfast! Food is just delicious, the portions are good size, good coffee. It is definitely worth to go there Skip this place. Did something happen? I was excited to try Panem after reading the reviews, yet found the food, coffee and service lacking. Was really excited about having a delicious croissant and cappuccino for breakfast. The service was ok, not particularly friendly, but not rude. My plain croissant was not flaky. I seriously think it was from the day before. They had a sign bragging about the  best  almond croissants in town, so you would think their plain croissant would be good as well it s NOT! Very doughy inside and out. My husband had the chocolate croissant and he said it was  just ok.  Please do not call yourself a bakery if you do not make delicious croissants on premises. The pastries look good, yet taste very bland. The cappuccino was not warm enough and the americano was boiling. Maybe the barista was hungover? Our bill for two croissants and two drinks was 13 euro. NOT worth it. I ve had better croissants, drinks and service at Costa for much less. I will not recommend this place to anyone. I do not understand the rave reviews at all. Very disappointing experience."
141,Papal Cross,4.4,"Incredible view of a huge park. Nice for walks! Its like a large cross, but with history & meaning. Great parking and deer surrounding with walks and runs from here single and enjoyable A wonderful monument found at Phoenix Park. The park itself is amazing, but, this specific part of the park is a must visit place. With a large green field is welcoming for a walking. You may love the crows at early noon flying by these fields. Is really beautiful. Impressive view of the park from this high point and with luck you might spot a herd of deer. The cross of course, is a reminder of the papal visit and gods sacrifice for our salvation. I m so sad.. I walked there during 1 hour and saw nothing. I searched up in the reviews before coming and none said that there s chances to don t see the deer. I saw many pictures of many deer at this place but I presume that they are not here after 5pm and when it s a little bit raining. The bike rent was closing when we arrive and didn t tell us that it s because we can t see anything at this hour. Majestic big steel cross standing at 35 meters erected in 1979 for the visit of pope John Paul II. Lovely big place to spend nice Sunday afternoon with family. You can ride a bike, play football with kids, chill and have a lunch, walk your dog. Beautiful views  from the cross level. Highly recommend this place! Lovely day out with the family. Love the view on top , make sure to bring a picnic blanket for a lovely picnic day out after eating walk at the large greenfields at the back of the cross and you will see the wild deers . Perfect for a picnic The Papal Cross was erected in the Phoenix Park Dublin in 1979.  On the first day of his pastoral visit to Ireland, Pope John Paul II celebrated an open-air mass on 29 September 1979 to a congregation numbering over one million. The white Latin cross was erected just a fortnight before the Pope arrived, on the edge of the site known as Fifteen Acres. Pope Francis celebrated mass here on the final day of his 2018 visit to Ireland. Must visit if in dublin A historical landmark of Catholic Ireland. Great lookout if you re trying to spot the deer herds. Head their if you want to see all the deers Great location for all you can see all around Dublin from the top.  Deer are always close by as well as an ice cream van Great sculpture, very moving. The site of where two popes held mass! Its a large cross that reaches about 100 feet in the air on top of a small hill. There is free parking nearby. Impressive scuplture in the huge park of Dublin. It is a greenary area in  a huge park in which you will enjoy silence and the atmosphere. Great starting point for a walk or run Papal Cross The Steel Cross standing at 35 meters erected in 29th September 1979 for the visit of Pope John Paul II and he offered mass in this location, 38 years later Pope Francis also offered mass here on the 26th August 2018. Great place to visit with kids. A great monument of the Pope s visit An awesome stop on our 8 day ireland tour. Reply lovely for the sausage dog meet up today! A very good peace of history.its a shame that its not looked after Good spot for seeing deers. There is a free parking nearby. A big cross. With great panoramic views of Dublin. Herds of free roaming dears always close by this location. Superb place where 2 popes celebrated masses. Its worth the 25 min walk from Heuston Station Just a cross. Not so special. But there is a ice cream truck here and the view was beautiful there. Great outdoor time for a family and dogs The stonemasons are doing wonderful work on the crumbling wall of the American Ambassadors residence. Definitely worth a visit of one of the many attractions within Phoenix Park Its a historical landmark where two popes held mass. Thats it. Nothing to see here unless you come at dusk or dawn: There is a chance of seeing deer. Very beautiful, green, lush park. A lot of cherry blossom trees. Took about an hour to walk from one end to another. Sure its a grand place This cross made me think of home because at my home church we have a huge cross in front of the building. This cross was away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin and it really was just so peaceful and nice to see the cross up and close in person. I recommend going to the Phoenix Park if you are ever in the area. You may even run into a friendly runner there like we did. Beautiful view from this place in the park. Dont hesitate to walk around the area to see deer. Wonderful spot to take in the broad sweeping vista of the Dublin Mountains to the south:) Nice park to spend time on a sunny day Interesting place with a beautiful view over the park from the top of the cross hill. It was nice to watch them making the hay bales this evening"
142,Parliament House,4.275,"The House of Lords is closed and you can just view the historic building from outside. The building is a bank now. It s not open to public anymore. The Old Irish Parliment built on College Green Dublin in 1729 by Sir Edward Lovett Pearce and James Gandon. It lasted for 70 years. The British parliment abolished the Dublin in 1800 and incorporated Ireland into the United  Kingdom. Since early 1800s it is a bank. The house of commons is gone but House of Lords still remains and is open to the public  Monday to Friday, 10am to 12 noon. Admisdion is free Interesting Parliament house with no windows. You know why? Because window is a sign of wealth and theyve took them out to lower the price for this building. At first I thought this is the parliament of Republic of Ireland and I was wrong... Its now a part of Bank of Ireland and guess what the institution actually acquired it in 1803! Anyway, in case you wonder, the parliament in Irish is called Dail, and the place they meet is in Leinster House. Make no mistake. The name is deceiving : In the past - indeed Houses of Parliament, today - Bank of Ireland HQ. The complex is centrally located right near the entrance to Trinity College. Interesting architecture and history (no windows?!) . Great as a meeting/starting point for your tour of this area of Dublin. Very cool to see and right at the heart of the city. Conveniently located next to trinity college this site lights up at night and there are many statues out front. Great place to see and good night life. I just passed by the Parliament. THe building look very big and attractive. PERFECT INTERNATIONAL HOUSE SECURITY / THANK YOU TO LOIRE SECURITY PROTECTION Gorgeous building!  No longer used as parliament building but makes a fabulous bank building - very posh and grand!  Fantastic architecture.  Well worth seeing.  Just down from Molly Malone Statute, by Trinity College, St. Marks Church and many other great sites to visit. Favourite building in Dublin, without a doubt, the bank and government should work out a sale and make this the national parliament again for the first time since August 1800 Interesting piece of history. Walked past it and gazed at it inquisitively many times without knowing what it was until I looked it up on here. Shame it was restructured by the bank of Ireland under orders by the British government according to Wikipedia. Id recommend anyone with an interest to read about it. Not a fantastically interesting read but kind of cool all the same. Is sort of open to the public apparently but I have never been inside. Next time I pass by I will go inside if I am allowed and will update here. Every time I enter it I leave happy! Even a member of security went out of his way to help me, walked me to where I needed to go, got me seen to straight away and also offered me tea and biscuits he was a gentlemen!! I know, its Government Office, Bank but its a wonderful place to take a picture (urban, architecture, people) and the most important when you are meeting someone new in Dublin, they exactly know wheres Bank of Ireland. A wonderful place for meeting up with friends :-) and go for a beer later. Parliament House (Irish: Tithe na Parlaiminte) in Dublin, Ireland, was home to the Parliament of Ireland, and since 1803 has housed the Bank of Ireland. It was the worlds first purpose-built bicameral parliament house. It is located at College Green. Originally it was the site of Chichester House, which was built in the early 17th century by Sir Arthur Chichester. This building was adapted for use by the Irish Parliament in the 1670s, and was demolished to make way for a new parliamentary building. Chichester House was flanked by rows of narrow houses known as Dutch Billies, which were demolished and replaced during the Wide Streets Commission. Construction started in 1729. The building was home to the two Houses of Parliament, serving as the seat of both chambers (the Lords and Commons) of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland for most of the 18th century until that parliament was abolished by the Act of Union of 1800, when Ireland became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The current parliament building is Leinster House. Initially, the former Parliament House was used for a variety of purposes, including as a military garrison and as an art gallery. In 1803 the fledgling Bank of Ireland bought the building from the British Government for PS40,000 for use as its headquarters.[3] One proviso stipulated that it was to be modified so it could never again be used as a parliament. As a result, the chamber was broken up to form small offices and by a magnificent cash office. Architect Francis Johnston (then the most prominent architect working in Ireland) was employed to oversee the conversion. However, the House of Lords chamber survived almost unscathed. It was used as the banks board room until the 1970s when the bank moved its headquarters. The chamber is now open to the public and is used for various public functions, including music recitals. Some of the buildings contents survived. The ceremonial mace of the House of Commons remained in the family of the last Speaker of the House of Commons, John Foster, MP. The Bank of Ireland bought the Mace at a sale in Christies in London in 1937. The Chair of the Speaker of the House of Commons is now in the possession of the Royal Dublin Society, while a bench from the Commons is in the Royal Irish Academy. The original two tapestries remained in the House of Lords. The chandelier of the House of Commons now hangs in the Examination Hall of Trinity College, Dublin. The Woolsack, on which the Lord Chancellor of Ireland sat when chairing sessions of the House of Lords, is now back on display in the chamber. Copies of debates of the old Irish Parliament are now kept in Leinster House, keeping a direct link between the two eras. In January 1919, Irish republican MPs elected in the 1918 general election assembled to form the First Dail and issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. They chose the Round Room of the Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Dublin for their home. (The Round Room had more royal connections than the old Parliament House; it had been built for the visit of King George IV in 1821.) Free entrance and definitely a place to visit during the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising to see the historic former Irish Parliament building currently a bank. Its so nice in side if we had the Irish jewellery we need 2 find the Irish jewellery WE HAVE THE RIGHT 2 THEM BACK THEY WILL SHOW  UP There is construction going on, hence one of the two Houses visited on the tour is in a temporary location inside the museum. The tour guide was lovely. A piece of History! Went to Bank of Ireland located inside which seemed straight out of movies. Probably, the best interiors of all the bank branches. Why 5 stars? Visited comrades from Solidarity/Socialist Party. Best TDs! Cafeteria good, personell incl. guards friendly. Very nice. Great experience. Not sure if a visit should be high on someones list to see - particularly if you arent Irish. But fun. Free and open to the public. In the year of 1916 centenary celebrations be sure to check out the House of Lords Good land mark.But the Bicycle travelling is dangerous infront narrow turning road infront. Nice view for the architecture! First exhibition from new National Library of Ireland space - Seamus Heaney - is wonderful. This is the bank of Ireland. Not the houses of parliament. But a beautiful building. Its closed... A historical bank, thats lovely on the outside, and really nice on the inside me doyle obrian This is NOT the location of the Irish houses of parliment.   (The Oireachtas.) Its a Bank. Nice building. It is free to visit. Really nice looking place and where the prime minister is. Dont really like this place...its a bank without windows...! BOI at Camden st. doesnt open at 10am as stated on its door. Nice place Much respect for you being brave Good history but not very impressive Great building must see Tapestry in back room are amazing."
143,Parnell Monument,4.45,"The column is great and looks monumental, though its not actually all that huge. Great monument. South face of obelisk has gilt inscription: TO CHARLES STEWART PARNELL/NO MAN HAS A RIGHT TO FIX THE/BOUNDARY TO THE MARCH OF A NATION/NO MAN HAS A RIGHT/TO SAY TO HIS COUNTRY/THUS FAR SHALL THOU/GO AND NO FURTHER/WE HAVE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO FIX/THE NE-PLUS-ULTRA/TO THE PROGRESS OF/IRELANDS NATIONHOOD/AND WE NEVER SHALL and Go soirbhighidh Dia/Eire da clainn in Clo Gaelach This monument is to Charles Parnell, the Irish Nationalist, whose legacy eventually lead to independence for Ireland. The statue itself features Parnell standing, his right arm stretched out as if addressing a crowd, his left hand resting on a draped table. Behind him stands a 17 metre high obelisk with the words inscribed the words To Charles Stewart Parnell. No Man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation. No man has a right to say to his country. Thus far shalt thou go and no further. The statue has a QR code which you can use to hear a speech made by Parnell. Great monument. Another one of the monuments of O Connell street is the statue of Charles Stewart Parnell, revered nationalist political leader. You ll find his monument sitting at the top of O Connell Street, at the entrance to the square named in his honor. The monument features his famous words,  No man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation. To say to his country  thus far shall thou go and no further.   It is commonly joked in Dublin that the statue was constructed to point in the direction of the Rotunda Hospital, which was once Dublin s main maternity hospital, the humor being that Parnell was encouraging the Irish Nation to out-breed their enemies. Monument located at the top of OConnell Street and built in memory of one of Ireland greatest and most known politicians. Its at the top of OConnell, if you use the Aircoach service (Stop Gresham Hotel/OConnell Upper), or get on a bus tour, you might as well have a look. Quite nice to look at at night and the streets arent so busy then. Visited on This tall and beautiful monument (at the junction of Parnell and Oconnell) commemorates Charles Stewart Parnell, one of the most important political figures in 19thCent. Ireland. Impressive. One of the historical monuments, free visit. Beautiful! Watch for traffic!  The Parnell Monument contains different materials that make it exciting to view; not just stone. Definitely a must-see if visiting Dublin, and its on the main street with the airlink on so youd be hard pushed to miss it, really. Nice monument What a great monument. Charles Stewart Parnell, what a great chap. Kitty OShea, totally worth it. Popular spot for buying and selling drugs, also. Whether its green, white, rock or even just good old brown youre looking for, you can be sure of picking it up at the Parnell Monument. This is hands down the dopest monument Ive ever laid my face balls on! It symbolises everything and nothing together. I personally knew the man and I have to say its an exact replica; even to scale. He was a huge grey man, but he loved this country. This status stands in the very heqrt of the city and outstands in front of the parnell street. Ev3ry one will see this sculpture when goes to Dublin. Great Its a symbol Dublin City Centre it was very nice place and great monument Could be more carefully treated! Its full of pigeons droppings. Big stone thing, was hungry while visiting. No restaurants nearby :( Historical items that you found around Dublin and Ireland is full of facts to learn I recommend this place! Really good professional and I will be back soon Beautiful monument Inspiring although wet I thought it was a memory to keep....... The heavy traffic makes it difficult to bask in the moment. It s just ok A beautiful place In middle of the road. nothing too awesome. just a statue on a regular high traffic street Great to understand about the Ireland cities Lovely place to sit for a while Great statue to a great man Whatta amazing place! Great statue on the street Verry nice. I love it. A symbol of Dublin city center. History, lest we forget the struggle I mean... its there.. Awesome place Beautiful monument It is an obelisk not a place It Was beautiful nice statue"
144,Pat Liddy's Walking Tours,4.8,"Such a great walking tour of Dublin! It was the first thing I did when I got there. It really helped orient me to the city, and I learned so much about Irish history in the process! I have used Pat Liddy s Walking Tours for several years when visiting Dublin with my students. Every time we have the best guides! This week we had Fiona, who did an incredible job engaging students and telling stories that were profound and unforgettable, but still kept them quite interested. Whether a solo traveler, family, or group, I can t recommend Pat Liddy s crew enough - from booking to walking, they go above and beyond. (As a bonus, if you use them, you get 20% off at The Church restaurant which is a great Dublin experience as well!) I thought this would be a great way to see the sights in Dublin, because the reviews are overwhelmingly positive, but we didnt get to see much at all. Our tour guide was very nice, but she spent so much time talking and telling stories that we didnt have time to actually see anything. By the end of the 2.5 hours she was stopping on random street corners and pointing to where things were, rather than actually taking us to see them. We only saw 3-4 of the stops listed on the website. An overall very frustrating experience. Updating my response based on my note below: I appreciate your response, Pat. I dont mean to argue. But I do believe I have fair reason to be upset with our experience. Because we did not see half the things you mentioned. I knew what we were supposed to see. But we spent 90 minutes of the 2.5-hour tour inside Dublin Castle, and most of that time was spent standing in one place hearing various stories and histories. Which was not uninteresting -- it just wasnt what we signed up for. We only saw Christ Church from across the street, because we were running low on time. We then did walk through Temple Bar, but our tour guide only pointed to where River Liffey was -- we never saw it or crossed any bridge. So we did not see the OConnell Monument, the post office or anything on the North side of the city. And we never went past the Houses of Parliment or Trinity College. Our last stop on the tour was The Old Storehouse. After that, we were dropped back off at the Tree of Gold statue. I have no doubt these tours are typically great, based on all the positive reviews. And again, our tour guide was very nice. Had I not expected to see all the things you pointed out, I wouldnt have been as disappointed. But I expected to see a lot of things, and we skipped half that you listed. I hope in the future that our guide will be able to time things out better so that she can get to more of the stops promised on the website. We had a brilliant tour with Colm. Very knowledgeable and entertaining (songs, jokes, stories). Brilliant to hear the history, which is lesser known to us English, and not only see the major sights, but hear/see all the hidden stuff. Colm was brilliant, warm and friendly, and i loved the inclusion of a bit of sport. He even offered us up a couple reccomendations for the rest of our trip, which proved a hit. Highly recommended and hopefully you get Colm as your guide! Just Wow!  Incredibly interesting and well informed local guide Eoin brought the history of Dublin alive.  We thoroughly and unreservedly recommend this tour to anyone wanting an introduction to Dublin.  Tremendous value for money and great fun into the bargain.  What more could you ask Wonderful, wonderful experience! A perfect way to see and learn about the city. Our tour guide, Eoin, was nothing short of great. His knowledge, joy, and humor were infectious. We left the tour in love with Dublin,  highly recommend! Enjoyed an utterly splendid Walking Tour of North Inner City, Dublin on 31 January 2020. Blessed with glorious sunshine, the erudite Pat Liddy brought us on a great tour around this fascinating area,  recounting the history of the area, its regeneration (in parts), anecdotes. We were a group of 13 and we spent an exceptional, interesting, hugely informative two hours. Truly, walking about is the best way to appreciate any city. One would do this abroad, lovely to explore our own beautiful capital. Pat is a great author, with books to his name; he has been a newspaper columnist & is a talented artist too. In addition, a real gentleman. He does a wonderful range of Walks & has a fine website. Thank you, Pat. I loved our day out. Liam was an amazing tour guide!!  He was so knowledgeable about the architecture, history, and food eateries around Dublin. Would recommend for anyone visiting Dublin for the first time!! Our guide was as knowledgeable as she was affable. Dublin has more history than you can pack into two hours but she made a valiant attempt. I would wholeheartedly recommend this tour service to anyone seeing the city for the first time. My students were tired, they had just walked 20 km. I told them they could abandon the visit after a while if they couldnt take it anymore. None left, as they were so captivated by our super guide, Sam Ford. Very informative and funny visit at the same time, clear and perfect diction, even for LM3s. I highly recommend to all teachers! My partner and I had the most wonderful tour from Pauline. She held everyones interest and managed to get plenty of laughs out of us all too. An informative and entertaining walk through Dublins history with Eoin - he knows his history and brings it alive.  Highly recommended as a great starting point to see one of the great cities of Europe. Thoroughly enjoyable tour. Im sure we only scratched the surface of the history of this amazing city. Ronan our guide was extremely knowledgeable and a top bloke. Rating would have been much higher except for the fact the tour guide spoke so softly we could not hear half of his info. We got the walking tour free with our green hop on hop off tickets so it was ok for free. Would have been upset to pay for a tour I could not hear Our tour guide Ronan was brilliant! Very knowledgeable and witty. Would highly recommend this walking tour, it s good value for money and very interesting Very entertaining and interesting walk through some of Dublins history, with guide Eoin. Eoin did wonderfully as our guide. The tour was fun and engaging. Brilliant tour of Dublin. Would thoroughly recommend it. Clients enjoyed and spoke highly of guide Fantastic tour recommend  to all not to be missed . We had a group tour with 13 people. We had a lot of fun on the city tour and Fiona was a wonderful guide. Wir haben die Tour Dublin Highlights and hidden corners gemacht und es war wirklich schon. Man klappert nicht die typischen Touri Spots ab sondern sieht wirklich mal etwas Neues. Unsere Stadtfuhrerin Fran (wurde in Dublin geboren) war sehr nett und hat einem alle Fragen beantwortet. Wir hatten am 13. August 2021 die deutschsprachige Fuhrung mit Sam. Es war einfach wunderbar. Leuke wandeling en informatie! Goede gids die Ouen. (SEAN) nan nan nan If you want a proper guided tour with someone who doesnt shout and carry on but has plenty of craic and knows his subject inside out then go on a Pat Liddy Walking Tour. The man is an absolute gent and is a veritable legend at this stage. What he doesnt know about Dublin is not worth knowing. Highly recommended - and then some. Brilliant tours. Remembered many years after. Highly recommended every time someone asks me what to do in Dublin nan"
145,Pearse Lyons Whiskey Distillery,4.825,"Explore one of the best distilleries Ireland in Dublins liberty district. Inside an accurately restored church where you can sample Irish whiskey made the old way. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The tour was very insightful. Cannot recommend this whiskey distillery enough. Its based in a formerly working church, which is incredible. I bought my ticket ahead of time to guarantee a spot. You can choose a few types, which basically means how many whiskeys you would like to try. I did 5 and it was a good amount. One of them was actually a gin. The tour was very informative and at the end is a very nice gift shop. Decent prices for whiskey I think. Friendly staff. Very nice tour of the distillery with an amazing and varied selection of tastings. I particularly enjoyed the more history focused aspect of the tour. Had an amazing time. Edit: also did the gin class today and it was amazing. It was both interesting and fun. Plus the guide was very informative and it was overall a great experience as well. A unique experience of a distillery tour, but within a repurposed church. I booked onto this last minute after finding it a stones throw away from the Guinness Storehouse and Im glad I did! John our tour guide was knowledgeable, passionate and humourous, taking us on the journey of the church that now is a distillery. I loved hearing about the past (which appeased the history buff in me), present and future on a fast pace yet relaxed tour, that culminated with drinking whiskey (and gin) where the pews would have been in the church. I booked the legacy tour, which was cracking and gave an insight into to most of their offer. The attention to detail in the design within the church is a testament to the love, sweat and tears that has gone into this exciting concept. Definitely worthwhile! BEST DISTILLERY!!!!!!!! We visited several beer breweries and whiskey distilleries and this was BY FAR the best. I would highly recommend this tour above any other. Other places such as Guinness can handle a lot of people but this one was the most informative and best experience! We booked a tour online had no wait time. Our tour guide JOHN was phenomenal. Very professional, personable and friendly. John is very knowledgeable and provided a riveting tour on the history of the land, church, and whiskey. Although I had been to other tours and museums I did not fully understand the process behind distilling. John explained it in such a way that it clicked for me and it was just a valuable tour. I absolutely loved the added history of the location of the graveyard. He even added historical context of other distilleries, monuments and historical figures. The church in which the distillery is absolutely breathtaking. Also the whiskey was very good. I throughly enjoyed the tasting and discussing the flavors and experiences elicited. We also added drops of water to the whiskey which was so fun to experiment with. 10 out of 10 would recommend the tour with John. It was certainly one of the most enjoyable moments in Dublin. I now feel so much more educated in whiskey, gin and the Pearse company. I look forward to experiencing more of Pearse whiskey. Thanks John! We really enjoyed the distillery tour!! Having done a few gin distillery tours in Ireland, this was my first whiskey one, and it was excellent. Hubert, the host, was outstanding and very knowledgeable. Learnt a lot about Irish whiskey. The tastings were fantastic as well. This is a beautifully restored old abandoned church.  The Pearse did a great job restoring the church and converting it to a family owned distillery.   It now has a visitors center and a tasting tour of its whiskey and gin.  The tour was good with a historic explanation of the important ties of the St James Church to the Pearse family. Great experience at the Pearse Lyons Distillery! Was lucky enough to score a private tour with Bernard and tasting with Sebastian. The tour was a great blend of history as well as interesting insight into the whiskey making process along side generous tastings - highly recommend. Great little distillery. Quite small and quirky tour guide is very knowledgeable and always happy to answer any questions. Would recommend Visited on The tour was very interesting! So much history and details to enjoy. The church has been beautifully reimagined into a gorgeous distillery. Both my wife and I enjoyed our time on the tour and the tasting. The staff was wonderful! We were treated with respect and our questions were answered. The Pearse Lyons tour comes with some really unique history about not just Irish whiskey, but the church location of the distillery. Highly recommend for a distillery tour in Dublin. Best Whiskey distillery tour weve experienced so far! Our tour guide John told us the amazing history of both the founder and also the beautiful and lovingly restored church. He also expertly guided us through the whiskey tasting. A must-see stop in Dublin. Highly recommended! Visited on An amazing distillery in the heart of the liberties! Such a beautiful place, the renovated church is! Definitely recommend going instead of the more touristy tours (Guinness, Jameson, etc.) Went to Dublin in March, 2024 (my first time to Ireland), and on my first day the bartender at John Fallons Capstan Bar recommended this distillery for the whiskey (of course), and its location. I booked the tour and walked from my hotel to distillery, and it was really amazing walking up and seeing the old church. I ended up being the only person on the tour (aside from one man who was training that day), and it was such a lovely and education private tour. I forgot the initial guides name, but he explained so much of the history and we talked a while about the graveyard and the numbers of people buried there. I was fascinated! After entering the church, it was incredible seeing the amount of work they had done not only making it into a distillery, but maintaining the beauty of the cathedrals personality and history. I had the legacy tasting, and the young woman conducting the tasting was delightful. The whiskey was quite good, and if I could have afforded the Genesis bottle I would have definitely purchased one! Thank you for a wonderful experience! I brought a sample pack to enjoy after my trip. Came here with a mate as we both have an interest in history and good whiskey. Have to say the overall package was quite good, we weren t waiting no more than 5 minutes after going in to the reception. We got to watch a short film detailing the companies history, explained in part by Dr. Pearse Lyon s RIP. Then we got a tour of the grounds and then a tour of the main church itself where the distillery facilities were based. We got to try a number of whiskeys between 4-12 years old, a Hapenny Gin at the end which was unexpected, and the new Pearse Lyon s Genesis whiskey which has a very unique packaging designed after the glass spire that replaced the original destroyed church spire. Overall I d recommend the tour that I went on, the tour guide John was great at informing the group and making the history interesting and understandable. He was also great for answering different interesting questions that people had. There are of course other tours and experiences that I wasn t on that seem quite interesting too, I would think they are also very good as well. Amazing experience. John, the guide, gave us a great tour full of rich history and great knowledge of their products. The 12yo whiskey is absolutely great!! Unfortunately their shop is out of my budget, but will definitively save and treat myself with a nice 12yo and a candle (loved the green one). Thanks!! Visited on Fantastic tasting and history lesson at the Pearse Lyons distillery!  Parking is a nightmare...but if you are there on Sunday parking is free everywhere downtown.  Loved their 15 year!  Give yourself a treat and taste some whisky! One of the smaller distilleries in Dublin/The Liberties. The tour felt more intimate, you got an extra sample before the tour began, and it s in such a unique building a church. It s absolutely stunning on the inside, if you have more time try to book the cocktail making classes, they seem like a lot of fun! I recommend doing the tour.... Get the full experience. We were there to find an old relatives grave but out of the 100 000 buried there there is just a fraction of the stones still readable. We went for the 5 whiskey/gin taste and it was amazing. Knowledgeable staff about their products and also being locals, give us great advice for our next stops. Felt amazing afterwards and wandered off smiling and enjoying the beautiful sunny day! Perfect Glad we chose this distillery to take a tour of. If you have to choose between this or the Guinness brewery to take a tour of, choose this one. It is a newer distillery but what they have done with the cathedral is impressive. They were able to blend modern and ancient into one experience. The whiskey is pretty good though quite young (since the distillery is new). The Gin and Rhubarb Gin were both tasty as well. Absolutely loved this tour! Lots of history of the church and very neat to see how they renovated it to make it into a distillery. Also loved the story of Pearse Lyons himself. Definitely recommend just for the experience of being in the church and seeing the glass spire, whats even better the whiskey and gin! Loved the experience, if were ever in Ireland again...we will be back! The place is beautiful and peculiar but I found the tour only ok. We got really too many information at a fast pace and during the tasting we didn t have the time to finish one whiskey that they were already presenting the next one. One of the best tours Ive done. Interesting family history and the restoration of the building is super impressive. Well worth a visit. The Pearse Lyons Distillery in Dublin offers a wonderful tour that allows visitors to learn about the history and production of Irish whiskey. The guided tour provides a fascinating insight into the traditional methods of whiskey-making, and visitors can also sample different types of whiskey and enjoy the beautiful surroundings of the restored church. We went with three persons to Pearse Lyons Whiskey Distillery on a Thursday. Because we went already to so many Distilleries we didn t do the tour but still tried the Whiskey. The tasting was very good and the shop has also a few very nice items with very good quality. The extravagant interior of the church combined with the distillery is an amazing combination. The special thing about this Whiskey distillery is the story of Irish entrepreneur Thomas Pearse Lyons and the special location; in a church that Mr. and Mrs. Lyons restored for 25 million euros. Extraordinarily beautifully done, I can enjoy it when people create something with care. Needless to say, we also had a tasting of a few whiskeys. I don t like whiskey but here id started to like it a little bit more. The place its magic, and the tour it really educational, immersive and well organized. You can try whiskey and gin    really smooth both. The renovation of the church and all the history, differentials from other options. Thank you for a great experience! Overall, this was an interesting experience. We booked the basic tasting and the tour is the same as the other tastings, you just get a different coulored wristband to show how many tastings you  will be served. The introduction movie and guide both talked in length, but still intetestingly, about the history of that place. What I missed a little was more information and demonstration about the distilling process, I would have loved to feel and taste all the different stages. If you book the last tour of the day be aware that there is not that much time for a lengthy tasting procces, that part covers about 10-15 minutes. I would recommend this event, the guide was friendly and it was a good experience for whiskey-newbies. This was an excellent whiskey tour, the whiskey tasting during the very start of the tour watching the video was a nice touch. Then the old church setting is incredibly unique.  Accessible to all and reasonably priced. This place is underrated. What an amazing visit. The team there are phenomenal. I travelled to Dublin for the day and the tour was so personal. The guys were so knowledgeable as well. It felt as if I worked there because the environment was just perfect. The whiskey is WAAAY underrated! The best whiskey I ve ever tasted. The flavours were phenomenal. Doing this tour should be mandatory and it should be done injunction with the Guinness Storehouse tour. Defo worth the money! Please people!! Go Go Go. This was 100% the best part of my trip! Very nice distillery. Nice and friendly staff. The building is a renovated church which make it very unique. Its a shame old Pearse isnt alive anymore. Interesting tour with some nice whisky to taste. Id you are in Dublin then its definitely worth a visit. Pearse Lyons Whiskey Distillery is a great tour, especially when you are already in Dublin 8. You will get to try 3 types of their own whiskey and 1 type of their own gin with the basic tour package. We had Paul as our tour guide and he was excellent. Highly recommend. We loved the tour and tasting. The welcome center is clean and modern. The second floor overlooks the cemetery and church which is a really cool view. The tour includes a lot of history about the church and the graveyard surrounding it. We thought it was really cool to include the history of the site with the tour.  Inside the church is gorgeous. Even if you don t do the tour, it s worth seeing. The whiskey was delicious and the gin is quite good. We loved our experience. Perfect tour! It was a comprehensive learning experience not only about whiskey but also the city. I liked their whiskey even though I m not a huge fan of whiskey!:) One of the best Distilleries in Dublin. Pearse Lyons has great Whiskey and even a decent gin. They offer a few tasting tours, while all of them are the same, the difference is the amount of pours you get. 3, 4, or 5. Each comes with a starter pour while the video at the start plays so thats an extra for all of them. The Gin is included on every tasting and while good, wasnt the best. ( Even on the tour the guide gave us all club soda with it) The Whiskeys are very clean and easy to drink, partially owed to Irish Whiskey being lower proof on average than America Whiskey. The guides were fabulous and the entire staff crew were genuine and kind. The cemetery out back is interesting and a sight to see, but the star of the show is the church. The church is worth the tour alone, even if you dont drink. Dont miss it. The Whiskey bottles are very expensive but its craft Whiskey in Dublin so its worth grabbing a bottle. I recommend it overall. We did the Gin School experience and had a really great time. Right at the start we were greeted with a gin & tonic. We were then shown to the work stations and were able to choose the flavouring for our gin. The guys who were working there were very knowledgeable and told us a lot about the history of gin and its origin. They provided us with 3 gin and tonics during the experience and at some point they also brought in a cheese and charcuterie board. Overall it was an amazing experience and well worth its money. I can really recommend it. Part of the big bus tours. For me and my brother one of the best parts of our tour. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience - the building, history and distillery. Regret not choosing the extra drink option! Amazing place Worth every euro I spent. The staff really took the time to explain the history of the church, cemetery and distillery. Everything was done professionally and courteously. Everything was not rushed eventhough we were there for the last tour on New Years eve. I really appreciate the staffs that made this trip a memorable one for me and my fiance. All the whiskeys were amazing. Not forgetting the gin as well. I am definitely getting a few more bottles before heading home. The church was very ornate and nicely done to home to distillery and the stain glasses each had their own story. I highly commend on the staffs uniforms. It makes everyone look professional and neat. Elevates the experience to something very luxurious. I enjoyed my visit here more than another distillery nearby. Great tour. Fantastic guide. Thank you soooo much for looking after our booking Lidia:). The tour was quite interesting, its a shame that the guide didnt put a little more effort into pronunciation, with an average level of English it can be hard to follow. The whiskey was rather very good considering that it is not very old, quite surprised there. The problem is felt from the tasting, we are pushed towards the exit door quite quickly, because of that many people were unable to finish their glasses and even after that, unable to stay in the shop while Another group arrives, so from the moment you taste the first whisky, you have 20-30 minutes max to finish your drinks, and make your purchases in the shop The shop and the bar are not accessible without a visit."
146,Pegeen's Cafe,4.5,"Pegeens cafe is part of the Abbey theatres pre show hospitality, set up in the foyer. Lovely food and beverage options. Offers an ambient space for reflection, while checking out the latest performances on the Abbey and Peacock stages. Delightful cafe based in the theatre but with sheltered outside seating. Coffee teas and cakes. Friendly staff. Lovely interior and coffee, friendly staff and great to be able to sit in the National Theatre for a chin wag Coffee and brownie were deeeelish and staff were lovely. Even the furniture had a story to tell. First time in Pegeen s Cafe and I will be back! Wonderful staff and coffee is great. Cappuccino excellent nan nan"
147,Petit Cafe,4.525,"Nice little cafe right opposite the Museum of Archeology. One of the best hot chocolates we ve had, and the soft and warm croissants were a nice break from the cold and rainy day. We went during busy hours and the staff was very efficient. The lady running the register (the owner?) was so kind and helpful. The food was delicious and came out quickly even though it was lunch rush Great local coffee shop, personal touch, lots of people dropping in and out, food was delicious. Staff very friendly. The Mocha was very smooth and not extremely sweet! I would definitely go back!! Also, they have Almond milk!! I went out of museum, really hungry. I saw this nice cafe, and choose soup of day. warm lentil cous cous soup. Taste was precious, light spicy and warm. My girlfriend ordered a panini stuffed with veggies (arrugula tomatoes and a pesto basil sauce). Taste was good too. I took some time to read all what was on the blackboard and the choice is yours..there are a lot of interesting dishes..i saw a big bowl with (I suppose) cold noodles salad and it was really yummy. Service was really quick and place is nice, I enjoyed to spend a relaxing half hour there before rush again trough the town. Girls working there was nice to me and cared about all my questions about food despite there were other after me, waiting to order. Recommended. Small cafe opposite the National History Museum. Tea and coffee for decent prices. Convenient place for a quick lunch. Good selection of food with great vegetarian options. Great sandwiches! Wonderful customer service. A cute little place that my sister and I found and really enjoyed. Definitely check it out! Efficient yet decent service. If youre in Kildare Street or nearby, this is a nice independent cafe that I recommend. Best thing though is probably not to go during lunch hours as thats when its most busy but even then the service is pretty quick which is handy if youre in a hurry somewhere. A while ago when I was vulnerable and going through a lot of things, one day I decided to go to this cafe rather than the big chains, so that I could support the small local business. I was running out of battery on my device and I plugged it into the socket on the wall. The arrogant, unpleasant owner made a big deal about it and complained that I didn t ask her for her permission before plugging in the device. I left and I never looked back. If you want to run business and compete with larger competitors, having a good attitude towards your customers is the bare minimum. We came out of the National Museum, starving, and saw Petit Cafe across the road. My first thought was, Centre of town, across from the Dail? Itll be expensive. Sometimes it can be nice to be proven wrong. Here the prices were good and the food was excellent. The service was very quick and friendly. The next time I am looking for a bite to eat south of the Liffey I will make it a point to go back to Petit Cafe. Really? ........ How can you not be ashamed to give something like this to people and expect them to pay over 6 euro for it. It looks like it fall on the floor and u picked it up and gave it to me. Excellent coffee, great sandwiches, friendly service what more do you want? Pleasant coffee which revitalized me while I was sleeping there. Pleasant owner! It is a petit cafe, small with limited seating so dont turn up in a crowd. Lovely breakfast and lunch options to be had. Friendly staff. Eggs are always excellent. Great sandwich of the day and hot pots. Le Petit Cafe is truly a delightful escape from the hustle and bustle of busy Dublin life. The menu is littered with tasty treats and always leaves you longing for that next sweet hit of lunchtime goodness. Needless to say, Im always left satisfied and smiling after a trip to Le Petit Cafe! But Tom? I hear you ask, why only give this wonderful establishment a four star review? Well my fellow google reviewers, I suffer from a rare form of claustrophobia, which can render me completely incontinent. Le Petit is but a small brasserie and the confined interior can sometimes cause me severe discomfort. However, so long as I have kind compassionate colleagues to venture into Le Petit, I will continue to be left satisfied and smiling by my daily Le Petit fix. As someone who has eaten ALOT of sandwiches from many places i can confess eating this sandwich was a heavenly experience, definitely the nicest sandwich i have eaten and the customer service was beyond great, there is not a word to explain how great my experience was, if Im ever back around this place, to here i will most likely end up. Contrary to a previous review, coffee is not  4.80. An Americano is  2.50 and a cappuccino is  3.00. Cheaper and tastier than any chain cafe. Hands down the best gluten free sandwiches!!    Sooo delicious and the staff are so lovely  too Nice food, nice people, and quick servive, perfect for a quick breack between museum Great little cafe with great food, coffee, and an excellent staff. Overpriced food. Unpleasant owner. Instead of complaining about people on pup. Pay a decent living wage. At  4.80 for a coffee, Im sure you can. Got a very good coffee in here a few weeks ago. One of the smallest coffee shops I ve ever been in & friendly lady serving too. Cute little independent cafe run by friendly Brazilians. A killer sandwich and coffee = a very pleasant start to my trip to Dublin. Reminds me of a very discreet cafe I know hidden in Brussels, Belgium...charming place across from Irish parliament Quiet cafe with good vegetable soup. Wide choice of sandwiches and panini. Very friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. Not too much space for sitting. Small Cafe next to the Irish museum. Coffee is pretty good :) cute & quaint little place. delicious hot chocolate! Best Cafe, lovely staff. And, the tastiest scones in the world. Thanks, Carol! Possibly my favorite cafe in Dublin. The owner is usually working and she is lovely. Porridge is a must. Very large coffee for the price! And tasty as well! Nice coffee and lovely team working here early in the morning! Thank you Lovely little cafe, very nice service and the coffee tastes great Friendly staff with a breakfast menu far better than any cafe in the area. delicious hot chocolate, coffee, and croissants :) Nice coffee and croissant in small and cosy cafe, and very friendly service. Best porridge I ve had in Ireland. Great customer service. Great location and the scones were perfect. The staff are friendly and the coffee is amazing Love the vibe and they do a great coffee."
148,Phoenix Park,4.875,"I went to Phoenix Park on a sunny day, and everything was beautiful! The park is huge, with plenty of space for walking and running. Lots of families with children and people of all ages. The deer are one of the main attractions; they are used to people, so you can get really close. I also loved the organic garden; I wish I had one like that in my backyard, haha. Largest park in a European city that is great for playing, enjoying, walking, biking and spotting deer and various birds. It also have a a zoo, the Presidents house, papal cross, flower garden and other things as well. Strongly recommend. I loved the park and felt it was very well designed as there is a clear straight road the cars could take making it easier to go to each part of the park. There is also a public bus that goes through the park in case you dont have a car. You can also easily play games in the park grounds. Nice place to have a walk and enjoy the nature. There are several tracks to walk so you can choose which routes you want to take. As the park is huge, it doesn t get crowded. Along the way there are some benches to sit and relax under the sun. I was lucky to see some deers resting and eating around the park. Definitely will go back when in Dublin. Very very large park! We had come to find the deer. We wandered in vain for more than an hour when suddenly when we decided to leave we came across them     very beautiful park in any case especially at this time of year! Beautiful So peaceful and yet full of life at the same time. Families, runners, and people walking their dogs. Parking at certain spots. Lots to do and see, quite a big park. This is a fantastic amenity. A wonderful green space within the city of Dublin.A meditation haven.Sports a fine herd of deer,so I am told..but no luck for me. It has many pathways  both hard and soft underfoot. Perfect for indulging in outdoor activities ,e.g walking,jogging etc,.It houses Dublin  Zoo, The American Ambassadors residence,sports areas,children play area, among others. Has monuments,sculptures and the  Papal Cross. Well worth a visit in any season. Incredible and huge Phoenix Park, located in Ireland. We were here last year in the summer.  This is a must visit place. But I warn you right away, you need to walk a lot here). You can also rent bicycles at the gate. As soon as you enter the park, you see many different trees, shrubs and flowers.  Somewhere in the middle of the park there are already large green meadows where you can relax and enjoy the views of various historical monuments. There is a zoo, a cricket club and various cafes. The park is very large, so it will take more than one day to explore everything. My friends and I purposefully walked to a clearing with deer, many said that we might be unlucky and there wouldn t be any, we wandered for a very long time and finally found it. It was simply an unforgettable and fabulous moment. We saw a herd of deer roaming freely. We were able to pet them and feed them. It was the most amazing walk through probably the largest park in Europe. Highly recommend visiting for a breezy walk, to have deep conversations, or just lay back looking at the sky and bird watching. I m positive there used to be more trees, sad that they re minimal atleast where we walked. Beautiful public park with great hiking and biking trails. It can feel like you re in a rural forest even though you re still in the middle of Dublin. A huge park in Dublin. Stunning place full of green. Whats more, if youre lucky you can see a herd of deer which live in this park. Lovely place for a walk around.. Even on a rainy day it was really fun to walk around. Found a cute little coffee shop for a bite to eat, lovely food, great coffee and stunning cake.. But the service was a  tand bit shocking.. Ended up paying for stuff I never got... One of the biggest park in dublin.. I think we were able to visit one side of the park only which is where the deer are. better if you will bring snack/food(i dont know if this is allowed but we saw there are some who brought foods) for the deer so you can take a photo with them upclose It was so nice with really good food. Everything was fairly priced and all the workers were super nice. The animals we nice and active and seemed happy. We went here to see reindeer, but unfortunately we haven t seen them, but the scenery and grass are beautiful and we have a great time there. Such a pleasant day to wander through the park and build a muse in your mind. A real spiritual energy permeated through my soul from the moment I stepped foot within. The chilly wind hit my face and I felt a tingly shudder against my neck and I just knew I was going to have a great walk. Nice dears too. Very tame. Not aggressive. Great park to visit when in Dublin if you re looking to get away from the busy streets for a bit of fresh air. At the park you can easily find the deers by the trees in the middle of the park, they are friendly and love to be fed. Well recommended. A wonderful place. So clean and well-maintained. The deer are located near the cricket club. A huge park that would require a whole day to enjoy fully - even a whole day might not be enough for this beautiful place. Friendly deer, manicured grounds, beautiful folliage for walks. Parking available, great for runners, bikers and general stroll. The best is the deer families you get to see up close. First ever visit to Phoenix park was awesome. I will probably need about 3 or 4 visits to be able to review this park extensively. There are very long stretches of greenery with well kept walkways in this park. Had the opportunity of seeing the deer up close. Just check out the pictures and videos. Great park. Great environment. We need these kind of parks in every city. Green will save us. Big big big open flat ground with a few deers. Nothing really to see. We rented bicycles for this...it is a wize investment. Or else you pointlessly walk hours and hours...And ride on bicycle lanes or you get yelled at. Left side always!!     We learned the hard way! Biggest urban park from Europe. You find Dublin Zoo, Wellington Monument, Knockmaree Dolmen,Papal Cross,The Phoenix Monument,Ashton Castle , Irish ambassy, USA ambassy the lovely deers, ducks on the bottom lake, and natures amazing sound. Nice for long walks, running, amazing view over the City , Guinness factory  , open 24h . Awesome park, the biggest in a capital city in Europe, free roaming deer, squirrels, foxes and hipsters. Theres a nice tea room with a terrace with a good selection of coffees, cakes, sandwiches and rifles to shoot squirrels & hipsters. They have a scoreboard and buy pelts. Enjoy I had a delightful experience at Phoenix Park! The serene atmosphere, coupled with the chance to meet friendly deer up close, made my walk truly memorable. The fact that the deer are unafraid of people adds an extra special touch to this beautiful natural haven. Amazing park, it s the most biggest park in Europe, free entrance, you can rent a cycle, but I recommend rent Dublin Bike for the price, but it s more heavy, bring water Amazing park! If you walk a little bit and go where you see all the trees you can find these dears! There are so cute and fun to watch. Sometimes you even get to see them all run together and it s really cute. I would 100% reccomend going here. Also across the street s little bit there is a zoo. One of the largest parks of Ireland. Such a clean and calm place for taking refreshing ones life. The park is super super huge so of course we didnt go through all of it, but its such a beautiful place for relaxing, chatting or running. It was originally formed as a royal hunting Park in the 1660s and opened to the public in 1747. A large herd of wild fallow deer still remain to this day. The Park is also home to the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre, Aras an Uachtarain, Zoological Gardens, Victorian Flower Gardens, a Biodiversity Information Centre, Phoenix Park Cafe and Tea Rooms.  The Phoenix Park is only a mile and a half from O Connell Street. Both passive and active recreational pursuits may be pursued such as walking, running, polo, cricket, hurling and many more. The Glen Pond is set in very scenic surrounds in the Furry Glen. There are many walks and cycle trails available to the public.  Please note that BBQs are not permitted in the Phoenix Park. The Phoenix Park is open 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week, all year round. The main gates of the Park at Parkgate Street and Castleknock Gate are open 24 hours. Phoenix Park is very large, I did not go all the way, nor did I see the legendary lovely deer. Must be a next time. into the park directly by those large lawns and trees to shock, very suitable for quiet persons walking or jogging over there. there are not many people, the whole scenery let people indulge in it, can be very quiet to spend half a day. Loved walking around the area! Its a huge park and also houses the Dublin zoo (which I didnt see). There are also small cafes to catch a coffee break or if you need to use the loo! I totally recommend visiting it if you are in Dublin! Absolutely magic place! Highly recommend for family walks or any other types of walks. We met dears and were delighted Great place to play football with kids or have a picnic Whether youre seeking a peaceful retreat or a leisurely encounter with nature, Phoenix Park is place to go to. Love this place. A huge and very well maintained park. You can spend a very good day and a nice walk there. The largest city park in Europe great for strolling, walking, jogging or cycling. On a fine day bring a packed lunch for a pinic. This is the best park for me in Ireland. It is huge and also very good for a nice walk. I like the tea rooms here. There is also a amazing zoo and a restaurant in zoo called meerkat. They have deers   and it is very good experience. One should go here for a walk and also say Hi to deers A very very beautiful park, I loved my visit! Enough to disconnect for the time of a very nice walk! Best park in Dublin,my favourite place to visit and enjoy a long walking Great and huge big area to share with family and friends, you can walk, run, cycling, and play with plenty of space. There are coffee places and the zoo access as well. The most beautiful part is to meet friendly and cute deers around the park. major tips: 1) bring ur own carrots for attracting the deers (cut long thin slices to optimize for amount and distance so they don t reach you); 2) rent a bike to find them in this huge park and rentals can be done on site for 7 euro / hour ish; 3) budget more than 1hour cause there s so much to do and the time goes by fast! we saw about 70-100 deers in 2-3 packs on the left side of the park (if u come in from the main entrance). can ask the bike rental guy for their whereabouts by season. some deers are more open to engage with you (and your carrots) than others. the reindeers are honestly massive and can be a bit intimidating when they get the hang of you feeding them and wanting more food. but overall they are super cute and friendly and the view is amazing during the sunset hours. an excellent / must-do activity in dublin :)"
149,Phoenix Park Visitor Centre,4.35,"Love this area, very good for given your dog a good run around. Most dogs off the leash which is really good to see, as I d prefer my dog off her lead. Coffee places close by too. Nice and peaceful especially when the weather is bad, not a single person around The visitor centre has a two storey exhibition detailing the history of the park over the last five centuries. Its free to visit. The centre also has a cafe with indoor and outdoor seating and a large car park. Its next to the walled Victorian garden, which is also worth a visit and is also free. Wait time We were pleasantly surprised by this small but proud and informative exhibition. Some interesting info about this area and park. Well worth a visit if youre in the area. Find out about the historical past and local information. Nice food and drinks area as well. Staff very helpful Visited on Amazing Personal and a cute exhibition bout the history of Phoenix Park. The tour of the castle is really worth it. But it is really cold in there so bring a jacket. Great centre, good food, ice cream. Very busy, too crowded at the weekend - be aware. With the Ashtown castle and Victorian style kitchen garden, with a maize park it is perfect for families with kids. For a nice sunny day outside with lots of dog walkers,perfect walk. Very huge park,fun for outdoors activities What a fantastic experience especially seeing the deer and cute little hole in the wall pub , recommend taking the family especially on a sunny day An ideal park for family photos and fun. The park is beautifully flowered and well laid out, with tables and plenty of space for young and old alike. More examples on my website and on my Google maps profile. Visiting Aras an Uachtarain hourly tour was probably one of the Best experience s of our lives , lady @ visitor centre was extremely friendly and helpful and the tour guide was excellent sharing the history along with a modern twist and stories of interest in each room visited. Strictly no photography inside Aras. We regularly frequent the dog friendly visitor centre cafe as they have a great outdoor sitting space partly covered and its the best cafe in the area for freshly prepared food, making All their own produce on site. Their menu is always on display with the prices for the excellent fare and service,  so not the cheapest. Some busy  days you can wait up to 10 minutes to be served if a tour bus pulls in ahead of you, but most times its just a couple of minutes or quicker. CAFE  UPDATE  EDIT. 10/MARCH/2024 Under new management Retained the original baker - cook, so some of the traditional fresh baked favourites are still on offer with some new recipes to look forward to adding to the freshly prepared vegetables. On the downside, I dont mind paying a little extra for good quality fresh produce, but the little amount of fresh cream they offer you as a topping is abysmal, so come on PPC, a good tablespoon full of fresh cream at least. We didnt go into the centre but the area is a lovely place to visit on a sunny day. Beautiful for a walk around the grounds, for a picnic, or you can sit and grab a coffee or some lunch in the cafe. Lovely outside area. Nice tea shop / cafe and very good kids playground. Unfortunately the Centre itself was closed when we visited When recently in the Phoenix park, we fell into the Visitor Centre when we finally found it!! Its not immediately obvious! But worth finding it! Wonderful food, outside dining if wanted, fast coffee stall outside in case it s just coffee required. Gorgeous food, great atmoshere! Fantastic situation with the tower just outside. Have a peek in at the walled garden on the say and oh, did I mention the HUGE car park!! Whats not to love!!! Good venue to walk around and have  refreshments. Good car parking and bus access. NB. Expect 20+ minute wait to access bathrooms. Great spot for the family! The car park is located in front of the walled garden. We took a stroll through here and saw some of the largest pumpkins ever. The gardens are maintained by the OPW. At the side of the walled garden is the cafe and visitor centre. Did not eat here, so cannot comment on the food but it was quite busy on a Saturday morning. Right in front on the cafe is a small castle/keep with a small maze garden around it, great for the kiddos. If you walk around the back of the visitor centre it leads to the playground. The playground is very well maintained and keep them busy for a bit!! Beware of the coffee queue, it was 30 people long on a Sunday! If you are visiting Phoenix Park, make sure to visit this place too. It will take just a few minutes, there is not a lot to see, but its worth it. It is for free and your kids will like it. There is also some history pieces mentioned in some of the walls. It was good to read them. There is also a small cave like area, my baby loved it. I recommend this place. Lovely coffee shop with very friendly staff and great selection of sandwiches and cakes..We both had a chicken ciabatta with avocado and they were really good..lovely day for a stroll around..Ice creams and picnic area were busy with families We visited the park during the day, and stopped by the visitor center and walled garden to stroll through. Very pleasantly surprised - the walled garden has loads of vegetables, fruits, and flowers growing within (which are also supposedly used by the Presidents house kitchen within the park). The stone building next to the visitor center is really cool too; and the visitor center has some nice information and history to pass along. Truth be told, I had a brownie at the stand, and it was absolutely fantastic! We were planning on going to feed the ducks in the little forest just after the first roundabout when you come in Castleknock gate. There was literally nowhere to park so we went to Monkey Village instead. The young kids love to climb in the big trees we didnt even get to the playground my youngest just loved the trees and seen so many squirrels I dont understand why you cant park on the side of the road anymore, even in the parking spaces. I understand parking in the grass upsets the ground area but Im going there since I was a kid and love bringing my own boys there I really hope they allow parking again soon. Such a beautiful park and so well kept visitor centre is worth a ramble with the kids. Pics are only a fraction of the visitors centre theres playground and other things to see too!! New cafe is terrible, really took the food out of the visit to the visitors centre. The food is of low quality and prepared off-site, the coffee is dire. Probably wont be visiting here again unless its for a particular event You have to prepare yourself physically for this park. It was a nice walk in a perfect setting! We had very good weather so we were able to enjoy it until nightfall. We also had the chance to see the deer which roam freely in the park. Several groups walk around the park so you can often come across them! Its a great place to have lunch or a coffee and enjoy the outdoor space with family, dogs and friends. I really recommend this pet friendly place. Helpful staff. Caffee and exhibition on site.Come early to avoid disappointment all tickets gone to visit House of President by 2pm.Starts from 10:30,last admission 3:30.Visitor centre works till 5 pm Its ok, but it us FREE! Nice bit of history on display.  This is where you can get tickets    for Michael Ds house,  The Aras Lovely way to get the history of the park, staff always so obliging. My favourite area to hang out in the Phoenix Park. The Cafe has amazing food and the best scones in Dublin. The walled garden is always well maintained and great to look at, as well as the beautiful trees. I enjoyed the love animals outside. Cafe next to the visitor centre is wonderful. There is free parking and toilets available. Lovely food. As a result of the quality and the location, there can be a queue to get served but it moves quickly. Extensive outdoor dining area. Very large enclosed playground nearby. Dont forget to take a stroll in the walled garden it is attached to, so you see where some of the produce you just enjoyed comes from. The coffee van outside is awful. Terrible service and watery, burnt coffee. Beautiful spot of a catch-up with family and children. Food is nice but expensive Lots to do here for free! Very child friendly.  Open spaces for kids to play. Safety away from roads, picnic tables for families to bring their own food for a more affordable day out! Dogs welcome  but be a responsible  owner!Well maintained toilets . Great cafe to sit in and also hubs outside for ice creams and quick snacks. Best so far...free park! Special dig for artifacts lol good day and nice playground beside the visitors center too. Goid spot for a coffee and a cake after a walk. The courtyard is Dog friendly and overall the whole place is nice and chilled out. Make sure to check out the walled garden too. Lovely place to visit! Amazing coffee! Great space. Amazing scones lovely vibes. Dog friendly Can you tell the puppet who works at reception that it might be useful to tell visitors to the presidential palace that the meeting point is at the visitor center and not in front of the palace gates? Great area to see love the walled garden  esp when bloom in on It was a nice sunny day.  The courtyard was beautifully laid out,  even after a very busy lunchtime. A breeze came from somewhere.  After a short while, I had to leave my friends.  Two cars full of people whom I had not seen in a very long time. OK, I have poor health and mobility issues.  However, on this occasion, I actually started shivering.  So, back to the car on my own.  Here, I sweltered in the heat , which I was glad of. While walking through the serving  did not detect indoor facilities. I am aware of the trend for outdoor eating.  Trying to follow our Central European friends  What a damp squid I am,  CHOICE would be a great concept to be grabbed at. Please,  someone take this up on a sliding scale?  To start with. I have friends In Lyon and other  cities.  I assure you if there is the slightest breeze, etc, and they are ready for indoors.  Over the years, I see residents women and men wearing the proverbial light black cardigan all year round. Lastly,  now that this monstrous craze is unfolded around Ireland     there will be diabolical consequences,  mark my words. Oops, I was out for a hopefully nice interlude with friends. No, I didnt have a pleasant time.  Unless I can be told there is an indoor space,  I will never be back.  And that is a shame for a property in State Lands. M.B.B Lastly, I am registered disabled . Trying to get across the cobbles was a nightmare both ways. The largest park in Europe! Nice, clean and beautiful!!"
150,Proper Order Coffee Co,4.85,"I know its a coffee spot but the bakery really takes the cake so to speak. Small shop with no inside seating but the bakery makes up for it with fresh, tastey treats. The almond croissant is amazing and the cookie was one of the best I had while in Dublin. Tried out the new location today,  right behind Tescos in Smithfield. Very clean and spacious.  Had a cardamom bun which was fabulous,  unique and a wonderful flavour combo. The coffee is prepared beautifully,  a roast I hadnt tried before with a fruity note to it. Plenty of standing space in the cafe and a good number of sit down spots as well. Looking forward to trying out the other pastries. Please bring in loyalty cards,  Ill be popping in again! Great coffee and service, new location has lots of space and is dog friendly. Good pastries as well Walked over to this amazing takeout-only coffee & pasties place for breakfast this morning. I ordered a latte and the gentleman behind the counter recommended this double chocolate cruffin thing when I asked for a pasty suggestion and said I usually get a chocolate croissant. I was very happy with my choice. The coffee was good and the pastry was excellent. Flaky and not too sweet with a couple of bits of chocolate in it. As other reviewers mentioned, there is no seating available here. This place is takeout only and they do NOT accept cash. I was remiss and did not take a photograph of either the current menu or the front door. I shall have to remedy this when I return to Dublin later in the week. I highly recommending finding Proper Order Coffee Co if you are ever in the area! Seriously good coffee (all 4 of us made the same remark upon tasting our coffees). Really yummy pastries too. Pity you cant sit down at the cafe to enjoy it. This cafe is always busy every weekend, so get ready to stand in queue  The pastries and focaccia are fantastic, and the coffee is also good. Pastries are always almost sold out before 1 pm, so try to get there before 1 pm! pretty cute corner cafe with delicious looking pastries and smooth flat white. there is limited / no seating though, so almost take out only. One of the best tasting flat whites I ever had and excellent cinnamon bun The coffee is amazing, really good quality! The cardamom bun was ridiculously good!!! So tasty, richer and fresher than some I ve had in Sweden haha  They also use compostable coffee cups. Such a great place! Look forward to coming back :)) This place was delicious!  We came for an afternoon snack and coffee and were so pleased with the pastries we picked!  We tried 4 on total, with the cardamom being my personal favorite.  Our mochas were just right for a rainy walk around the block.  The service was kind, but unfortunately, there is no sitting space in this cafe. My favourite place in Dublin. Keeps exceeding all my expectations. The best specialty coffee I ever had, very nice attitude. Love this place and always come a long way here. You are amazing! Superb. Exactly the right amount of choice and fantastic attention to detail. Their coffee is on point and the bakery is absolute divine. When you turn up and theres a queue at 9:30am on a cold weekday, you know theres good things happening. If you re a coffee lover, the place is for you. They have a variety of bins and trust me they know how to use them. Their coffee latte is a state of art. Unfortunately they don t have a place to relax with your cup of coffee - they only have coffee to go. Also, we had to wait 5 minutes in the queue to order and 5 minutes in a queue to receive an order. But waiting worth it, and I still recommend the place. Definitely my favourite coffee in Ireland. Absolute stunners of baristas, specially the woman with pink hair - think she is the owner (or perhaps a manager) but love her recommendations, always spot on, always kind and smiling. Had their pour over and it was crazy delicious! Anyone who has left a poor review simply doesn t know coffee. This is some of the finest I ve had. Fantastic customer service, beautifully roasted and brewed espresso, perfectly steamed milk. It s any coffee lover s dream. The pastry program is also outstanding. One of the highlights of my trip to Dublin. Proper Order in Smithfield, Dublin make one of the tastiest and most aroma-rich cups of coffee in town. Not a lot of places in Dublin can rival their coffee, in my view. We found the staff to be friendly too. The cups of coffee aren t cheap but they are premium quality so it s understandable. Proper Order have a strong recommendation from me! Probably the best takeaway coffee in Dublin. Pastries are good too but I kind of wish they would also have the ordinary muffins, plain croissants and pain au chocolate too. Great coffee and today I got a splendid Christmas     Mince pie  . Keep up the great work Made a repeat visit on my weekend holiday. Day one, got a lovely oat flat white and just lusted over the pastries in the window. Came back day two and got an equally lovely oat milk latte, and a cardamom bun Id probably do crimes for. Both times the service was great. If youre on holiday, skip the hotel breakfast and make this your first stop on the days adventures. Im jealous of everyone local to this place. In my opinion, this is the best coffee in town! I really like it. They dont have a lot of pastries options, but I think for this reason they can focus in quality. Cappucino was very good. You can trust the place, they know their game. Coffee and pastries are very good. Even tho this is very important. Customer service is more important, and this is not as good as the coffee and pastries. Cute little coffee shop that serves really good coffee and pastries. We walked in around 10:30 and sadly there was nowhere to sit but in no time at all we had two flat whites and an Americano to go. We also got a cronut type thing that was absolutely delicious. The pastries could rival any bakery and included cinnamon rolls and croissants. They sell coffee from The Coffee Collective & Square Mile for you to take home too. It s a little on the expensive side considering the portion sizes for coffee but it was really nice. Nice takeaway shop. Had the whiskey caramel latte and plenty of their pastries. Everything was delicious! You should come as early as you can if you want specific pastries, as they sell out very quickly. Also be aware that it s not a spot for cheap goods :) Recommended by a friend to this special cafe, takeaway only but selling some really good coffee and pastry. Cute logo design, love the details! There are not many good bakeries in Dublin, and this one is definitely among the best. Some specials can be a hit or miss, but the products are always fresh anyway. Pastries 10/10 as usual but my last 2-3 trips to Proper Order the coffee has been extremely disappointing. Curdled milk is not a good look or taste either! Best coffee place in Smithfield area in Dublin. Totally recommended! A lot of coffee selection. Just take away Amazing place with great variety of specialty coffee! They also have fresh pastry Highly recommend trying batch brew on anaerobic Columbia accompanied by delicious bun with peaches Amazing find and great coffee, you know it s going to be good when there s a que to order on a Sunday morning. So goo I done a lap of Dublin City Center and went back for more Would recommend Food Lovely coffee and pastries, I wish they had tables/chairs. Tried oat latte, almond brioche and cardamom bun. Love the coffee here and the cardamom bun    no gf options that I know of though unforch Great coffee with the best pastry in town from No Messin bakery! CardiB and rhubarb tart are one of my many favorites! No indoor or outdoor seats but Smithfield square is just a stone throw away. The coffee is great but what you re really here for is the Cardi B. The most succulent cardamom bun on the face of the earth. Best baked goods in the world. The sourdough focaccia bread was the best bread Ive had. Was looking for some good coffee in Dublin, this did not disappoint. Great coffee! Pastry was delicious too. Lovely coffee, simple menu, delicious pastries, highly recommend These folks respect coffee. I ordered from the filter menu and it was a delicious cup of coffee; complex yet balanced. Baristas are elite and the beans they use are of the highest quality. The water for the filter brew took a while to get to temperature, so I had to wait a bit longer than expected. To make up for the wait, they treated me to a free pastry from No Messin  bakery; also delicious. I hope to be back to try a drink from their espresso menu, and another pastry. The pastries are well made and seem creative and seasonal. The coffee on the other hand was way too small for  3.5 and not even hot enough to begin with. I tried the Cardi B cardamom bun and the chocolate danish, both were made very well. As a Colombian, I can attest this is good coffee! Also, very friendly service and efficient."

This subsequently allowed us to have a better idea of which neighborhoods to return to explore. Our guide knew how to captivate us and adapt to young and old alike.

C etait un reel moment de partage et de bonheur . A very nice tour of the Secret Corners of Dublin with Aurelie who was a pleasure to meet. During our visit, Aurelie allowed us to discover Dublin and a little of its history during 2.5 hours which passed very (too) quickly, and gave us directions to interesting places to visit on our own. His passion for Ireland is infectious and we had a great time. If we could give it more than 5/5 we would. We took the must-sees of Dublin, wonderful visit.

And all this in a very natural and fluid exchange. A very nice meeting for us that we recommend. We were in Dublin and this getaway to this wonderful place did us the greatest good, a few minutes from the city center accessible by Dart, this visit should not be missed. Aurelie is very responsive in the discussions preceding the visit, she even goes so far as to give you the train times to get to the meeting place. Very professional For a short weekend, we called on Aurelie to take a tour of the must-sees of Dublin. Aurelie, while remaining focused on the route, does not hesitate to personalize the visit according to the visitors. Lots of advice, a little history, geography, a little about his feelings, and the visit is very enriching. An urban walk accessible to everyone: dont hesitate to call Aurelie, you wont regret. Aurelie is a super passionate and exciting guide. Always a good address to share to make our stays more pleasant. Knows the history of the city as well as all its anecdotes.

152,RoCo Cafe,4.75,"Wonderful little cafe! We loved our coffees as well as the homemade pork & fennel sausage roll (to die for!) and banana & choc muffin. The staff were also exceptionally friendly. Wish we had more time to try the other delicious treats. Ladies and Gentlemen, the best lunch i had for quite some time. The grilled chicken BLT wrap at this cafe was excellent. I could have had a few more to be honest. The ambiance is wonderful, the calming music, nice decoration..a truly come back again. And offcourse, very nice staff. Great spot & friendly service! Upstairs and outdoor seating available. Food Stopped for lunch and a cuppa while exploring the city. Food was lovely (warm chicken BLT wrap) and the staff were nice and friendly. It really makes all the difference. Thanks. Food The BEST burrito I have ever eaten in my life! Also the best staff, atmosphere 10/10!! Favourite cafe I ve been to in Dublin! Absolutely gorgeous coffee with an incredible fennel sausage roll that put me on cloud nine   almost quit my job to move to Dublin on the spot after one bite. Staff were extremely attentive and friendly. The menu included vegan options and dairy alternatives. Very tasty vegan options, cute little space with some small tables and seats upstairs,  friendly service I had 3 mornings in Dublin and came here every one of those mornings for a flat white and vegan breakfast! Tiny spot but super cute and very nice staff. Thanks for great service and vegan food! Beautiful little spot with upstairs seating. Opted for the table outside and did some people watching. Great staff and great coffees. Had some breakfast wraps and burrito wrap. Kept us going for a few hours of walking and whiskey tasting! Great place for a cozy breakfast experience. The price-performance ratio is absolutely right. Vegan options available:) I had the pleasure of visiting RoCo Caffe, and it was an absolute delight. Their vegan breakfast options left me thoroughly impressed. I started with the Vegan Sausage Roll (v), a flavorful combination of Portobello mushrooms, mixed nuts, vegan mozzarella, and chickpeas. It was generously sprinkled with toasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, creating a satisfying crunch with every bite. Next up was the Vegan Smash Sandwich (V) on Tartines organic four seed sourdough. The blend of creamy avocado, cooked beetroot, semi-dried tomato, RoCo hummus, and fresh rocket was a harmonious explosion of flavors and textures. It was a true vegan masterpiece. To satisfy my sweet tooth, I indulged in a Blueberry Croissant that was baked to perfection. The burst of blueberries in every bite was a delightful surprise. Lastly, the Cherry & Flaxseed Crown was the perfect ending to this memorable meal. It was not only delicious but also a testament to the cafes commitment to quality ingredients. The service at RoCo Caffe was top-notch, with a professional and kind staff who made my dining experience even more enjoyable. The atmosphere was cozy, creating the ideal setting for a relaxing meal. I can wholeheartedly recommend RoCo Caffe to anyone looking for a vegan-friendly, gourmet breakfast experience. The attention to detail in both the food and service sets this cafe apart. I cant wait to return and explore more of their menu! Great coffee and pastries! Loved the vegan options. Place is a little small, with a few seats upstairs, better for takeaway Dietary restrictions: Vegan options available Really good coffee. Some of the best I ve had in Dublin. Homemade sausage rolls are great. Don t know why they don t do a straightforward trad breakfast because they would do it really well. Incredibly friendly staff and cute cafe with a wide variety of vegan options - oat milk cappuccino was on point and I got the vegan sausage roll (made of mushrooms) and vegan smash sandwich to go which both were super tasty and just perfect for a trip on the train. Must visit as a vegan when in Dublin :) Friendly staff, recommend the breakfast burrito it was well worth it. The potatoes are magical! Keep up the good work team. Cosy place with good coffee, and many lactose free milk options. Great tea options from Wall and Keogh as well. The barista was be a bit sloppy, and the kitchen  looked a bit messy but as I said before the coffee was great and the staff friendly. There is additional space for 10-12 people upstairs. Unfortunately the windows are small thus the view its not something special. I had a croissant and a breakfast burrito. They were bought to the table with our drinks. The service was really good. All staff members really happy and so helpful. Well priced. If you get a chance check it out Great spot for lunch and coffee. Just sit and watch h the people go by. Staff super friendly and atmosphere very relaxed. Cozy place, nice service, delicious Chai Latte! Cute little cafe with a nice variety of teas and coffees for sitting down or take away. A couple warm and cold sandwiches and baked goods, free mint water, and friendly service. Unfortunately the gingerbread latte was less than desirable - leaving a weird taste of Indian food after every sip, which is only barely covered by too much sweetness. The tea is served hot, and in a double cup as to not burn your hands (which only kinda works, see the solution with the napkin). Overall would not get coffee here again. Pastries could still be good though, and the service was kind and welcoming. Great little coffee shop. Lovely selection of baked goods, blueberry scones are a definite guilty pleasure. Coffee is made perfectly every time. Its compact, and popular. Seating upstairs has a nice view for watching the world go by especially if its raining. Food Great little coffee shop. Very friendly service. Tasty coffee and pastries. Nice toilet too!! Delicious vegan burrito, good coffee, and friendly servers. The WiFi is sstrong but there are no outlets (which does seem to be the norm in that area). RoCo has a warm, welcoming vibe (especially in the chilly winter). Their flat white and pain au chocolate were delicious. Definitely would return. Perfect spot in the centre of the city for a quick lunch stop durin your visit of Dublin. After a morning walking, feels good to sit in a cozy space and order a hot sandwich or a wrap. I saw they also serve sweets, brioches and hot beverages if you rather stop in the afternoon. And if youre on the run you can come in and swiftly buy a sandwich they have on the counter already wrapped. Very friendly atmosphere, nice service, good coffee and dog friendly. Greetings Maggie from Germany great atmosphere the moment we stepped in the door. seating upstairs with a lovely view out onto the street, nice decor. the menu had a great variety of veggie & vegan options, so there was something for everyone. delicious coffee. service was friendly. We had coffee and a vegan sausage roll. The sausage roll itself was fine and the coffee was very good. The staff was not very friendly and it seemed like we were somehow inconveniencing them by being there. I won t go back unfortunately Weve ordered atleast 4 times in the last month on deliveroo and every time its perfect. Fresh vegetable soup a gf and vegan smash bagel and regular meat options for my partner its like a dream. It always comes hot and packaged perfectly so my soup has never spilled honestly I cannot fault anything about RoCo have a great Christmas and a deserved break!! Really like it here... I visit every morning for some coffee and very nice energy balls that are hand made and healthy. Sitting in is nice and warm, the soup combo is great! Recommended to me for great COFFEE & food - absolutely didnt disappoint, plus lovely staff! Glad to say I have a new job in the area, so my loyalty card will get regular use!! A bit on the pricey side though! Coffee is not good for specialty coffee place. Got a flat white extra hot, too bitter and milk not well steamed. There are some other better coffees in the area. Such a lovely little place, a hidden gem in Dublin. It is actually very small, so dont be too surprised, but it is cosy and the coffee and their roiboos tea were excellent! Friendly service, great decorations and good location. suchhhh friendly staff and the coffee was amazing, wasn t over or under extracted just right I really like this cafe. this cafe have a nice vibe and nice cafe and finally really good coffee. i think this cafe Barista is really good skill. if i visit Dublin again, i will visit here again. Thank you for having cozy time in here. Perfect location, we had coffee so I cant share my opinion on food . Food Lovely little place! I tried the chicken BLT, and it was absolutely delicious. The combination of tender chicken, crispy bacon, fresh lettuce, and juicy tomatoes was fantastic. The staff members were super friendly and helpful, providing great service. The cozy and inviting atmosphere of the place added to the overall enjoyable experience. Interesting enough I also had a camomile tea which I honestly thought they were the same everywhere but this was definitely the best one I had so far haha unexpected surprise Nice little cafe in Dublin. Their Chai Latte is excellent, as well as the Rooibos. Their cakes are too. Vegetarian options: Several vegan products sausage rolls amazing as were the scones and soup. staff friendly and chatty."
153,Rock of Dunamase,4.75,"One of the largest old ruins scattered across Ireland with a stunning entrance. The grounds are large and well worth exploring, stunning views on a sunny day. All sorts of interesting areas, some lovely opening in the walls to get good photos and a fantastic location to visit, Great parking and a nice little church beside to enjoy too, cheers Well worth to visit. The castle is situated on top of a hill and has a stunning 360deg views towards Co. Laois. It is free and there are plenty of parking spaces. Amazing ruins of a former castle. Free to visit with parking at the bottom. Views of the surrounding countryside are worth it alone. We had no problems with the narrow road in our campervan but it s probably not suitable for motorhomes or wide vehicle in general. Nice ruins integrated into the landscape. Its usually very windy at the top. It is worth going to see the sunset because sometimes it can surprise you with its beauty. the remains of the castle are raw and have been slowly decaying for 300 years. A nice place, luckily not yet commercialized Beautiful place to stop and explore.  Fantastic views Put these breathtaking castle ruins of the 12th century Norman lord Strongbow and his wife Aoife, the Irish princess on your list of detours off the M7. It sits precariously on a massive chunk of rock. The ruins are both evocative and enchanting. They re high up on my list of Irish ruins because they speak to the heart as the Normans became more Irish than the Irish themselves. It s a treasure of a find for any off the beaten track traveller. I didnt know this place existed...less famous than its near neighbour The Rock of Cashel, but a similar concept & less busy,so you can really look  around Amazingly picturesque part of of Ireland and only 5 mins from M7. A nice stop off spot on route from Dublin to Cork The Rock of Dunamase is a place of wonder and enchantment, where the echoes of ancient legends seem to linger in the air. Climbing up the rugged paths to reach its summit, I felt a sense of excitement and anticipation building with each step. As I stood atop the weathered ruins, overlooking the sweeping vistas of the Irish countryside, I couldnt help but marvel at the sheer magnitude of history that surrounded me. It was a moment of pure awe, tinged with a profound appreciation for the resilience of the human spirit across the ages. Exploring the nooks and crannies of this ancient fortress with friends made the experience even more memorable, as we shared laughter and stories against the backdrop of centuries-old stone. The Rock of Dunamase isnt just a destination; its a journey through time, leaving an indelible mark on the soul. Very rural but extremely hands-on experience. If you like to get into the nitty-gritty & actually feel the 9th century. Throw in absolutely stunning views of the surrounding valleys & villages & youre in for a treat! From the top of the rock, youll be rewarded with panoramic vistas of the surrounding countryside. Its a perfect spot for capturing unforgettable photos or simply soaking up the fresh air and scenic beauty. The climb to the top is manageable for most ages, and theres plenty of space for kids to explore the ruins while learning about the castles past. While its a gravel path to the top, youll only be able to take a stroller to a certain point; so do keep that in mind if youre bringing one! This place is great to visit on a sunny day. We had hours of fun exploring and climbing. We even had a game of hide and seek with kids great crack and plenty of hiding spots!! Bring a picnic along and just take in all the scenery.. Fun days dont have to cost much. Exploring the Rock of Dunamase in County Laois, Ireland Nestled in the heart of County Laois, Ireland, the Rock of Dunamase stands as a testament to the rich history and breathtaking beauty of the Emerald Isle. Perched atop a dramatic limestone outcrop, this ancient fortress has witnessed centuries of intrigue, conquest, and resilience. As I explored its imposing ruins, I found myself captivated by its aura of mystery and grandeur. The first thing that strikes visitors is the commanding presence of the Rock itself. Rising 150 feet above the surrounding countryside, it offers panoramic views of the rolling hills and lush greenery that define the Irish landscape. The sense of awe that washes over you as you approach is palpable, as if the very stones beneath your feet are whispering tales of bygone eras. Stepping through the weathered archway that marks the entrance, you are instantly transported back in time. The ruins of Dunamase Castle, which dates back to the 9th century, are a maze of crumbling walls, moss-covered stones, and hidden passageways. Despite the ravages of time, the fortress retains an air of regal splendor, its former glory still evident in the intricate carvings and towering battlements. As you wander through the labyrinthine corridors, each turn reveals a new discovery. From the imposing Great Hall, where feasts once echoed with laughter and song, to the atmospheric dungeons, where prisoners languished in darkness, every corner of Dunamase Castle is steeped in history. I found myself lost in reverie, imagining the lives of those who once called this place home. One of the highlights of my visit was the breathtaking view from the summit of the Rock. As I stood atop the ancient ramparts, gazing out over the sweeping vista below, I felt a profound sense of connection to the land and its storied past. The juxtaposition of natural beauty and man-made marvel is truly awe-inspiring, a reminder of the enduring power of human ingenuity. In addition to its historical significance, the Rock of Dunamase also holds a special place in Irish folklore and mythology. Legend has it that the fortress was once the stronghold of Loegaire, a mythical warrior king whose exploits are woven into the fabric of Irish legend. As I explored the ruins, I couldnt help but feel a sense of reverence for the ancient tales that have been passed down through generations. In conclusion, a visit to the Rock of Dunamase is an unforgettable experience that offers a glimpse into Irelands rich and storied past. Whether youre a history buff, a nature enthusiast, or simply someone seeking adventure off the beaten path, this majestic landmark has something to offer everyone. So pack your walking shoes, bring your sense of wonder, and prepare to be transported back in time as you embark on a journey to the heart of County Laois. Really worth a visit.  Just off the motorway Must have been a formidable stronghold in its day. Great ruins to visit. Free, with some parking (not a car park, just some street parking). Went on a cold windy day, but still had a great time. The view is wonderful. We were the only ones there. Nice place with the ruins to visit on a sunny day. Street parking available for few cars. Getting there was a bit tricky due to the Electric Picnic .. It mustve been a magnificent castle.  Now everything is under the ruins.  I hope this was restored to a better state. No tickets and the car park was very small. A magical place That is FREE Parking along the road FREE room for about 10 cars .. Great place for kids & families loads rocks to climb up and around .This castle ruins is a perfect location for drones ...I had the best fun capturing it Fantastic scenery and well kept a fortress when it was in operation Id imagine Had a wonderful quick visit to the Rock of Dunamase. The panoramic views were absolutely breathtaking, offering a sweeping vista of the surrounding countryside. A must-visit for anyone interested in history and natural beauty. Its a peaceful place with excellent views. It was not very crowded which makes it even more peaceful. The views from the top were breathing. You can see the whole county from above. The entrance is free.. If you are planning on visiting in Taxi, you might face issues on the return journey as most of the drivers might reject the trip due to the steep road that leads to the place. Its also a single road so your driving skills might be tested :) Overall a good place to visit if you are in Portlaoise. Really nice little gem in the side of the motorway for a picnic I didnt expect such a beautiful place. The castle is in round but you steel can see how big it was. The castle is perched on a massive rock. Thats why it is call the Rock of Dunamase. I totally recommend visiting this place. If you have children be careful with them, too many rocks to be climbed and some of them dangerous Unbelievably beautiful location with great history definitely worth visiting. This was a perfect stop! You can really take in the scale see these ruins! It sits atop a hill that has panoramic views of the world below. I could have spent hours climbing around the rocks! This is a free stop! Great place to visit. Wonderful castle ruins. Doesnt get too busy but would recommend a weekday visit as you might have the place to yourself. This was probably my favorite castle. It s of the beaten path and not too many people come here. The castle is not in the best conditions but the views are one of the best. The climb is a bit steep but is doable. Free parking on the premises. There is also a church which is in very good conditions. Nice, short walk up to the ruins, easy for anybody to do. Lovely views from the top. Lovely, Historical places with amazing views. Its worth to visit, especially in the good weather. We even had our picnic here. Lovely spot for some exploring and visiting a piece of history. Also has a small church across and graveyard with some very old headstones. Be warned the walk up is very steep and some areas do not have railings - not wheelchair accessible due to steps at the entrance. I was surprised its in a bad way very run down which is a shame as the views around it are stunning, the government should spend a few quid on doing this place up instead of other stupid things, be careful when your going back down towards the carpark as its fairly steep and lethal with gravel seen a few people nearly hitting the ground, tarmac would help on that subject, its worth going to have a look ,this place would have great potential if a couple of mill were put into it We had a really good day when we visited that castle and enjoyed the stunning views of the surrounding countryside from the top. Known as the  hum  the fortress is on strategic place, easy to understand that it was important through the ages. It was used until the 14th century and even though under the 18th century as a residence but it didnt last. After that the castle belongs to the state. Strongly recommended for everyone who is visiting Ireland If the weather supports you and it is a bright sunny day, then it is a nice experience. Kids will love it, you have enough parking space for 15 to 20 cars. Popped in here after short trip to Stradbally.  Awesome piece of history which i had no idea was there.  Smll parking location and walk around the ruin with a good information plaque outlining histry of the castle. Location was quite busy so obviously popular.  Breathtaking views from the top of the rock and understandable from a defensive perspective why it was built there.  If in area highly recommended and just short distance from town where there is a nice cafe etc for refreshments sfter walk This is a little hidden gem. We loved walking around and getting a feel for what it would have looked like when it was in use. The views from the top are spectacular. I highly recommend taking your camera with you. There is no fee to enter. It is steep and as expected rocky in places. We managed in normal trainers so no need for special equipment or shoes though. Wow! What a place! What an experience! Its free, and self guided. The history of the place seeps from every rock and crevice.  Makes me mad to see people carving they dumb names into this piece of history. But the place is gorgeous, and windy! The Rock of Dunamase is an imposing and magnificent example of a Celtic fortification overlooking the valley of the O Moores, just outside Portlaoise, County Laois Dog friendly Free car parking Amazing atmosphere. Free entry.  Very clear. Easy access. Tips from locals: Capture some spectacular pictures of the Laois countryside from the top of the rock, especially at sunrise or sunset I visited as part of heritage week where we did a tour with the archaeologist who led excavations on the site in the 1990s. An amazing place with wonderful views and an interesting history. Ten severed heads were found on the site during the dig which were believed to have been used to ward off potential attackers. The Rock of Dunamase takes its name from the Irish Dun Masc, meaning the  Fort of Masc . Dunamase was the seat or fort of the ancient Irish kings of Laois. The surviving ruins are some of the most spectacular Anglo-Norman fortifications in the country. At the moment the car park is limited however plans are afoot to build a dedicated car park next year. Very nice historical place. Great views.Some notice boards about the history and chat the place would look like. It is usually very peaceful and quiet Super spot for a bit of history and a casual stroll. The rock is a little hidden gem, and next door Dysart woods is a maze of different trails of different grades. Dogs are welcome too."
154,Rosie's Cafe,4.425,"first cafe my mother and I went to when coming into Ireland and still after all the cafes we went to within the span of our sixteen day trip, it was still one of my favorites! good food, resonably priced, and the cappuccino was amazing! Small break on our way to St Patricks Cathedral. Warm welcome, the setting is pleasant, the view too. Savory and sweet are delicious. Good location and traditional food. Many choices of sandwiches which are very tasty. Nice little place in a pleasant neighborhood for a quick lunch. This little cafe offers sandwiches, salads and homemade cakes... Good for a little break before heading back to wander the streets of Dublin. Fair prices. Creative and fun food choices. It appears that most items are baked and made on site fresh each day  cappuccino was delicious. I ll definitely stop again for a snack. Very friendly and competent staff, fresh food, and a cozy and clean locale. Definitely worth visiting! We ordered three different sandwiches, and they were all very good! Food Gorgeous food and fantastic service! We came for breakfast and lunch on two occasions during our stay in Dublin. Salads are fresh and flavourful, the breakfast is beautiful and the cakes are amazing! Really great coffee too. Can t recommend more! Small, pleasant place with friendly service. You can feel the love of the people, hearty sandwiches with fresh ingredients, unbeatable value for money. We really liked the breakfast in the cafe. There is a good selection of baked goods and also a lot of hot food. I would definitely recommend the sandwiches, as they are not only very tasty in the morning. These were very fresh and were served relatively quickly by the nice staff. Especially the coffee and the cakes were also very good. However, we found the ambiance very loud and not really inviting for a cosy family breakfast. Another negative point is the price-performance ratio of vegan pancakes. The portion is very small (9 ), but tasted very good. I would not order them again. Nevertheless, we were very satisfied, as the cafe also has very favourable prices. What a great find! One of the best cappuccinos, lovely staff, and the breakfast burrito was delicious! Our kids loved the hot chocolate and croissants. Highly recommend if you stay near the Christchurch! Rosies recently had a refurbishment which reorganized the cafe seating and kitchen area. Sandwiches were  9 which is on the pricier end compared to cafes in the surrounding area. After the refurbishment those same sandwiches now cost  11.95 which is a 33% increase. The sandwiches are good but not that good. Very nice cosy coffee shop. Staff are very nice and welcoming. Coffee was just perfect I would cross the Atlantic Ocean and come all the way back to Dublin just to have the Cajun chicken sandwich again. Every flavor perfectly balanced, the bread crisp but not dry, just the right amount of potato chips. I will think about this sandwich until the day I die. Unbelievable meal and coffee with warm service, right near the hotel. Cannot recommend highly enough. Sublime. delicious! amazing staff! great food and coffee. Go here for breakfast but also the desserts are amazing!!! Carrot cake is DELICIOUS!!!! I love rosie s. What a lovely place for a very tasty breakfast. We stayed in Dublin for a week and had breakfast at Rosie  cafe at least four times. Which means we ate everything on their menu. Not once we had a bad experience, generous portion sizes, tasty breakfast naps and burritos. Great salads and cakes, when in Dublin and in the vicinity of this small cafe give it a try you will not be disappointed. Great place and atmosphere, but overly priced. One almond croissant and one cappuccino for 9.45 euros, around 30% more than similar places. Quality was ok. Cute cafe with tasty meal options. Wonderful little Cafe. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, great background music  , comfy seating, plenty of options for food and drink, vegetarian options which can easily be changed to Vegan. Would be great if they served Fairtrade tea, coffee and sugar Very stylish yet cosy cafe, you suddenly feel like home here. Youll get the best carrot cake of your life here. I already miss that cake terribly! Yes! Scrambled eggs and avocado is my favourite. Freshly prepared food, with grace. Rosie s Cafe is not fancy, but it certainly is good. As I sat and enjoyed my food, one of the staff was discreetly polishing the chairs and the bases of the tables. A good sign, I think. Delicious, ultra-fresh sandwiches. Super good coffee. Top address!! Very delicious bap with pulled pork and tuna  sandwich, also best capuchino with oat milk Ive had in Dublin. Cozy little place for lunch! The Italian sandwich on ciabatta with the veggie soup was exactly what I needed after a wet morning! Fresh ingredients. Great food. Good prices. We had the pleasure of eating at Rosies twice during our brief stay in Dublin. My husband had the Club sandwich both times & raved that it was fresh, hot & delicious! I had the Italian sandwich with prosciutto, sundried tomatoes & cheese on a baguette. Absolutely delicious!!  We told Victoria,  our server, that we were in a bit of a rush heading to the airport & she had our lunch ready in a flash!! Great, fresh, homemade food & wonderful service!! I once had a  trial  for a job here which basically involved working for free for a day. Unsurprisingly, I never heard anything back from them afterwards. I honestly don t think they were even hiring. Don t support businesses that take advantage of people looking for work in order to get free labour. Great spot for a coffee and a snack. Staff are kind and service is speedy though the interior is not so optimal as a cozy cafe should be, the brunch over here was amazing and the staffs were friendly. the price was reasonable compares to other brunch places. Also, there were a range of different cakes and coffees Lovely food, and staff and nice. Jazz music in the background. Recommend eggs Benedict A nice little place close to Christ Church Cathedral. My wife and I came here for lunch after a tour of the church. A nice place but unfortunately very small. We enjoyed the environment but it felt a bit cramped. The food was delicious and the prices were good. If I was nearby I would eat here again, but not regularly. The best vegan sausage roll I have ever tasted. Porridge was amazing. Great value for money and I would strongly recommend. Charming albeit a liitle small cafe with great lunch options, and of sweets ( cakes ).  Recommend any of the toasties Really nice staff...Lady cut out edge of the bread and cooked spinach because I had surgery on my teeth and I could eat only soft food I had the home-made quiche to go, it came with salad and little potatoes. Absolutely delicious. I (begrudgingly) gave a bit to my envious friend. She said it tasted as good as it looked. Vegetarian options: Really delicious home-made quiche, lots of lovely courgette etc. Good salad, too. We went there for lunch and although small had a gluten free tuna sandwich. The waitress was very helpful in checking that the mayonnaise was gf. But, we went for breakfast on our way out of Dublin and paid  nearly  12 for an extra small serve of scrambled eggs and avocado. They didn t have any gluten free bread to offer me but didn t take anything off of the  set  price! Wouldn t visit again or recommend for gluten free options! A very lovely place with great food and service! Definitily coming back again. The service was good , the place is clean ( not a standard in Dublin!) and the food is good although dont expect deals. Price wise ok, considering Dublin city ,they could have some deals. But the soup today...oh dear lord , so oversalted I felt insulted  I think it was supposed to be mushroom but really hard to determine considering the amount of salt..  I would have said something but I got it for takeaway so found out much later. Super cute place! We ate here multiple times during a city trip to Dublin. Food tastes nice & fresh, staff was knowledgeable about ingredients so food allergies where not a problem, and service was fast as well! Nice cafe with very reasonable prices and a very nice breakfast. They also have a selection of items for purchase if you need a small gift or something for the kitchen. The sandwiches are freshly made and delicious Delicious! A good find in the city."
155,SLICE,4.425,"They have a very small menu which is usually a good sign. We had to queue over half an hour before a table for free and during the wait we could see the plates being served to the other customers. They all looked great! We ordered our food with white some anticipation. My juice was super. The eggs & avocado & sausage looked beautiful and were very good. They had on display what looked like a beautiful carrot cake but instead we ended up choosing a pancake to share. It had great texture. I would have probably preferred some other topping though as I dont particularly enjoy pistachio & caramel. Lovely place for breakfast and brunch Delicious food and cake It was busy Sunday waited 20-30 mins for table overall its worth waiting. Only that it would be great if coffee could be a larger cup . My favourite cafe on the Northside. The staff are always so friendly, kind and welcoming and the atmosphere cozy. The food is always exceptional. I had soup here yesterday which was divine. Then a chocolate Guinness cake which was also incredible. A very creative menu also. Worth the wait on a Sunday morning! Amazing brunch - lots of veggie options. Rayu with avocado was delicious, full of flavour. And those hash browns are perfect! Coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice is a must. Can t wait to come back. A real gem! Vegetarian options: So much choice! My go to place for sunny days, atmosphere is very relaxing and chill. We ordered Agocado Rayu and Eggs&Green, the first was a bit too oily and the second a bit too piquant, but both dishes were on the level! Charming Cafe with Room for Improvement My visit to sample the highly recommended pancakes was met with anticipation, perhaps too high of one. While the pancakes were delicious, they didnt quite achieve the level of brilliance I had hoped for. The berry sauce topping, while flavorful, erred on the sweeter side. I must say, though, the cream was exquisite, but I wished there had been a tad more of it. As a devoted connoisseur of pancakes and French toast, I hold every dining experience to high standards, and these expectations can be demanding. On a positive note, the coffee here was rich and satisfying. The service from the staff was a shining star; they were unfailingly courteous and attentive, even when the place was bustling with people. One small downside is the cafes size. They do offer outdoor seating with umbrellas, but Dublins unpredictable weather means its often off-limits due to rain and wind. This cafe is a cozy spot with potential for even more greatness. The pancakes are good, and a slight tweak to the berry sauces sweetness, bigger size and a tad more cream would make them superb. Paired with great coffee and exceptional service, its a place worth returning to, with hopes of witnessing it achieve its full potential. Our food was lovely although my spiced Irish sausage scramble wasnt hot by the time it made its way to me (cafe was packed). My husband thoroughly enjoyed his pancakes. The cafe is very small so it was quite loud and cramped. Probably one of the best cafes I ve ever been to. The great experience already started whilst waiting in the queue. As we had not reserved but made it on the waiting list, we were served with some small tasters that were so delicious and made appetite for more. The atmosphere inside is super cozy and the staff is just outstanding. We ordered 4 dishes from the lovely and creative menu as we couldn t decide and they all were amazing. For a moment we couldn t speak, just enjoying all different flavors in our mouths   The pancakes are simply incredible, all savory dishes spiced up with flavors we have never tasted. Really a wonderful experience! wow the food was very great! coffee also so good - especially if the weather is nice, such a lovely place !! Food here was okayish. Pea & Avacado Rayu was just edible. I thought ingredients didnt go with each other to create a good taste. Also, it was very oily. Their Hash Browns tasted very bad. They smelled like raw fish that was gone bad. I couldnt eat 2nd bite of Hash Brown. Cappuccino and Brownie were the only things that I felt were good. Brownie sponge was soft, and the chocolate flavor was appropriate. Super warm welcome & kind + fast service. Awesome spot for Brunch. Might be a waiting list but definitely worth it. We had eggs & pancakes with coffee. The menu is great for all dietary needs. Very good place, award-winning for 10 years in a row, and deservingly so! Vegetarian options: There are vegetarian and vegan options! Dietary restrictions: Unfortunately I don t think they have Halal options Kid-friendliness: Kid-friendly Cute cafe with outdoor seating too. Cosy in the inside and also dog friendly. The picture you see is the Rayu. Also had a flat white which was delicious. Staff super friendly too. Thanks Slice team What a gorgeous place to sit and eat great food and delicious coffee in the heart of Stoneybatter! We were warmly welcomed by friendly staff, including my dog.  (They even provided me with a lead for him!) We enjoyed a wonderful lunch in the sunshine, and rounded it off with a delicious cocktail. Well definitely be back. Food was delicious. The pancakes were sweet and fluffy, best i have had in a long time. Staff was friendly. Food came relatively quickly. Place is nice and cosy, though a bit small. Downside was, from where we were sitting, we could see under the coffee machine and it looked like it hadnt been cleaned in a while which was a bit off-putting and worrying. Decided to head to Slice for brunch. Although a bit of a queue, it was worth it. Such a vibrant atmosphere inside, friendly staff and the food was really good. The hash-brown was definitely a winner. Bit of a wait on the weekend but thats to be expected. Staff was very nice (and took allergies seriously) and the food was very tasty, but I was surprised with the disparity of prices on their website vs in person. Hash browns online are 12.50 including bacon, and in person they were 13.50 plus 2.90 for bacon. Please update the website! Best breakfast place Ive visited in Dublin! The food was so delicious and arrived pretty quickly!Make sure to come in time, cause this place was stacked when we arrived. Your name gets put on a waiting list and whenever a table is free you can sit and enjoy the atmosphere and lovely food. 10/10 would go there again :) Small buzzy cafe, great for a weekend brunch. Really unique menu for Dublin that s not a cut and paste of every other spot and  that s executed well. The hash brownies are legendary would definitely recommend them, scrambled eggs - perfect. Excellent coffee. My usual gripe applies of not being able to book a table, so if you go at the weekend expect a 20+ minute wait with a coffee in hand (acceptable for the quality of the food). Stopped by for brunch and sat outside with our puppy, and baby in the pram. Comfortable bench seating and lucky enough to get the late morning sun too! The food is delightful. I had the ham toastie and Herself had the Sausie Scramble. Also had their freshly made pineapple, Orange & ginger juice. Really lovely for overall. The server kindly brought water for our pup. Best toasty Ive ever had! Staff went the extra mile to make our baby girl feel welcome, extremely friendly, great work Food The coffee was good, the homemade lemonade was fresh and tasty and the food was delicious. The coffee-shop is small and nothing extra in terms of decoration but, nevertheless, it feels warm and cozy. Brunch was nice, nothing was excellent for me to want to come back though. Also its very cramped inside, verging on uncomfortable. Food I recently had the pleasure of dining at Slice Restaurant in Dublin, and I must say, my visit left me thoroughly impressed. Despite a slight wait of around 25-30 minutes due to the Sunday crowd, the experience that followed was well worth it. From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance and warmth of the restaurant were apparent. The staff were friendly and accommodating, helping to ease the wait time and setting the tone for a pleasant experience. Once seated, I was promptly handed the menu, and my eyes were drawn to the tantalizing array of options. After careful consideration, I decided to indulge in a variety of dishes that caught my attention. The Brunch Hash Brownies intrigued me, and I couldnt resist the urge to try Naniji s Achaar as well. To complete my meal, I ordered a cappuccino and the Buttermilk Pancake. As I awaited my order, the anticipation grew, and I couldnt help but notice the attention to detail in the restaurants decor. When the food arrived, I was taken aback by the impeccable presentation. Each dish was a work of art, beautifully arranged on the plate. The Brunch Hash Brownies were a delightful blend of flavors, and Naniji s Achaar added a tangy twist that was truly unique. The cappuccino was expertly crafted, providing a perfect balance of bold coffee flavor and velvety milk. However, the star of the show had to be the Buttermilk Pancake. It was a culinary masterpiece, fluffy and golden-brown, topped with a generous drizzle of syrup. Each bite was a harmonious blend of sweetness and texture, leaving me craving for more. The overall experience at Slice Restaurant was nothing short of satisfying. The wait, though initially daunting, was rewarded with a meal that exceeded my expectations. The attention to detail in both the food presentation and the restaurants ambiance showcased the dedication of the staff to provide a memorable dining experience. In conclusion, my visit to Slice Restaurant was a delightful journey for the senses. The delectable food, warm ambiance, and attentive staff combined to create an experience that left me content and eager to return. If youre looking for a place that offers both a feast for the palate and a feast for the eyes, Slice Restaurant in Dublin is undoubtedly worth a visit. An excellent place for breakfast for Breakfast and brunch. The staff were very friendly and the place is fully packed. People sometimes wait in line for the food. We had the Egg & Greens and Buttermilk pancakes. It was delicious and we recommend the Matcha Latte too. Always the most amazing food! Had a private dining experience for family,food was outstanding and the staff were so accommodating, so chilled. Couldnt recommend more. We had a good experience with the service and the environment, despite being busy, it is organized. The flavor of the brunch was wonderful and the cake and pie that we took home were very tasty and fresh. Went here on a rainy morning and was greeted with a warm smile. I initially wanted to order the beef banh mi but they were all out of beef so I ordered the pea and Avocado rayu and a coconut chai latte. The rayu was absolutely delicious with a decent portion size and some really nice feta cheese on top which added a great touch to the dish. Overall, there was a really good balance of flavours. The chai latte was also incredibly sweet and welcoming. I ordered some mulled wine as well which was a tad bitter. The cafe has great energy and is mostly visited by the locals who come there for their morning tea and breakfast. If I could give 10 stars how great this place is for a brunch it would have 10 stars. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was beautiful. We didnt have to wait for too long to get our food. Its a nice cafe family based and they serve nothing but best organic and hand made food. I definitely recommend this place. Definitely reserve in advance cause the place is tiny, but would absolutely recommend for brunch. The granola pot is small so would suggest only if peckish, but so nice regardless. Savory brunch options looked gorgeous. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Obviously we came at a busy time but staff kept seating people even when the kitchen could not keep up with the numbers. Waited 20 minutes for a coffee and 40 for food. Food was tasty enough but portions were ridiculously small considering the prices. I honestly couldnt recommend Slice and dont see myself going back. a great place to have an amazing brunch on weekends. high quality food and excellent coffee. the space is small, however, on sunny days there are tables outside which are very popular. there was a small queue when I arrived with my husband, but we didnt wait for long. I recommend slice for a delicious brunch. Finally got to try here last sat! The food and coffee were incredible! I had the eggs and Green dish and all the flavours were so well balanced and tasty! We were so well looked after especially by the lovely guy with black curly hair! Cant wait to come back again soon! They also have a lovely outdoor area! Lovely! The wait staff was kind and speedy. Very organized. The food was Amazing! The scramble was an explosion of flavor. The cheese toastie was divine. Well be back! Clearly a lovely spot but omg trying to do the basics like order and pay or even check what is on the menu is impossible because theyve left no space to move near the counter. I had wanted to buy a cake as a treat but couldnt check what cakes were there or what prices they were, I could hardly hear the staff and it was far too stressful to figure out what to do. If you want to be a sit down restaurant, be that. Staff are wonderful though. Easily the best brunch I ve ever had and amazing value for money. An absolute must go in Dublin! I came here 2 years ago and had a great time. Made sure to remember  this place for next time I came to Dublin. I Just went for breakfast this morning, honestly amazing food and coffee again. Honestly one of my favourite cafes ever. Looking forward to my next time back. Went for breakfast, had avocado, sausage, egg on sourdough - delicioussss! Lovely fresh orange juice and great coffee, highly recommend. Very accommodating of our 2 small boys as well and great tunes too. Great brunch place, food was excellent - we had the pancakes and spiced sausage with toast. There is a bit of a wait to get in but totally worth it. They are also dog friendly and might let you skip the line if you have a cute pup ;) The place is nice but too loud to call it cozy. The staff is friendly and helpful. I got eggs and greens and I think the combination is poor. Cant say Im a fan of mushy greens or peas in my guacamole."
156,Salt Cellar Cafe,4.6,"Absolutely love this little cafe, staff couldnt be nicer! Food is tasty and orange juice is freshly squeezed and so yummy!! Love it was early for my maternity appointment and its just around the corner a lovely little place   definitely recommend x To be honest it s horrendous, wouldn t fill the cat at home. Bread goes to dust in your mouth. Pudding felt like an elephants foot. Should ve known better when I seen the whole menu was on a blackboard behind the counter. Sausages pure rubber. Bacon was like the sole of a welly. Good enough spot if you re hungry. Shop is only a 2 minute walk away. Breakfast rolls are deadly in it Have been going to this hidden gem in Dublin 2 for years. Such a personal friendly service, not like in the conveyor belt coffee shops. Ciaran, Angel and Eva are always so welcoming... coffe is fnatastic. Their homemade scones are legendary. Great spot for a breakfast brunch or lunch. A proper old cafe, that stands out on its own! They were SO kind and accommodating with our visit and small (grumpy) children, even though it s not really designed for small children (there aren t high chairs). The service was quick and it was one of the best breakfasts we had in all of Ireland (if not the best). We would recommend them to everyone! Thanks for making our visit pleasant and being so kind to our Littles! Happened upon this place during my lunchtime walk and popped in for a quick bite. So glad I did. The chicken noodle soup was wonderful, made me nostalgic for my dad s chicken soup I ate as a child. Will most certainly be returning. Wonderful coffee, eggs and bacon for breakfast here. Perfect spot around the corner from the maternity hospital to go to before visiting hours in the morning. Open at 7am, family run father and daughter, had good chats before I left, will certainly return! Furniture makes you feel like you re back at home too! A very special place! Warm, relaxing atmosphere; 12 of use had a lovely long breakfast here, the staff were so friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious As our accommodation didnt offer breakfast we came here and were not disappointed. Had a great meal for a reasonable price in a very cozy space. Loved the toasted sandwiches. The american coffee was exactly how I like it. My wife had the poached eggs with avocado and tea. We can recommend all the above. As an added bonus, the funny little poem on the restroom door really made my day. :-) The most gorgoeus gem of a cafe on mount street upper. Food and coffee is wonderful made even more memorable by the lovely staff and atmosphere! A gem of a cafe! Beautiful outdoor seating area out the back with plenty of space. Lots of tables inside too. Breakfast was tasty and owners friendly, dog friendly outside I believe. Independent cafes need and appreciate your support! A little gem, discovered by chance during our morning stroll. Everything is there to spend a timeless moment the way we like it. Warm welcome, hearty and hearty food, authentic place. In the basement of a Victorian building. The customers are regulars. Our only regret is not having tasted the homemade soup for which we only read rave reviews. Thank you for this treasure. What a nice find today. Lovely little cafe. Feels like you are stepping into an old farmhouse in the country Food Lovely place for a nice coffee   its quite cozy and quiet, exactly what you need on a rainy day! They have a real fresh orange juice . Very good garden to have a meet and coffee too. Food need little more love   . Keep up guys. Lovely coffee. Nice spot to sit in and have a bite to eat. Great Ham & Cheese Toastie. Staff are friendly. The best chicken noodles soup. And now they have free compost, amazing!! Cosy little cafe. Always busy. You have to try the vegetable soup if your here for lunch best Ive ever tried. Been here a few times now, as always will be returning It is a very cute place. I wish they had longer hours tho, I wanted to stay more. They are a boutique place and the atmosphere is really nice. Loved it. Vegetarian options: They made a vegan sandwich for me, it was delicious. Ciaran and the staff are legends. 8.50  for a sandwich and the best chicken noodle soup you ll ever have, bargain.  It also has the coolest signature collection this side of the Atlantic! Perfect spot for sit in or takeaway. Probably Dublin 2s best kept secret. Everything from avocado on toast to fabulously old fashioned brown scones. Excellent value and quality. This lovely cafe serves delicious food, on unique dishes, with a most friendly and relaxed disposition. Seating inside and out. It has become our favorite cafe, a must visit when were in Dublin! Very good coffee and the best scone Ive ever had. Great experience!! I will go again Lovely basement restaurant for brunch. I adore the Salt Cellar. Been going there for years. Kieron and Angel are the friendliest people and run a great cafe. My favourite is their chicken noodle soup or delicious poached eggs and avocado on sour dough toast. Would give ten stars if I could! Excellent food & friendly service. I was so pleased I read the reviews as lived up to expectations and will certainly be back for breakfast before we end our visit to Dublin. Warm and friendly and the food is always fresh and tasty. Great selection of ingredients for take away sandwiches and the daily specials are usually very good value and excellent quality. This is a hidden gem! Great toasted sandwiches, soups, omelets and of course coffee. Staff are really friendly and efficient. Amazing atmosphere and very friendly staff 5/5 starts all day Loved the experience... Good food... Good service... shared tables... unexpected but good.. very popular with locals Lovely little cafe with homemade soups and free range eggs. Great value and long may they last! Always a nice visit, good food made with care, not rushed out of your seats and you pay when you leave so not to feel rushed, nice atmosphere also very relaxing and rustic Best chicken soup in town! Best staff and best boss ever! I love you Kieran! Great food, good value, nice staff. No frills and a little gem. Great cafe, friendly staff, fast service .. I love the toasted sandwiches and soup . Great coffee, and Ciaran always makes you feel welcome. Also does a great bacon sambo! Uswd to be a regular here. And the sandwiches were great.  Got the toasted special yesterday and was very let down. Good soups, always 3 to chose from, place mainly for local workers , has own high standard!"
157,Shoe Lane Coffee,4.675,"First coffee shop I visited after arriving in Dublin. The coffee was so amazing!! The staff were very kind and friendly!! I liked the atmosphere here as well. (It would have been better if there was a light sandwich or something like mild bread :)) ) A small cosy coffee shpp just beside the Tara Street DART Station. They serve very good matcha latte which the Mrs really like. She is a matcha addict. Quite expensive but I suppose that would be the standard price to get a cup of coffee around Dublin these days. Welcoming atmosphere and staff. Would highly recommend  this little coffee shop. You smell the coffee once you step in and its pure coffee Nice service , vintage atmosphere , excellent coffee They have a space upstairs as well Recommended Food : 5/5 | Shoe Lane Coffee is a convenient stop for a quick coffee, but it s a little pricey and the cappuccinos are average. I ordered an 8 oz (medium) cappuccino, it did the job and it wasn t bad but it wasn t anything to write home about. I felt it was a bit small for the price. The service was quick and the line of customers moved fast. There was a steady stream of people in and out of the shop. Seating is limited, so finding a table at a busy time might be tricky. I believe they offered pastries. I probably wouldn t indulge and would instead find a bakery nearby. All in all, a solid experience, but not the best cappuccino in Dublin. Who cares though not every coffee can be the best, and this cup certainly wasn t the worst. If you re on a budget, I would go somewhere cheaper because the experience will be about the same. Decent coffee and deserts. Staff is very nice. I recommend this place as a take away spot. This cafe is very cosy and cute, the drinks are a reasonable price and there is more seating upstairs. The staff are really polite and friendly and the atmosphere is lively and calm at the same time. The tables are clean and there s books and water taps that are offered.Very good vibes here and I m glad I went. I had an ice tea,it wasn t very sweet but cheap in my opinion ( 3.50). My favourite part is the bathroom! It is so cool as the walls are covered in comics :) good coffee and service but this sign really bummed me out. The loss of third spaces in dublin is disappointing. Will not be a customer at a shop that values their customers this little. Very passive aggressive Good coffee shop that opens SUPER early and closes late, even on weekends. WiFi is available and there s extra seating upstairs if you want to get some work done (there s also a co-working space in the Tara Building next door if you need something more permanent). Coffee and pastries very tasty and the interior is nice. They also sell beans, coffee making tools and accessories. Only minor drawbacks are that the music can be a bit loud, there s limited space upstairs during busy times, and the gingerbread (?) hot cocoa was way too sweet - but that s a personal preference :) This place has become a morning haunt. Coffee is amazing. Staff excellent and friendly. Cakes and bits as you d expect - delicious. If you re in the area of Westmoreland/Tara Street this is your coffee destination. Good quality of coffee and have lots choices of pastries! Staffs are always friendly and helpful , definitely my favorite place in Dublin to work on my laptop or just chilled, the space provide a cozy atmosphere upstairs. Im updating my review. This use to be my absolute favourite place for coffee in the world, not anymore. What happen to Shoe Lane? This place used to be an absolute gem, not anymore. Service has done down in the last few months. Its been twice that chocolate has been put on my cappuccino without asking me first if I want to. The most delightful tunes were always on, best selection of music, not anymore, no music playing most of the time. What happened to the cups on display in a visible place to see the size of the coffee that I wanted to order? They are kind of hidden now. If the toilets are not in use, it would be nice to put a sign on the door informing customers before hand, its common sense. I ordered the coffee just to find out afterwards that toilets are not in use. I was there twice a week, every week. Not anymore. The coffee is still wonderful but I dont go there that much anymore. Coffees tastes great. Perfect pit stop when youre on the way. Amazing stuff! After coffee going wrong direction when I spilled it and after fixing myself upstairs, I came down to find the amazing lady in blue hair had prepared another one. Although I insisted to pay she insisted more that it s on the house. Aside from that my oat mocha was really nice. Thank you! In my opinion, the best coffee in Dublin by far. And then on top of that, you also get the friendliest people that serve you. Always a smile on their faces, it is always a pleasure popping into Shoe Lane for a coffee! Best coffee in Dublin in my opinion, especially the Mochas. It s seriously tempting having this place around the corner from work as I stop by atleast once a week! Lovely staff and delicious coffee Went for lattes (and scones/croissants) every morning I was in town. Other reviewers complained about the small size but honestly the 6 and 8 oz portions were really solid for someone like myself who wants more espresso flavor than milk. The quality of coffee is good! However, I would recommend adding more blends for choosing while ordering. Brazil one is fine but it is pretty common What a fantastic speciality coffee shop in the centre of Dublin. We were in town for a brief visit and wanted a good coffee so decided to try here and we were not disappointed! A couple of excellent flat whites, a delicious cinnamon pastry and a satisfying slice of banana bread. Highly recommend, and well be back the next time were in Dublin! handy out spot outside my bus stop, best mochas in Dublin by far, the chocolate they use is so lush. Staff is always great too great bunch! love coming here with my girlfriend I couldnt recommend this place more! The staff is always friendly, the coffee and pastries are always delicious and the upstairs seating is one of my favourite places to catch a break or get a bit of work done. Good coffee and passable pastries at this place to perch near the river. Gets a bonus point for being the only comparable place open before 09:00 on a Saturday. Cosy cafe with friendly staffs! The matcha latte was great and it has a great environment for simply a coffee-time with your friend or to do do some work! Perfect espresso, open earlier and later in comparison to other independent coffee shops in Dublin. Very friendly staff and there is outdoor seating as well as upstairs seating. came in for a takeaway coffee a few weeks back after landing in from cork, felt horrible as i didn t realise it was literally 3 minutes before they closed until i d walked up to the till. they let me order though, and the coffee was really lovely, i got an oat flat white as usual. hopefully will get to stop by again at a more reasonable hour, i still feel pretty guilty update: came for a second visit today to sit-in and had a lovely chai latte, really well textured milk :) the upstairs seating area is really pleasant when not too busy, i d check it out if you ve the time Very good Espresso, nice location, friedly stuff Great coffee, well priced, lovely place to sit I had such a lovely time while I was at shoe Lane! Evie the barista at the time was so kind, helpful and made us feel at home! Highly recommend this place for their friendly staff and exceptional service! One of the best places I ve ever been felt so nice and quiet. Highly recommended for coffee and croissants lovers! Opens early so great for early risers. Small but cozy. My almond croissant was stale. But otherwise great spot. You may have the Marzocco machine, have a couple single origin coffeee and mocca mokas for sale, or have the oh-so-cool dark interior. But what also makes a good speciality cafe is consistency. Shoe Lane failed in this respect. I obtained this coffee (photo) as my latte - too hot, wrong viscosity and latte art. Was the barista  having an off moment yesterday lunchtime? Maybe. But this shouldnt happen. It wasnt even busy. When a customer pays  4, they expect a great cup of coffee everytime. Wonderful spot. Fantastic coffee, very friendly staff, great atmosphere. Pretty small (only a few seats) but that s part of the atmosphere, I guess, and that s certainly not a problem if you re only staying a short while Freshly roasted coffee We stoped by chance after a morning run and found the best coffee we had in Dublin so far. The milk was burned in the frothing process but still a good latte. The service was great! Very friendly staff Upstairs they had a nice cozy room and what I  very much appreciated: free tap water to help yourself. Always a good fit with coffee to keep one hydrated! The BEST COOKIES in Dublin, I was struggling to find a good coffee in Dublin I m used to V60 in my country, finally a decent coffee here ! You gonna love it Good coffee place, you can take your computer, book or any other thing and go there. Quiet, not noisy, staff is kind and not disturbing you to go away if you stay lon. Which is really good for remote workers who like working in cafes. But please don t abuse it and don t forget to support business. Don t take just 1 coffee and sit 8 hours. It has place in upstairs, inside, outside. Upstairs has a good big table to go with youe friends and enjoy the coffee. Great coffee, gorgeous and tasty pastries and the staff is lovely. The atmosphere is really nice, definitely worth visiting. Excellent place for a great coffee in Dublin City. So happy to find it. Very close to the train station, which made it convenient. Handy location, impeccable coffee, lovely people running the place. Can add your number so when you tap with your phone you collect loyalty points, no card needed. One of my personal Top 5 coffees in Dublin. The first time I visited Dublin, this was the first place I stopped. 2 years later, I remembered it and was happy to find its still there. I had the pear pastry, which was amazing. The coffee was also great. The atmosphere is super cute and cozy. The kind of place you could bring a good book to. Great coffee, went on a weekend afternoon, so was quiet. A really warm, cosy cafe with great coffee and great service reasonably priced great coffee good location and atmosphere Highly recommend if youre in Dublin South and looking for a quiet place to chill ~"
158,Simeng Coffee Bar,4.95,"The food was amazing and the prices were good as well. We had the hot focaccia, pain au chocolat and a hot chocolate. Everything was reaaally good and tasty, one of the best meals that I have had in Dublin in a long time. Welcoming and friendly staff. Quick and pleasant experience getting a delicious chai latte and chocolate croissant here. Seemed like there are usuals and their morning orders are remembered and things are done speedily. The food is amazing!! The cafe is family owned and you can tell because they re so welcoming. We got the breakfast sandwich plus and it was the best sandwich I had. The scrambled eggs were made in the spot and it came with delicious sausage. Very filling! Highly recommend. The Homer is perhaps the best sandwich in Dublin.  Reasonably priced and very friendly.  Good coffee too. The best sandwich I ve had in quite some time at an UNBEATABLE price in the city. We stumbled upon the cafe on our way to the station and were delighted at the lovely proprietors and the most delicious focaccia! After leaving we actually popped back to buy a couple large pieces to take with us on our flight as it was freshly made in house and absolutely divine! Good place for a coffee or chat, quick service with a smile and the owners are lovely people who remember your order. Its nice to have a coffee in a non chain or branded shop. Fantastic! Nice steaming coffee. But over the top- the homemade focaccia sandwich s. Seems local owned and the lady and man made all- not corporate coffee shop- INCREDIBLE! The best value sandwich place in Dublin. Very simple set up but home made ciabatta and Focaccia, both really good and great value. I work near this cafe and go there for lunch sometimes. The food is always tasty and affordable with quick service, and the staff are always very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend for a quick, good quality sandwich. Came here on a solo trip to Dublin, this coffee shop was the first place I visited. Very nice owner, service with a smile. Latte was a fresh as can be and the overall atmosphere was very pleasant. If I ever return, I will stop by again. Great sandwiches  and great people. Toasted focaccia and homer are especially good Stopped in for a quick coffee and was so impressed! The best latte Ive had in ages! Highly recommend checking this place out if youre in Dublin. Nice little cafe with delicious sandwiches and nice owners. Highly recommended. Great food, location and customer service is amazing! Would recommend. Would recommend Simeng to anyone looking for a sandwich in Dublin City Centre. the service is quick and the staff are incredibly friendly! Both the Homer and the Focaccia are as good as it gets! Very nice cafe. The owner is super nice. I m here for a business trip. Very good bagel! This is kind of the place you will go day to day. Only had latte & scone as hot food not available before 8am, but great service, nice coffee. Owner is a friendly whirlwind of activity so fast, attentive service.  Will come again to check out that foccacia! I will always support a small business over a chain. Especially when the coffee, food, value and service are easily better! Im a regular when in the office. Great to have a place that knows your order as your walk in 100% percent recommend. Lovely food, quick and very reasonably priced. Be careful though, a chicken rice dish here will have you sleeping at the desk a couple of hours later! Excellent value, unreal sandwiches, amazing coffee and very friendly staff. 5/5. Need get short break, so I went into first coffee shop in my way. Guy (probably owner) was there alone as staff. Place is small, but he was pretty busy and flying around like mosquito. He was absolutely fantastic, he deserves every single cent and more. Definitely worth to visit and support this. Thanks for nice coffee and warmed muffin. Appreciated! I was on vacation from Seattle Washington, where coffee is truly a culture. This was by far the best cup of coffee I had in ireland. The staff was friendly and worked swiftly. I would go out of my way to return to this shop. I highly recommend! Ordered a cappuccino, was given a very milk intensive latte. This happens with some restaurants but this place identifies as a coffee shop. It also had lots of cocoa dust, which is ok by me but I know a few people that dislike cocoa or are allergic. But .. Nice guy. Efficient. Reasonable. I guess just be very clear about what you want, or do not want, when ordering coffee. In my opinion it s the best place to get a coffee in Dublin, the coffee taste amazing, prices are reasonable and the barista is really friendly and nice. I would definitely recommend! I stop here every morning when I come into Tara Station -- the espresso is the smoothest Ive had in Dublin, the proprietors are lovely, and they have tasty noodles at lunchtime! Unassuming but a real gem. Excellent ! Cheap, balanced, top notch boss! I highly recommend ! Very friendly staff. The price for food and beverages is fair. There are newspapers for you to read and a restroom. Lovely coffee, great value and brilliant service. Very impressed with this little place. Totally recommended I had focaccia here very nice :) I stopped in here on the way to Tara St Station. The flat white was so tasty and the Barista was so friendly. Highly recommend! Great coffee place. I really like the chicken bacon sandwich. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The cajun chicken wrap i had was great, the server was swift and had a good energy. Lovely place :) Best Sandwich in Dublin. Try the Homer +, you wont be disappointed Good Price! Smooth and creamy Flat White! Great Value! No one can miss this cafe in Dublin Great coffee and pastries. Owner is very friendly. Excellent coffee with high attention to detail. Low prices and friendly service. Hard to beat! Stopped here for a quick snack. Food was filling and service was good. Not to expensive for the area. Good prices and extremely friendly service, tasty coffee I just had a soup and it was most delicious.I loved it.food and service 5* Very friendly service, great price & excellent coffee"
159,Social Fabric Cafe,4.825,"Two years living in Stoneybatter and I just visited this place. The food is amazing, generous portions, the Turkish eggs were delicious, the hot chocolate is also a must try. Totally recommended! Must be one of the best breakfast spots in the city. Unique menu, clearly fresh and high quality, portions are generous. Espresso drinks are great as are the friendly staff! What more could you want? The attention of the personal is very good. The food is fantastic and the pancakes are amazing! The flat white, the chocolate   too You should try the carrot cake and the cheese cake ! This place is a must in Dublin. 3.5 / 5 Long queue outside and no option to reserve a table: maybe its over hyped?! Food is tasty, generous portions (e.g. their Irish Breakfast or Eggs Benedict) and fair prices ( 13-14). High quality coffee. Vibe is fun, but acoustics are bad (you have to raise your voice) and at times youll share your table, as in a bench along a large seating area. Service is only so-so: our server rushed that we barely had time to order coffee. Also, they place the cheque at your table after 1 hour(!) without you asking for it. Vegetarian options: Vegan version of Irish Breakfast One of the best breakfast I ever had! Super pleasantly surprised with the quality of the meal. The sausages was to die for and the relish elevates the entire dish. Must visit! An address to remember in Dublin for lovers of ultra quality brunch. Tasty dishes, succulent sauces and refined flavors. Favorite for the avocado egg With added tomato and feta. LA vina vinaigrette is just perfect. The fluffy pancakes you want with beA. On and maple syrup... A treat... Honestly a very good discovery. I almost forgot the excellent value for money This place is amazing - good food, kind staff, great prices, huge quantities. I will come back for sure- the eggs bene and the pancake have my heart very nice and welcoming cafe, kind and efficient service, super good pancakes like the eggs benedict. Highly recommended. ideal for a brunch Great food and great staff! You dont have to wait long for your food. They dont have Coca cola if that is important for you like it was for me :) but ok, I survived :) Lovely little cafe, short walk from the Museum stop on the luas. Good choice of items on the menu Would advise that because it is a small enough cafe to avoid peak times if possible, there is a 60 minute limit on tables during these times Dietary restrictions: Gluten free bread is available This was some of the BEST breakfast food I have ever experienced. I dont even know what to recommend first! The pancakes were delicious, the chicken with poached eggs (I dont remember the name) was so good I had it twice. The Turkish eggs were beyond amazing. I wish we had this restaurant back home. Love love love! Everything is great, the breakfast is delicious, the tea too. Served with a smile. Very pleasant !!!! And the playlist Thank you for this moment nice food in a cozy cafe that s bustling. expect a small queue on a weekend but it s efficient. Turkish eggs were spiced nicely and yummy but left me still slightly hungry. Looks beautiful tastes beautiful   every time need to wait in the queue could not stop me to go there lol and the staffs are super nice as well! Amazing service and even better food, thank you for being a lovely part of our visit in Dublin. Great place for breakfast. The staff are really nice and welcoming. The food sizes are huge and tastes amazing! Absolutely incredible. The food is so good and the staff is lovely! The vegetarian breakfast was so delicious and filling, and the pancakes are just to die for! Loved the smoothies too! Very reasonably priced as well. Definitely recommend and will come back Awesome! Perfect for a brunch. The Turkish Eggs is a must to try, totally recommended. Also, nice and gentle staffe, a 10. Very good ! We had brunch with my boyfriend there, and we really liked it! The service is great, the dishes are plentiful and good! We had the pancakes, the Egg Bene, and Buffalo chicken hash. Hot chocolate and chai latte. The restaurant is beautiful. Very good value for money I recommend 200% if you are passing through Dublin! The flavour and taste in each dish were AMAIZING. Personally, I really enjoyed the Turkish eggs its a bomb of tastes and aromas incredible. The girl who took our order was really nice and kind Thanks for the food, Social Fabric Cafe We found this place by accident, and what a lovely one. Great atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, and the food was simply amazing! Never had Turkish eggs before, and they were fantastic! Coffee was also very nice. Gutted I didn t take pictures because I was too busy enjoying the food! The vegetarian Turkish eggs were incredible - one of my favourite brunch meals EVER. Super quick service and impeccable food. Very sad I don t live in Dublin so can t come here all the time! I highly recommend this place especially for brunch! The place is cozy and spacious, they have kind of a modern/sustainable vibe with many hanging lights from the roof which makes an enjoyable Atmosphere. The service also is great, the staff was attentive and caring with us and food service was also quite fast. The food in my opinion was delicious, I had buttermilk pancakes and they were slightly different from average as they had the almond crumble and some kind of soaked pears which brought the usual pancakes to a completely different level, also ingredients were fresh and coffee also was delicious! I will definitely be back and must visit if you are around stoney batter area! We went here for brunch recently for the first time since the pandemic started. It was delicious then and it s just as delicious now.   Anything I ve ever ordered has been great. The prices are reasonable as well, especially considering the amount and quality of food that you get. Definitely worth a visit! I really love the Social Fabric Cafe. The food is very good, the coffee is great, and the service is top notch. I just tried the cheese cake which was good but not great. Thats the only negative point, but just because I didnt want to give a 5 out of 5. I highly recommend for breakfast or for brunch. This place has become my regular brunch option for a reason. The food quality is consistently exceptional, the service is quick and efficient, and the choices are fantastic. But let me tell you, the weeks special? Absolutely tasty. Youve got to try it! Trust me, you wont be disappointed. Vegetarian options: Vegan options available A hidden jem. We always like to go off the beaten track when visiting anywhere and as a result often find places other visitors are less likely to spot. Social Fabric Cafe is exactly one of those jewels. We went out for breakfast and after walking  for 10 or 15 minutes down side streets we made our way inside. It is not a big place, but bright clean, busy, but yet still very welcoming. After being seated our order was taking quite quickly with coffee and tea delivered swiftly. I had a large breakfast and my wife had the Eggs Benedict. Again we didnt have to wait that long, but we were enjoying the buzz of the place, which was filled mainly with local people. The service was fantastic. The food was delicious and it is the best cooked breakfast I have had for a long time. All of the food was locally sourced, brilliantly cooked with amazing flavour. The black pudding was light and tasty and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection! Thank you guys for such a lovely welcome and a fantastic breakfast. You may have to wait to get a seat, but it is well worth the wait. Food is amazing! You have to queue a bit to get a table but it is worth the wait. I really recommend the pancakes, its very tasty. Staff was very welcoming. Food : 5/5 Perfect place for brunch! Lovely and smiling staff. The cuisine is delicious, wide choice, especially plant-based. I recommend 200% I dont leave a review often but this cafe deserves a few words. Beautiful place with super friendly staff and the food is amongst the best in Dublin. Absolute Gem of a spot and pancakes are out of this world. Many thanks Delicious Food!! Just need to wait for seats cause so many people in weekend, but if u can arrive before 10:30am,maybe don t need to wait . Six of us came on a Sunday at 11 a.m. for brunch. Despite the crowd in 10 minutes we were placed. The food was amazing, super well seasoned. The setting is modern and the dishes are really nice. The service is very pleasant and fast. Prices are reasonable. I decided to order the shakshuka and received poached eggs that seemed to have forgotten their runny yolks! When I politely mentioned this to the waitress and asked for a real poached egg, she informed me that is the way the eggs are supposed to be cooked. So I guess their interpretation of poached eggs is boiled eggs. The coffee wasnt exactly mind-blowing, despite their audacious claim of being the best in Dublin. But fear not, the pancakes were there to rescue the day, standing tall as the only heroes in this brunch. Bravo, pancakes! The food is amazing! Veggie breakfast and Buddha bowl were so goooood!   and pancakes, they are unreal! So fluffy and yum! I would highly recommend! Cute little restaraunt we found. Its off the main strip of Dublin about .5mi so still in a convenient location for walking. The food was pretty good and nicely presented as well. The service was okay. One of the wait staff did seem pretty antisocial and acted upset when you asked her for anything (not just us other tables too). However. The food came out quickly and we highly recommend the Chai latte. Had a lovely brunch eating awesome eggs benedict and a super flavoured breakfast burrito. Big portions and kind staff also, special mention for the super nice purple haired girl! They also have amazing cakes and treats but we were too full to try them :( The food, value for money and service (speed and kindness) were great. Packed on a Saturday morning so a bit noisy, to be expected of a small brunch spot. Highly recommend. Ive never seen a more dedicated and hard working staff than here. The food and coffee were incredible. We had savory breakfast but the cakes and pastries on display looked heavenly as Well  The artwork on the walls is beautiful. A perfect breakfast place Went here for beeakfast this morning before heading to the airport and I can easily say, my friend and I went out with a bang! I got the large pancakes with streaky bacon, fried egg, and maply syrup... it was the best pancakes I have ever had! I have had pancakes at restaurants/cafes in Amsterdam, Paris, Liverpool, and other places. This was another level! They were so thick but fluffy! The bacon was cooked perfectly and had so much flavour. The fried egg just added to the overall amazing flavours. The service was very good as well and was such a nice little independent cafe. Couldnt have asked for a better last meal in Dublin. Please ensure you come here if you want a special breakfast! I had such a really great time at the Social Fabric Cafe ! The staff is georgous and super friendly  . Coffee is good, smoothie is home-made and full of nice fruits ! My meal   was amazingly tasty and generous ;)   I ll definitively be back sooner or later ^_^"
160,Soren & Son,4.35,"They have really delicious and tasty coffee. They use quality coffee (El Salvador and Costa Rica). A small and cute shop. Also atmosphere really cozy. Employees are always polite and helpful. I love reading and working here. You should definitely come and try. I prefer the El Salvador beans for coffee I want. They also sell good cakes and cookies. Very nice specialty coffee place. We had great Costa Rica filter and Brie sandwiches and loved those. Great view on the cathedral Atmosphere: very small and constantly packed since its on a main road cant be missed out, Service: very efficient fast pace and on point know what they have in stock especially when you are in a fast pace location things like that can be missed out and they differently  got  extra points on being extra efficient and manage to keep the fast professional service. Food: The brie toastie was fantasticly seasoned everything in it from the onions, The croissant almond filling was fantastic, not too density, and yet not too runny. It would give the crust something more glazy to take out the crust surface dryness, As for the carrots & pistachio mini cake, would give it a bit more pistachio for flavor and grind the carrots a bit more the chunks of carrots were very thick in style you put in salad, the kick of citrus is nice but take out the flavour of pistachio. The cappuccino oat was good texture but flavour wise the oat milk brand a bit different from what I am used too  so coffee beans could blend well with different oat milk. The latte was great texture and flavour. Recommended  and will try in future the rest of baking goods . Will recommend adding more sandwiches or fast-paced food items since this location is constantly busy and will go really well with extra snacks and not just sweet grabs baking goods . If I lived in Dublin, I d be here every day. While my Danish background might be making the appeal of the cafe more biased   it s justified in every aspect! From the cosy and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere, to the friendly service, this cafe not only invited us to a nice and relaxing coffee in the heart of Dublin   but also brewed the best coffee I am yet to find in Dublin! I will without a doubt be returning to the this cafe next time I m in town! Adorable place with great pastries and toasties. The almond croissant was the best Ive ever had! The ham & cheese toastie, sausage, sage & leek roll, morning bun, and caramel brownie were also delicious. The only thing I didnt like was the coffee and I literally could not drink it. Id still go back for the pastries, though! Best damn coffee I had in a long while in Dublin. These guys know the coffee game very well. Recommendation - go for El Salvador brew. Nice ambience and friendly staff welcoming and serving you with a broad smile. 5 stars from me. Great window for people watching! Got a really nice chocolate on ice drink. Presented so well. Coffee cake was a bit dry though. Staff lovely and friendly. Love the minimalistic and cosy atmosphere with nice & friendly staff. You can try some of their vegan lattes. I recommend trying out the lavender latte, its delicious!   Went here a couple of times already. I m a sucker for cute and this place is just that :) Good selection of pastries and a couple toasties to choose from. Nice spot to grab a quick bite to eat in a prime location that is very walkable and near loads of other shopping and dining options. This is a beautiful place to have a nice breakfast :-) They have very good carrots  cake and delicious hot chocolate I love the location, just in front Saint Patrick Church. The place is very light full and the people that work there is nice and friendly:-) Vegetarian options: They have no animal milk options Kid-friendliness: The people working there are very nice Wheelchair accessibility: There is only one step to enter The place is large and comfortable to move in We stayed nearby this little cafe while in town on holiday and walked away satisfied every morning. The sausage rolls and almond croissants are delicious and the staff is friendly. It can get a bit busy and the shop is small but it s worth the wait if you have time. The places beautiful and the food is made with care. I recommend the Beetroot Latte, the things amazing! Nice little cafe in a modern style. The sandwich was really tasty and the coffee great. Been waiting to go to this cute coffee shop. I tried the beetroot latte (reg milk) and walnut coffee cake - beetroot latte was different, not my taste but I genuinely got it for aesthetics so 5/5 for that. Vegan friendly options. Cosy and cute. Very small and straightforward menu Cramped up space near the large window sadly. But the view is fun. Nice staff, places closes strictly by 4pm. The cake wasn t good, too dry, extremely tiny and I didn t enjoy it like I thought I would. But overall I will go back to try the chai and turmeric latte. Fairly reasonable I paid 7 something euros in total. Truly Excellent toasties. Very good coffee and pastries Im told. Nice little find. Food : 5/5 I Love going here! Amazing atmosphere, drinks, food and really nice staff. Their coffee is amazing! They also sell different beans in store and different coffee appliances. Below is their minty blue latte and lavender apple. I have also tried their beetroot latte and I must say that they are all acquired tastes. They also end up being very grainy each time I order it so I would not recommend unless. They are very pretty though. Their food is very filling, the sauce that their breakfast roles come with is zingy and fresh. Their Wicklow toastie is quite nice and would definitely recommend. As a coffee guru, I went to many good coffee shops in Europe and America and made reviews.  Their communication and interest with their customers made me incredibly happy.  A hospitality that we are not accustomed to in the Netherlands.  at the same time, they showed how expert they are in their jobs with the information they gave along with their coffee.  The coconut and pistachio chocolate cake they gave me to try was also delicious. 4.5 / 5 Simply delicious coffee. Great service, clean, pleasant vibe (just the music is meh). They dont have decaf coffee, but I dont hold it against them. I really liked the chai tea! Very good breakfast with very pretty dishes. Very friendly service. The only downside is the noise and the music, which is a little too club for me. Love it! Great coffee, great staff and great snacks. Honestly, can t go wrong with that place. Enjoy your coffee Worst breakfast Ive ever had. I paid 14.70  for 2 croissants, 1 cappuccino and 1 double espresso. The croissants were burnt and you could taste it and the cappuccino and coffee (Costa Rica beans) were acid. Nice view and service, but never again! A wonderful coffee shop/bakery. The baked goods all looked so good. The almond croissant was amazing. Crispy on the outside with the perfect amount of almond filling. So good we went two days in a row! The cappuccino and americano was quite good as well (with a choice of two types of beans). Friendly service and a cute place as well. Delicious and good value for money beetroot latte. Near to St Pat s cathedral so treat yourself after We stopped here for a coffee as we waited for some friends. The location has a nice appearance and delivers special coffee attributes. On the other hand, the chairs are uncomfortable, the service is ineffective and often unkind, and the cost does not correspond to the quality of the product. If youre looking for a great cup of coffee and friendly service, look no further than this new cafe! The coffee here is top-notch - rich, flavorful, and expertly crafted by skilled baristas. But what really sets this place apart is the warm and welcoming atmosphere, thanks to the friendly and attentive staff. Highly recommended! The worst coffee. We stopped coming here last April because it was a hit and a miss on the flat white front. Stopped by again Sunday 3 March and because the girl who was there from when the coffee shop first opened was at the till taking orders and 2 new baristas were making coffee we said we d chance it. Unfortunately the girl took the order and went and made the coffees. I didn t have a mobile on me to take a photo but the coffee was dreadful. My husbands was just passable but mine had a thick layer of foam on top and the milk was so untextured there wasn t even a design on the top because with that milk it would have been impossible. I actually do better ones at home.  Another barista dropped a flat white over to the girl beside me and it looked 5/5 with a dark top and a design.  Id like to say it was an off coffee but her coffees are always like this.  She shouldn t be left near the coffee machine! Sausage rolls are fab. Pretty awful experience. We went in to try the Acai bowls as we never had them before and this place was supposed to be a good spot for them. Upon taking our order a member of staff told us they had no toppings for them and proceeded to charge us full price for them regardless. We paid 24 euro for 2 cups of coffee and 2 bowls.My partner got a lavender latte which was gritty and bland. I had a flat white which tasted like it had no coffee in it. The acai bowls came as just a smoothie in a bowl with nothing on them. The dragon fruit one was like soup it was so watery. I have worked at restaurants before and if you don t have the ingredients for a dish you don t serve it. Say it s out of stock, not charge full price for something that s incomplete. Went the other day to grab some sausage rolls and coffee. Ordered a drip coffee to go and waited 15-20 min for it. Went back again to give it another shot. Hard to see from the photo but there was so much Dijon mustard on it it made it borderline inedible. I was literally sweating. My fiance said the same about his. There was another couple next to us who had the same thing and we saw her take the sandwich apart and scrape off the mustard. It was the ham and cheese toasty. Not sure if it was a one time error or not but it wasn t great. Food I absolutely love this place. Ive been back here for the 7th time already! Amazing coffee and pastries. My favourites are the cruffins and almond croissant. Get them to heat it up for you and you will be transported to heaven. They do change their cruffin flavours from time to time. So far Ive had coffee cream filling cruffin and the praline cream cruffin. Both were amazing. My friends love their hot chocolate.  The presentation is lovely and aesthetically pleasing. I am very impressed with they way they present the drinks.  It is served on a beautiful cup on a wooden plate (i dont know if it is called a plate but look at the pictures) This is only if you sit in the cafe. If youre taking away obviously it will be in a paper cup. I think the filter coffee needs improvement. It was way too diluted for a filter coffee. I bought a MIIR tumbler from them too. Its good quality. I usually make tea with it and I pour boiling water into the tumbler. The cup feels absolutely cool to touch. Keeps relatively warm for at least 2 hours. I didnt bother to experiment it further. The lady at the counter said I could get a discount on coffee if I bring my soren and son MIIR tumbler in the next time. I hope I will get Overall thank you for opening this beautiful cafe and keep up the good work   thanks for making living abroad for me a little happier and comforting. P.s. i try to be friendly but somehow it makes me a lil sad that they dont recognise me eventhough Ive been back here so many times. I ordered a morning bun and flat white, all good for me. They are nice and friendly, will come back and try filter next time. I had a Cortado and almond croissant , the coffee was good but the almond croissant was old and at least 2 or 3 days old .the croissants are not fresh after 12 hours I am so happy that this shop opened in this neighborhood because it needed this! You get a choice of which coffee roast you want with any of the coffee drinks, and Ive enjoyed both. My brother says their hot chocolate is better than Butlers!! It has the most beautiful tables and shares as well as cups and silverware. It is so aesthetically pleasing with a very neighborhood coffee shop feel. I would just say that the staff could be friendlier. This place is just amazing and has the best coffee in town! Its super cozy, the staff is really nice, especially the manager Mariana! Thank you for the excellent experience, we are definitely coming back! A very nice, pleasant and cozy cafe. they have a choice of different types of coffee and pastries. They have excellent coffee here. The service is also very pleasant. Chill environment. Zen. Great coffee. Speciality coffee the way I absolutely love. Forget about other comercial coffee shops where, by example, americano and filter coffee are the same. They will ask you to choose between two origins (my choice is Costa Rica for americano). Filter coffee is pour over, not Moccamaster (not a problem for me, I love both).  You can have a full breakfast too, cakes look really yummy. To make it even better, you can enjoy the coffee with a wonderful view to St. Patricks cathedral. They also have some coffeware and merchandise like hoodies. Perfect little space for a great breakfast and a cuppa of freshly brewed coffee   ... Excellent coffee and pastries! Was busy both times we went, but the line moved quickly. I went to try their beetroot latte and it was so good. It s definitely a must try. Love this cafe. Want to try more"
161,St Patrick's Cathedral,4.725,"Highly recommend not only to catholics but to all. Beautiful architecture, stained glass, old relics &  flags. Hands on area for charcoal rubbings and sensory area to hands on the stone, embroidery and tiles. So much incredible history. Our family has an ancestor buried there which made it quite special. Easy to find, walkable, guided tours or self guided with head sets. Staff was helpful and friendly. Cute gift shop as well. founded in 1191, St. Patrick s Church in Dublin is a beautiful example of Gothic Revival architecture and one of the few buildings left from the medieval city of Dublin. The stunning stained glass windows cast constant rainbow colors across the pews. It s a beautiful cathedral and worth the quick audio guided visit. She started Catholic but ended up Anglican during the reformation and remains as such. Jonathan Swift is buried here. Wow! Wow! I can I live here please? This place is so magical.  Very well done, worth every euro. Breathtaking....I believe I spent over 2 hours here . There are bathroom facilities, lockers for your personal items. Booklet to tell you about each magnificent piece of artwork etc. The photos do not do this castle justice. Its much better in person. When I think Irish cathedral, this is it. Very beautiful to explore and has a great audio guide to explain the vast history. It does cost 10 euros as an adult to get in, if your not used to paying to visit churches. I am so glad we were able to visit this gorgeous and ethereal Cathedral while visiting Dublin, Ireland! It is absolutely breath-taking, and has so much history. Our tour guide showed us some very exciting parts of the Cathedral like the statue of St. Patrick in his baptizing position, the door where the term changing his arm comes from, the spot where the President of Ireland sits for service, and many more historic spots. This Cathedral is rich with history and Irish heritage, and is a perfect place to stop in when visiting Irelands capitol! Although it was crowded, this cathedral is beautiful! The mosaic floor alone is worth seeing. Make sure to visit the free park outside to see the entire cathedral from the outside. St Patricks cathedral is one of the main attractions in Ireland. It speaks of its  Catholic and Anglican heritage. It has many Stain glass windows and chapels. You need to pay for the visit and you wont be disappointed. It was interesting to know that Johnathan swift, the author of Gullivers travels was a dean here and buried at St Patrick Cathedral. The cathedral has various daily services. It also also has various depictions of St Patrick This Gothic building with its thousands of beautiful stained glass windows was especially notable for me on account of it being Jonathan Swifts final resting place. People of my age read his classic  Gullivers Travels as a child, though I didnt know the book was written in 1726. Swift lived till he was 77, quite a feat in those days. And its attributed to his bathing daily and exercising! The self-guided tour provided in multiple languages was wonderful!  We could skip or hear more, rewind and pause to talk amongst ourselves.  The beauty of the place is a little lost in the crowds - we were glad to be there midweek and went back for eucharist on Saturday - it was so packed we could barely hear.  We were grateful for the history and sense of place, as well as the graciousness of the hosts. Beautiful building, but the visit is paid ( 10). I didnt make it. Beside there is St Patricks Park, a beautiful place, bench to sit (where I had my snack), a gorgeous fountain and nice place to take beautiful pictures. Maybe I am missing something - this was just okay. Not something to rave about. I know the significance of this cathedral to the religion, but I didnt find this to be a well done tour or an overly beautiful cathedral. It is 10 euros a person to come in, so not really much of an expense. they offer an audio guide to walk around and get more details on the space. dont get me wrong the stain glass windows and the interior is quite beautiful, but it isnt the most beautiful cathedral I have seen. worth a visit, but might not be my number 1 list item in Dublin unless it was a religious experience. It worths every penny!! They have brochures in all main languages and some, audio guide very good, you can use your ticket during all your stay, they have toilet and a gift shop not that expensive. All people very nice and helpful Visited on 800 years old beautiful gothic cathedral. They provide an audio guide and lots of written information thats useful and very interesting. We spent 1,5 hours there and time ran quickly. The only thing I dislike is that it closes at 5 pm as everything in Dublin. (Only pubs are available). We are ok to pay for the entry because they need lots of money to support this old cathedral and provide amazing experience for the tourists A must-visit place in Dublin. The space is very well preserved and organized. The gardens, which are free to enter, are an attraction in themselves, but I think it is mandatory to enter this beautiful Cathedral. The ticket is a little expensive, but it helps with the conservation of the place. The staff is very friendly. I highly recommend the visit! We went to St. Patrick s Cathedral the weekend of St. Patrick s Day, and we highly recommend purchasing tickets in advance. The inside is very beautiful and ornate. The history and great little nuggets of information about St. Patrick is also interesting. St. Patricks Cathedral in Dublin, Ireland, is a majestic testament to the nations rich spiritual and cultural legacy, steeped in centuries of history, tradition, and significance. Its origins trace back to the late 12th century when Archbishop John Comyn established it as a place of worship on the site of an earlier church, believed to have been founded by St. Patrick himself. Over the centuries, the cathedral has undergone numerous renovations and expansions, evolving into the awe-inspiring architectural marvel that it is today. The cathedrals exterior is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture, characterized by its soaring spires, elegant buttresses, and intricate stonework. The imposing west facade, adorned with elaborate sculptures and decorative details, serves as a striking symbol of faith and devotion. As visitors enter through the grandiose doors, they are greeted by the awe-inspiring interior, illuminated by the soft glow of stained glass windows that depict biblical scenes, saints, and martyrs. One of the most revered features of St. Patricks Cathedral is the tomb of Jonathan Swift, the renowned satirist and former Dean of the cathedral. Swifts tomb, located in the south aisle, is a masterpiece of funerary artistry, adorned with a larger-than-life effigy of the writer in contemplative repose. It stands as a testament to Swifts literary genius and his enduring legacy in Irish literature. Beyond its architectural splendor and artistic treasures, St. Patricks Cathedral serves as a vibrant center of spiritual life and cultural activity in Dublin. It hosts regular religious services, concerts, lectures, and exhibitions, welcoming visitors from around the world to experience the beauty, history, and spirituality of this sacred place. St. Patricks Cathedral holds a special place in the hearts of the Irish people, serving as a symbol of their faith, resilience, and cultural identity. It stands as a beacon of hope and inspiration, inviting all who enter its hallowed halls to pause, reflect, and find solace in its timeless beauty and grace. I loved This cathedral is splendid, I felt so good there, I carefully took the time to visit it from all angles. Finally, we find magnificent objects in the souvenir shop Impressive old architecture and vitrages.  Old grave-stones and memorials. You can leave there a memory about you loved in a big tree of remember. Audio- guide available.  Some nice things to buy in gift-shop. The tickets easy to buy in internet, if you use app fever- you can get a discount. Free audio guide available at the entrance (or by scanning a QR code with your phone) Very detailed tour to learn more about the history of this cathedral, possibility of listening to songs and making a drawing to take away, which is quite unique! Very beautiful cathedral and very beautiful park Audio guides are included in the entrance ticket and are very complete on the visit with interesting anecdotes There is a discovery area where you can discover the cathedral in a fun way with all kinds of interactive activities An iconic church to visit in Dublin. Entrance costs 10 euros each. We enjoyed the park adjacent to the church which has plenty of benches and soft grass to sit on and relax. It seems to be a popular lunch spot for locals. WOW - really beautiful. Worth a visit. And walking distance from ChristChurch so you can visit 2 in one day - be aware of open times so you dont come when they are closed. An extreme disappointment. I have seen churches selling things but St Patricks goes so far as to sell even Guinness merch. St Patrick would probably need a lot of Guinness to endure this commericalization of the place built in his name. The church is indeed beautiful and has the tombstones of many famous Irish people but with way it is running it doesnt feel like a church. I would have been okay if they put the shops outside the park attached to the church. Reading the history of the church through the reformation and Ireland subsequent history makes me wonder why is the Church of Ireland still in charge of what was once was a sacred cathedral to a commercial spot with so few Irish identifying as members of church of Ireland. Place is amazing. It shows so much history and is very well preserved. Spent about an hour inside touring it, and the gift shop. It s a must if you in the local area of Dublin. Beautiful. History of the cathedral can be explored via support of an audioguide (included in the 10EUR entrance fee). Timewise, I would recommend 1 hour. But this might be more or less, based on the personal interest. Beautiful garden, despite the all day mist it was still beautiful and great place to spend walking around.  Garden is free the Cathedral itself its better to buy tickets online. Beautiful cathedral named in honor of the great saint. If you have a knowledgeable your guide, itll be worth it. Quite an amazing history. Its almost like a military museum once you hear the facts and people who built and donated to it. beautiful cathedral in dublin! i enjoyed visiting and they had so much information about the history of the cathedral which i loved. incredible stained glass and nice gift shop too St. Patricks Cathedral in Dublin is a mesmerizing blend of history and spirituality. Steeped in over eight centuries of legacy, its Gothic architecture enchants visitors with intricate details and soaring spires. The tranquil ambiance invites contemplation, offering a serene escape from bustling Dublin. The ethereal light filtering through stained glass windows adds a celestial touch to the experience. The cathedrals vast interior houses stunning monuments and memorials, preserving Irelands rich cultural heritage. Welcoming staff and informative tours enhance the visit, providing insight into its storied past. A visit to St. Patricks Cathedral is an immersive journey into Irelands soul, a testament to timeless beauty and reverence. So much history!! Author Jonathan Swift was the Dean here for over 30 years and is buried here. See the war memorial area where colors are presented and left to fade away, the oldest from the Crimea. Behold the  Reconciliation door where you can  risk your arm  and the breathtaking architecture. Hop on the guided tour - we had Ellen as our tour guide, a former New Yorker who moved to Ireland years ago.

The interior seems too classic and uninteresting at first glance, but in fact there are a lot of very interesting details there! To have ! St Patricks Cathedral is a beautiful space. The floors are magnificent. with the tile work being very intricate and covering the entire cathedral floor. There are beautiful marble statues decorating many of the tombs. The stained glass windows are magnificent. It is interesting to hear of the story of how the Guinness family renovated the cathedral when it had fallen into disrepair. The crypt is pretty cool. There are some old texts that have been handwritten and are several 100 years old. Theres a great little gift shop and restrooms downstairs. The stainglass windows are fantastic.

The Jameson family renovated Christchurch Cathedral around the same time as the Guinness family was renovating St. Patricks."

It had the doors open so you can go in and enjoy the architechture and the garden very close, the sunset is beutiful from here. Small little cozy park with some musical stones to take a rest in the center of the city. A pretty little bit of green space, with parts dedicated to growth of wild grasses and flowers, which was good to see. Nice little park, do be careful as there are junkies in the park and beside were the coaches park. Very clear and children friendly, however can have a few unsavoury characters.

163,St. Kevin's Park,4.6,"Well tended Park, in Church Ruin and graveyard. Plenty of benches and bins. A popular dog walking destination from what I observe. Unfortunately the adjacent ex-college lands are being burrowed plummeted and pounded by a barrage of augers and excavators, so the peace wont be around till Id guess 2024/5! Worth an exploratory visit. Id expect Sat. or Sun might be a safe quiet bet?!. It also skirts Opium nightclub and a laneway of some great grafitti Lovely, quiet area, great for take a break, when you want to be alone with nature or have a picnic with family or friends Nice little park with an ancient church ruin and tombstones the seventeen hundreds. Its not big, but theres a lovely tree in the midst of it. Visited the park, a part of a ghost (bus) tour. The now park was once a porpers grave yard several hundred years ago mostly full of 28 century plage bodies and some higher ranking church officials, and the shell of a burned our church that our tour guide Vicent explained was where The Duke of Wellington was baptised. Anyway the graves were cleared by the local council and the place turned into quite park. Vincent told us many ghost stores about the place and who grave robbers took bodies with a mini sized coffin and tour volunteers laying in a the demo coffin. The park is well maintained if you need a quite effective moment, but a little out of the way. Its so amazing that so many people from Dublin dont even know about here. Thats probably a good thing. Beautiful place to visit played there as a nipper happy memories . Nice quite small park in middle of city. Lots of historical interest. Perfect spot for some peace and solitude on a busy day. A small and cute park not far from the city center. It is quiet and pretty clean. We visited The Crafty Fox, just off Camden Street, on Thursday evening. It s a lovely well laid out pub, with a good offering of craft beers and food from Opium, which is next door. Food is lovely, but would hugely benefit from even a paper plate being offered. Very difficult to eat from a paper box when everything in it is so hot. All the rice and sauce is underneath, so definitely not a great way to serve something delicious. Pint is top notch and decor is quirky. Noise levels were high and definitely not somewhere for an informative catch up with friends. I d come back again, but at a quieter time, so I could have a good look around and enjoy the ambiance. Park closes about 45 mins before advertised closing time. Lovely park, pity it closes so early. This park is a gem, very calm and sunny. There are several benches surrounded by roses. The ruins of the church gives a romantic touch. Very relaxed atmosphere not like the usual tourist trap. The Old building and graves (around the wall) brings a feeling of how ancient and historical a place it is. Need a place on Camden street to drink your socially distanced coffee or pint and that ISNT Stephens Green? St Kevin s Park provides a tranquil little hide away with a quaint historic twist. Marvel at the gravestones and old chapel. When you re done check out the graffiti down Liberty Lane. This is one of Dublins hidden gems. A small park that you could easily walk past without noticing. Apart from being a nice oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city, it also contains an old graveyard, and the ruins of an old church.  In 1769, the future Duke of Wellington, who went on to defeat Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo, was baptized.. Lovely little (very little) corpo park. Is it the cities smallest park? A mix of tourist, locals, lunch break office workers & (it being Dublin) junkies/alcos. The old church & tombstones are worth the visit Great little park full of history.with so many cafes nearby a good spot for a chill out when the weather is nice. This is a beautiful park even with a massive big building site surrounded it is a great place to go for a walk St Kevin s Park, Camden row, off Wexford Street (back of Whelan s). Probably one of the prettiest parks and best kept secrets in Dublin. In St Kevins park, lies a ruined church, a great Catholic Martyr and some prominent grave stones. This walled parkland is teeming with wildlife and atmosphere. Take a cup of coffee, find a good seat and relax. The ruined church of St Kevin s was built in 1780 and was ruined in early 20th century.  In St Kevins you can view the gravestones, enjoy the wild life and the beautiful shrubbery.  A church has been present on this site since pre-Norman times. Arthur Wellesley, alias Duke of Wellington was baptised here. Among the burials are Sir Thomas Moore s family plot, John Keogh (1740 1817), friend of Wolfe Tone. Hugh Leeson, the brewer, whose family gave its name to Leeson Street. The Lessons were Earls of Milltown and owners of Russborough House, County Wicklow. John DArcy owner of the Anchor brewery is buried here. DArcys funeral led to a huge public acrimonius dispute between Daniel OConnell and the Guinness family. St Kevins Park will be remembered as the secret grave of Tudor Martyr Blessed Archbishop Dermot OHurley. Executed by the Queen Elizabeth Is English Govt in Dublin. OHurley was tortured in boiling pitch, raked, and beaten with iron bars for days. He was dragged through the streets, hastily executed with a rope of thorns on Hoggen Green (College Green) and is secretly buried in St Kevin s. A beautiful exceptional city park. Well worth a visit but some caution is advised as it can attract low level anti-social activity. Small park off camden Street has old headstones around the walls must have been an old graveyard Lovely little park a credit to caretakers well worth a visit Whoever looks after that park is doing a fantastic job its a lil bit of peace and quiet in nonstop city and the 2 lads looking after it should be given pay rises there fantastic Small park full of charm and very pleasant for lunch outside in summer. Really quiet park with an old church, never been used for quite some time. You can sit here and read a book when the weather is nice. Nice small park just off Camden Street to sit in on a nice day lots of history too A lovely small park full of lovely locals and a spot where you can chill Beautiful park and you must visit the grounds of St. Kevins church and read all about the history of the people from that area. Great quiet lil park to retreat to for some quiet time, old and rundown, with the ruin of an old church , I love it and go regurally for quiet chats or solitude Small, quiet, great for a lunch break on the grass. Bring a book. It has lovely flowers and has a good space for a picnic Nice quiet park to go for a quick break from the busy center of town. A Tiny Park is my favorite park any time of the year its peaceful and nice So much history in this park it was a cemetery back in its day  go on a night tour and get the atmosphere of the place and its tragic history behind it Neat stop on the Dublin ghost tour. Unreal to think that was once a church. Interesting to hear the stories from the past. An absolute hidden gem. The lack of the 5th star is because of the junkie problem - in fairness theyre by no means always there and they keep themselves to themselves Its historically important, Duke of Wellington and family used the church. Archbishop of hurley buried  in the church. St. Kevins Church (Irish: Eaglais Naomh Caoimhin), in St. Kevins Park, Camden Row, Dublin, Ireland, is a church dating back at least as far as the 13th century, and was dedicated to Kevin of Glendalough. Nice and quiet, there are benches to sit down and relax A.small park but a quiet lay by fir a short time. Nice quite park in the middle of the city unusual."

A very beautiful park where you feel safe and friendly, sometimes with small stands of Irish artisans where you can buy handmade souvenirs, as well as musical groups.

165,St. Patrick's Tower at The Digital Hub,4.65,"Amazing building built circa 1757. It was the largest smock windmill Europe. Its one of the last remaining buildings of the original George Roe Distillery. Theres a pear tree planted at the base dating back to 1850, and its one of the oldest fruit bearing trees in Ireland. One of the Dublin city most famous symbols and definitely a must see, if you are in Dublin! Cool looking tower! Nothing special but a nice small cafe at the base. I think just the walk to get here is very nice. You pass a lot of churches you night not have initially planned to visit! There is not much to see are there no public access to the interior. For some reason my father always referred to this as the Guinness Malting Tower. However, this structure was not owned by Guinness and in fact it was the largest smock windmill Europe and it was and was built as part of the Roe whiskey distillery in 1757. The Thomas Street Distillery, run by the Roe Family, was once the largest in the Britain and Ireland, with an output of two million gallons per annum at its peak. After the distillery was closed in 1926, some of its buildings were purchased and incorporated into the Guinness Brewery. A few years ago Diageo, the owners of Guinness, resurrected the original brand and launched a non-chill filtered, 45% ABV premium blended whiskey under the name Roe & Co in March 2017. Many historical references are showing that a Sylvester Costigan was the rightful owner of St Patricks Tower. Costigan also owned a distillery on Thomas St that some 2,000 United Irishmen rebels hid in during the 1803 rebellion under Robert Emmet. The same Sylvester Costigan is still buried at St James Church in Dublin which is being converted into a distillery now. Historical evidence shows Costigan was the one who rebuilt the windmill in 1810. Roe dynasty appears to have swindled it from Costigan. I believe history is trying to cover up a theft of property and rightful ownership to the Costigan dynasty. A former Windmill. A landmark that is visible from across the city and can be used as a help in finding the Guinness store house which is just across the street (although the entrance is a bit further). The tower itself is not accessible but is lit-up on holidays in appropriate colours eg green for St Patricks day. There is a coffee shop nearby which has a good coffee. St Patrick s Tower is located on Thomas Street in Dublin City. It was built in 1757 and was the largest smock windmill in Europe used to power the Roe Whiskey Distillery. A smock mill is a type of windmill that consists of a sloping sides that resembled smocks worn by farmers in the Netherlands, where their construction originated. George Roe and Company started their company here in the 1750 s and by 1887 it had expanded into the largest distillery in Europe. At that time the Thomas Street Distillery covered 17 acres and was producing 2 million gallons of whiskey annually. Roe Whiskey was exported to the United States, Canada and Australia as well as to all over Europe. The Row family became so wealthy that they even funded the restoration of Christ Church Cathedral. By the turn of the new century however the whiskey industry went into a global decline. By 1926 the distillery had ceased producing whiskey but held large quantities of unsold stock in storage. In the mid 1940 s the company finally dissolved and in 1949 the next door neighbours, a little unknown company called Guinness bought the entire site! This is now the Digital Hub of Dublin where technology, media and internet companies are encouragedto set up and thrive together in a business community. Very beautiful tower. The alley next door is charming. Beautiful tower. Worth a look. It looks beautiful. St. Patricks Tower D08 As seen from the outside, extremely well preserved building. Lovely little cafe beside here with view of tower. Cool building amazing to think it started life as a wind mill Nice attraction Nice looking tower but nothing special Great location for the Dublin Flea Market! A church with much splendor. Nice area Amazing One of the symbols of Dublin Nice place to stroll Dublin Flea Market location Unfortunately you cannot visit the tower. However, he has a nice story with the Roe & Co Distillery a few meters away. Its definitely worth a visit for the tour. La torre detta di San Patrizio  si   trova in Thomas str. a Dublino fu costruita nel 1757  e  usata  dalla Roe whisky distillery per le proprie attivita. allepoc era lo smock windmill piu grande utilizzato in europa.

169,Taste & See Cafe,4.85,"Love this little hidden cafe. Great coffee coupled with courtesy and great service. Opposite the side of the Four Courts, it is frequented by the legal establishment as a regular haunt. The coffee is smooth and there is a small pastry /lunch menu to complement it. The sign over the door reads Medical Mission, a nod to the building s past use. But enter to the right as you go in and you are within an airy, if slightly small room. Well worth a diversion. Lovely cafe with friendly service, good prices and enjoyable music and lighting :) tea is very tasty! Available wifi. Cold drink and cake options too. Dietary restrictions: Alternative milk options Very comfortabel and nice place. Good service, delicious coffee and food. Lovely taste and affordable coffee for a good cause Simply delicious. Best cappuccino in town! This cafe is run by very welcoming and friendly volunteers with all proceeds going to the community and those who need help the most.

Wonderful coffee, soup and toasties, topped off with a friendly staff. A must Brilliant coffee and even better cakes. Only  4.50 for coffee and a slice Very good coffee and not expensive.

170,"The Ark, Dublin",4.7,"My daughter and I visited the Ark Museum for the first time and we saw the Pinocchio exhibition. It was very well made with several books from different periods and languages and with several objects. Anyone will realize that it is an unforgettable story. To finish the exhibition we have access to the workshop, for me it was the most important part of the exhibition for young children to their grown-ups, any visitor can materialize with collages or drawings what they saw in the exhibition accompanied by a talented coordinator. It was an incredible experience. We cant wait for the next exibition. We attended the making of mollie and it was absolutely brilliant! The 5 actors were amazing and do really brought the story to life! We love the Ark theatre and go to as many shows as we can! Highly recommend visiting if you can every time we(mom with 4kids) visit, i feel very warm kindness from all staffs thanks again. The ark is the best place to visit with kids in Dublin. One of my favourite places ever! Im delighted that someone thought about creating a perfect banter for children. Its like a magical building at the heart of Temple Bar, with an absolutely stunning interior, fantastic staff (theres a particular nice girl, with long and independent hair, whos so nice, that she restors your faith in humanity) and great events. We love their art and musical workshops, was proud to take part in an amazing project called Put yourself in a portrait (2016 & 2019) but what swept us from our feet was Emil and the detectives performance. Never seen anything so engaging and magical in my life! Thank you so much for building fantastic memories! Fantastic place to bring children up to pre-teen age. Currently running an exhibition of board games with chance to play them too! Highly interactive place with patient staff. Its also free entry. Some workshops as well, though very limited capacity requiring booking will in advance. Fantastic show - The making of Molley. Niamh McAllister was brilliant! Great place with very friendly staff and all geared to children! Loved it!! The ark is an amazing project. Built to entertain kids of all ages. Friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommended for families and spending a creative fun day Accomodating, friendly and supportive staff. Accessable space for wheelchair users. Thoughtful and insightful creative and cultural productions. Excellent cultural centre and entertainment venue for kids. Great location in Temple Bar. Loved the concept of The Ark! They have many events throughout the year. Recommended to years 2 to 12. There are some paid events but drop-in events as well. Ive been to this place about several times. I remember I went there for the first time with my school in October 1999 and I was nine in that year. I thought I never visited any places like that before. Its pretty amazing. The staff are very friendly by the way. The first performance I saw was about the chicken and something else but sorry I forget the name. I also remember the rooster turned into a weather vane after being cooked! That was kinda very funny. First time Ive been here. Took the kids to scrapefoot. We didnt go in, but could here all the excitement. The staff were really happy and friendly and great with the kids, who absolutely loved the experience. Cant wait to go to another one. Super price too. Highly recommended. Great activities for kids. The theatre has a awesome selection of shows suitable for smaller and older children. Very cosy and relaxed atmosphere, great for parents too! Went for the Wolfwalker event and loved it. The building and architecture is awesome, will visit again. It s kind of crazy that accompanying adults need to buy tickets for a show specifically aimed at 2-5 year olds. If I was bringing my toddler to rainbow Phil or a music class I d hardly need to buy myself a ticket too! It cost  15 a ticket (45 minute show), so it cost us a whopping  45 (2 parents and a toddler) to attend a 45 minute show. That would be fine if it was a show with *any* focus on adults but it was blatantly for toddlers only. The show itself was fine, I d probably fork out a tenner max for it to keep a 2 year old entertained but wasn t worth  45  I mean that s  1 per minute    The whole thing was so disappointing and cost us so much money for what it was, we actually had a good laugh about it after I like The Ark, I think is an amazing space and I love the concept. Although we were a bit disappointed today. We went to see the Tiny Trad show and we found it a bit too boring and lacked of real interactions with the children. The performers didnt really tailor the show to give kids the opportunity to explore the music, in an interactive way. I really want to like this place because I love the concept and the staff are really helpful and kind.  However currently there is an exhibition for children on in which all the exhibits, bar one, are delicate and not to be touched. I spent my time there trying to rein kids in, instead of allowing them to explore. Nothing is interactive, apart from the donation box. Not for the first  time,  I thought about how this place fails to serve the cohort it is supposed to. Brought my 3 year old to the 2-4 year old events over the summer! Had the best time! Highly recommend the early years workshops We attended a workshop where children designed a poster based on the rights that were most important to them. The artists were very helpful and the atmosphere was lovely A brilliant theatre , modern and very inclusive staff are amazing would definitely recommend a visit I really enjoyed it here. Spent 2 hours drawing and colouring with my daughter. Hadnt done any art in 30 years. Saw their show The Haircut last Wednesday and LOVED it. Place is clean and accessible and the staff were lovely and patient. The show itself was really special. A vocal storytelling with musical background effects. Sort of like the folly studios for older movies. Great stuff! Unbelievable . Went there with the lads great Craic poured pints into the pool (sorry) sang rock chants all night long had a race to end of the pool Lovely staff, lovely - yet small - exhibition and on top of that workshop where you and your child can play and make some art. Love it! Plus, no entry fee! Love it, will be back! Great exhibition for the family and with the opportunity to play board games yourself you could spend a few hours here. My Son did the Me & the City workshop on Monday 19th of March and he absolutely loved it. The teachers and Artist were fabulous and so encouraging. I would highly recommend attending a workshop if your child has any interest in building and creating. Thank you to all at the ark, we will be back. Always a favourite of mine - ive been bringing the kids to their unique events for years. A beautiful blend of play, art, music, drama and culture for kids up to age 12.  A multivitamin experience for the soul.  We leave with a satisfying feeling of authenticity everytime. Great culture space for children. Full of child centred humour such as warning signs that admonish responsible children to keep their parents under control and other signs that require patrons to line up in a Zig-Zag manner- these are dotted around the entrance hall and will give purpose and rewArd for eagle-eyed kids who seek them out! Fantastic venue for kids of all ages  interactive and hands on learning different aspects covered in each and every class Right in the heart of temple bar. Excellent for groups school tours or as a walk in We ve attended two of the summer  rockpaperscissors  events and the girls have had an absolute blast. Many thanks to all the staff for all their enthusiasm, patience and help The staff are always friendly its a really fun place of you have small kids The Giggler Treatment was excellent the kids loved it. Went to see Hatch in The Ark last Saturday. Have to say it was very enjoyable and can safely say my little ones had a blast. Well done guys Lovely place to bring young kids. The expositions vary but are generally of good quality and always interesting to kids. Found the facilities very basic. Although the show was well put together (how to Catch a star) the Senior Infants group I brought found it a bit long and uninteresting. I really like this place, its so Children friendly and the Shows they have for the kids are amazing! A small but nice gallery to display art exhibitions. Super save place for children to experience learning and entertainment. Also as a venue for creative workshops for young and not so young. Fantastic for children.  Great staff and great with children.  Great shows. Would definitely recommend Kids thoroughly enjoyed the production and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly."
171,The Art of Coffee,4.4875,"Friendly staff, you can seat and stay as long as you want and the staff respect your peace! It s a perfect location inside BPO building at Henry street.. Coffee s were good! Had latte and flat white for my friend! We had a really nice brunch. The dishes were very tasty, fulfilling, generously filled with salmon. The atmosphere was cosy and the stuff was friendly. It s a nice place to pause and relax :) easy to reach. nice place with white deco. many choices of coffee n food. with 2 floors n outside seats for you to choose. love the coffee. Nice flat-white, scones, Irish breakfast. Special mention to the lovely staff. I tapped the strategically positioned tip machine next to the till after ordering my food, thinking it was my bill. After that, they showed the real card machine, which was hidden behind the counter, and clarified that the other was a intended for tips. At first, I thought it was something that just happened to me(as it has some text about 1  tips), but other people also experienced the same situation, I have no problem giving tips, but what bothered me was the sense of being tricked. Fabulous breakfast made with fresh ingredients- white and black pudding both delicious- toast to die for. Coffee very good. My first brown scone in Ireland after I arrived  from Germany. So delicious! We always look for a non Starbucks coffee shop for our morning Joe. We found this one hidden in an old Victorian arcade. Super clean and bright premises and displays; the staff was courteous and attentive. I prefer my cappuccinos drier but as long as it s not Starbucks I was very happy Staff were sound seemed a bit annoyed we asked for coffees but sure look twas early and a Monday coffee s OK not the best not the worst food was decent very over priced but dublin city sure Decent Flat white (4/5 green stars) I stopped by The Art of Coffee in GPO arcade off Henry s Street to have a flat white ( 2.60). Staff members were very helpful and friendly. The coffee was strong, tasty and not over-roasted. Too many coffees are over-roasted. The foam wasn t the silkiest Ive ever had but it was decent   I was expecting to be blown away by the foam since they advertise their barista awards outside the cafe (although some of the awards are for latte art, and mine had no art   wah!). I m also giving them 4/5  green stars  for social and environmental impact. To-go drinks are delivered with no lid, encouraging customers to forgo the plastic. Soy and almond milk are available. Their beans are for sale in paper-based bags and they also sell them in 1 Kg sizes, reducing packaging a little. Most food on display (including sandwiches) is packaging-free (my current pet peeve is sandwiches in plastic clamshells). Along with their house blend they also offer a single-origin coffee, which changes every few months. Their Harcourt Rd. branch has a Saturday brunch menu that includes organic porridge, free-range eggs, and simple vegetarian fare like avocado toast. The main thing I d like to know about is their coffee sourcing   sustainability and fair pricing. Their website and coffee packages don t offer any info on this. Have contacted them - will update if they reply! Interested in writing green star reviews? If so, contact me! (greenstarsproject) I really like this place, staffs are always nice and the coffee is very tasty Best coffee in Dublin...... Amazing staff and ambience..... Perfect place to  work solo or a coffee date.... Great coffee shop with a very cozy atmosphere. Coffee is fruity (not Italian) which is great if you like it. I personally like bitter coffee more but this is the best fruity coffee Ive had in Dublin! The best coffee in Dublin. The customers service is great and Angelika and Asia are really friendly and helpful. They provide a very tasty coffee with beautiful latte art. A little gem of a coffee shop, spotlessly clean and tidy. The coffee is delicious and theres a nice range of snacks and food, the staff are fantastic and welcoming and I will certainly be back again soon Delicious scones and perfect coffee <3 Loved the place! Nice and quiet place for a break. I had an iced chai latte and a pecan square, super tasty and great value. Fast service. Toilets available but they are upstairs. Wheelchair accessibility: Toilets are small, and upstairs. No lift. Had a lovely panni with brie, pear and onion relish, pear tart and the other half had a delicious scone and cappuccino.  Very good value and the staff were very friendly and efficient.  Will definitely be back. coffee was excellent - its not easy to get a nice oat milk flat white, very nice here! the staff were also very nice and friendly Food Not a very good coffee imo. Tasted sour. The kind of coffee I try to avoid. The place is nice and clean. Perfect coffee shop and the same coffee. The best staff Wonderful coffee, very attentive staff. My only problem with this place is the gaudy decor, but you can t have it all I guess? Would highly recommend this place. Ivan, barista extraordinaire! He is the friendliest, warmest, nicest of them all. If I go to the city centre, this is where I prefer to have a coffee. Not only has it the best view of the Spike, not only is there a brilliant museum downstairs, not only is it a significant historical location - it also has great cheesecake. Always a great place to visit. All the other staff are great too. And of course, importantly, it is very accessible for wheelchair users & other people with health conditions. Beautiful spot. Probably the best hot chocolate Ive had in any cafe it was absolutely perfect. Staff are so friendly and welcoming! Very relaxing spot to hang out with friends or going solo! Highly recommend Food was terrible, cold, hard. I would avoid the  hot  breakfasts at all costs. Nice coffee in location, old arcade behind the General Post Office. Staff friendly, service quick, but be warned current regs in Ireland mean to sit inside you require proof of Covid vaccination. I was asked & current Scottish Government proof is not to international standards. Service was slow (due to two servers chatting behind while one did all the work serving customers), smoked chicken Ciabatta was dry and they gave out unnecessary amount of bags/cutlery making it impossible to eat on the go. Beautiful and comfortable. Excellent quality Very professional attention. Amazing place and staff, delicious coffee and food. Love to come in every day. Thank you guys. Best coffee in Europe! And we arrived here after Oslo, Bergen, Copenhagen, Berlin and Paris. Great food - soup great and pork sausage roll fabulous, as was quiche. Great people, terrific food locally sourced and home made. Food wasnt horrible but they display a trip advisor award on half the window so youd expect helpful and friendly staff. My food wasnt added to the order even though it was confirmed twice. When we questioned it we were ignored and I was made to line up again to order my meal. Worst food experience that Ive had in Ireland and do not recommend eating here. It seems that if u speak in a low/hoarse voice {due to a thyroid problem } its the customers fault if the counter staff cant hear u. My favourite place for lunch. The mini soup and sandwich for 7 euros is a bargain, good value for money. Great goat cheese sandwich. Friendly staff and fast service. Will recommended to anyone! Gem of a place,great selection of food, wonderful choice of cakes and super coffee. Very clean & staff are very friendly and helpful. Like the coffee so much I buy the coffee beans here to have when Im home To start the coffee is great, but not so much the service or food. We ordered the eggs benedict with bacon and avocado on toast. The food arrived and we got two eggs benedict. The reciept we got was someone elses order and we found out that our avocado was given to wrong customer. Either the chef put all orders out at same time and waitress messed up or he done orders wrong. Which means the avocado came out to other customer 10 minutes earlier my eggs would be sitting there for a long time. They went to cook the avocado and toast while I ate mine, which was not very nice. Bacon was though like it had been cooked, let cool and reheated. The poached eggs were more like a hard boiled egg. For me poached eggs should be soft. After i finished and my girlfriends toast was still not ready and we had to leave. When we told them the chef behind the counter threw his eyes to heaven and tried to push the avocado eggs and toast on us in a take away bag. Not something you pay that much money for to eat out of bag. We were offered a free pastery...... Id say stick to the coffee and pasteries which are nice. Cafe looks like it has to much going on and a staff who have to much to do. Id come back but only for a take away coffee Came in here on a Thursday morning before my mocks for a coffee and a quick look over notes .Staff were very friendly and the coffee was great. Perfect place early in the morning if you want a quiet place to relax and have a coffee :) Would highly recommend 10/10 The place is really nice and with good food and coffee. I give 2 stars because the staff is not as welcoming as last year. They are a bit cold and made me miss the old staff. The art of coffee is a treasure, the staff are welcoming and friendly, generous with their time and to top it all they do the best flat white Ive had in Dublin,    so drop in and treat yourself, Ill definitely be back This place is sooooooo good!!!! And staffs are incredible friendly.!!! Food is beautiful... ALMOND CROISSANT best Ive had.!!! Stunning!! Coffee... no words! PERFECTION!!!!! Indeed..!!! Best coffee ever!!!!!!! I recommend Art of Coffee to all my coffee loving friends. The gpo cafe is a bit small but beautifully designed. Staff are always so nice and helpful. I am so impressed with this fabulous coffee shop. I love to eat brunch but its very hard to find somewhere that does a nice brunch, with an old fashioned Irish fry, or eggs or granola and that has a chilled vibe. Well after months of trying out random places, Ive found this magnificent gem. I had a 7 piece Irish fry, granola with Greek yoghurt and a hot chocolate and my partner had their avocado toast with poached eggs and a Chai Latte. Everything was so tasty and they were so quick with our food. And the food was very reasonable. Vegetarian options: They offer healthy porridge, avocado toast with poached eggs, an omelette and tasty granola with Greek yoghurt. Kid-friendliness: They have lots of space if you need to bring a buggy in and the toilets have baby changing facilities and are situated on the ground floor. Wheelchair accessibility: The cafe is situated on the ground floor with wheelchair accessible toilets available too. Excellent spot for a coffee and some brunch. The coffee is beautiful (even the decaf, which is a huge plus!) and the food is really great. Would definitely efinitely recommend! Best breakfast/brunch/coffee place in Dublin. Great food and coffee, very nice interior. A spacious cafe with plush furniture. The staff are as friendly as your buddies. I recommend the Mozzarella sandwich as I was licking my lips for long after, so delicious it was. The coffee is served in actual mugs as opposed to cups and that is very much appreciated. The Art of Coffee is a wonderful shop and I highly recommend it.  They offer both regular coffee and iced coffee options as well as a number of pastries and other treats.   In addition they have ample seating for smaller groups to meet and relax in a pleasant environment.  Their service is excellent and fast as well.  My only comment is that I found the chocolate chip cookie that they offer to be rather dry, that might be the more traditional type of cookie in Ireland though because it reminded me of a biscuit or scone in many ways. Friendly, efficient service. Clean. Fresh. The atmosphere is that of a young, professional clientele.  The coffee is out of this world. The service is fast-paced and once you are seated (immediately) you feel calm, so they have an excellent balance. Food Its really the place of The Art of Coffee! Special coffee roasting will not leave you indifferent! Cosy and nice interier design with very comfy chairs!!! Good lighting and pleasant music on background!!! All of this is accompanied by delicious food.... Neat and tidy coffeeshop, especially ladys room! Strongly recommended!!! The Hot chocolates are like drinking velvet, the patisseries are works of delicious art, somewhere to savour! Always a pleasure for the eyes too. Loads of beautiful and delicious treats in a friendly atmosphere. Kind of addicted to it! The best coffee shop in Dublin!!! Lovely place with a stylish ambient for a quick bite :) usually not very crowded, so really enjoy being there during the weekends. Special thanks for amazing barista Bobby! I ve been to other Art of Coffees but this one trumps them all on taste and service. Very friendly waiters and amazing mocha 7 euro for a takeaway mozzarella tomato baguette, which is a bit steep considering it was JUST the roll and nothing else. Otherwise, its a lovely spot. Apparently, the coffee is great! Lovely atmosphere, friendly staff and food was delicious.. Fabulous place to relax .  Excellent service. Excellent food.  Couldnt ask for more. This is a great cafe. The art of coffee is a great place to chill, enjoy a good cup of coffee and some of the nice pastries or dishes they have for lunch. They have an amazing quiche and a great variation of sandwich with goat cheese, serrano ham and some other nice combinations. The staff is always amazing. No matter which art of coffee you go to, they will always be nice and happy. Ive been in many of them but mostly the one beside the river (Sir John Rogersons Quay) and the one beside the national maternity hospital (when my second son was born). They also have iced lattes all the time which is a big plus. I think many people like me, need an iced latte in the middle of the winter Coffee and cakes are excellent. Decor is beautiful, staff are friendly. Only fault is no toilet roll in mens or womens toilets. Great coffee with lovely staff! Deliciously balanced coffee, hitting those sweet arabica notes. Variety of boojy sandwiches and sweet treats available, I had a ciabatta with brie/rocket/caramelised onion/poached peach slices. Divine. Seating inside and some outdoor too and nice clean toilets. Recommended. Great espresso, very tasty sandwich Good place! Best coffee in Ireland without a doubt. The full Irish breakfast is a perfect compliment with their signature coffee. Loved my visit to The Art of Coffee, I came along it,by accident while on a short visit to Dublin city It had a lovely relaxed feel to it and the toasted sandwich and hot chocolate were delicious! The staff ,were very pleasant and loved the background music and books available to read I will be back Good coffee and an excellent pastrami sandwich The best lunch experience Ive had in a long time. Sandwich, soup and coffee for  13     well played Nice relaxed place to have a good breakfast, fast and good attention. Lovely coffee I went to collect a Too Good to Go bag here in May. Good food. I got about 4 or 5 items for 4.99. Popped in for tea, really nice spot neatly tucked away. Seems to attract business people. Good staff and great coffee , one of the few places open early too Lovely coffee & Wonderful staff, very friendly and lovely to chat with. They gave my little boy a croissant and made him feel very special. Thanks a million, will visit again. Great food, great coffee and great place to eat. The attention to detail in their food, dining area and washrooms are excellent. Also - this place is kid friendly. Newborn friendly to be exact :) This place is wonderful. Great tea, good food - which a nice selection of vegetarian options - and excellent,  efficient service. Good coffee (with oatmilk) & tasty cake! Open, spacious, clean. Good food, tasty cakes... Recommend the muesli slice for a quick snack... Its probably not healthy but tastes soooo good! Was over at Holles street hospital and popped around to grab coffee and a sandwich. Both were excellent along with great service from friendly staff. Highly recommend Lovely staff. Spotless premises. Great food and great coffee. Ive been to many coffee shops and that is by far the best and tastiest Well what can I say, great little coffee shop this, had sandwiches and coffees while herself was in Holles St having a baby, really great coffee and most importantly at very reasonable prices sambos also very tasty will definitely be back Vegetarian options: Vegetarian sandwiches available Great coffee. Staff are lovely Great place to eat very close to Holles St. Would highly recommend. Good food, coffee. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Great staff great service . was in and out for a week while partner was in hollies st hospital . I really love this cafe. The decor is comfortable industrial. The coffee and pastries are delicious. Its just a really relaxing spot. The music is great too. Great staff and lovely food and drinks. Always very clean and a friendly atmosphere. I visit here often."
172,The Art of Coffee - Dublin 8,4.825,"Lovely cafe, very cosy atmosphere with nice seating area. Good option for remote work. They serve great coffee, and have a big choice of sandwiches. Very friendly and helpful staff. Lovely cafe with cosy & warm atmosphere. Cant go wrong with their coffee. They also offer pastries and sandwiches. Staff were very nice. Definitely recommend! Really modern and stylish Caffe! Tasty treats, paninis, wraps and qushe available. Full of flavour coffee, very enjoyable atmosphere! Highly recommended! Food Modern cafe in Dublin 8, nice setting and vibe. Good coffee. Didnt try the food. It was raining outside and we were looking for a shelter. We randomly came across this beautiful cafe and we definitely recommend to visit this place. The soup of the day (meat soup) was delicious, same as the peanut butter & caramel cup and cappuccino. Prices are good, a large selection of sandwiches, wraps and sweet pastries. It s located near to the Guinness Storehouse. Beautiful cafe absolutely loved the design and decor. Found a gorgeous seating area as we walked out to toilets! Really liked it here. Found on the way to the guiness storehouse. Lots of choices, nice food and drinks. Friendly staff. Really recommend! Such a cool place, natural plants everywhere and the area out the back is stunning with the tree growing through the middle.  Very bitter Espresso however. Awesome cafe, good for families too. The food was as delicious as the decor was nice. Kid-friendliness: There was a highchair for toddlers and enough space to put it next to the table. I ordered a Mozzarella chiabatta for take-away. They heated it up, when I actually wanted it cold. Then when I wanted to eat it, half of the Mozzarella and a tomato was stuck to the paper. My fingers were oily afterwards. I mean, the Sandwich was great but maybe You could give the customers the option, wether they want it heated it up or not. Lovely coffee shop, very cosy atmosphere. They serve great coffee, and have a big choice of sandwiches. Very friendly and helpful staff. I had the chorizo sandwich it was stunning. Really good coffee too Beautiful place! Outside sitting looks like garden under the roof. Its amazing. I ate here strictly for the atmosphere. I wanted to sit under the glass roof with all the greenery and the string lights. I had soup, which was surprisingly good, and the crunchy bread that came with it was excellent. I also had a caramel bar for dessert. This is a beautiful and inexpensive place to grab a light meal or just coffee. Really lovely cafe, the muffins and millionaire s shortbread were really good. Definitely recommend, good value. Super environment especially in the courtyard Pastrami sandwich was awesome - the best of the year! Food Really loved this cafe, there are plenty of seats and it was warm so a great escape from the cold. They have alot of cafe food options and coffees. Lovely coffee, well prepared with very friendly staff. 10 out of 10. Such a great experience and atmosphere. Food Amazing vibe and amazing service. Often come and work here with my laptop as well, it s a lovely setting Really nice place, great coffee and delicious brownie One of the best Coffe ever . The place is absolutely amazing .super relaxing sitting area and the staff no words ( friendly and respectful)  literally 5         I highly recommend you f you want to have the best Coffe and atmosphere in Dublin Lovely spot in the city centre . Tasty coffee and good service Great cafe! Service, choice of high quality food and delicious coffee. Best coffee in Dublin, Lovely friendly staff and excellent customer service. Definitely a must if you like your coffee cafe culture. Food : 5/5 Perfect place to grab a quick sandwich, wrap or a quick coffee. Loads of delicious options for lunch. Located in quite a convenient place as well. Classy and tidy place for a pot of tea and chill ambience! Very good service and nice ambience, but only mediocre coffee at best Beautiful shop, very nice staff and definitely the best coffee in town. I will be back. Perfect coffee,friendly staff, very cozy atmosphere!Definitely recommend this place!!! Reasonably priced quite tasty coffee a good place to stop off for a break. Really impressed!! Beautiful restaurant/ coffee shop An oasis in Dublin 8 ! Food : 5/5 Fun.  Congenial and helpful staff. very good coffee and food, friendly staff, I recommend this place Food Amazing place with amazing staff and great food and coffee, top marks! Lovely coffee. Very nice atrium to drink it too. Good coffee and good service. Loved the place. The staff was really friendly Excellent I m a regular at this Art of Coffee. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is good. Excitingly, they ve just started serving hot brunch food. That being said, I was very disappointed with the Eggs Benedict I ordered. It was served on a stale seeded roll with way too much rocket, not an English muffin which left it feeling very dry and bready, and difficult to eat. I really hope to see the quality of the brunch improve over time!"
173,The Bakehouse Dublin,3.975,"Food choices felt a bit limited and hot breakfast food took a lot longer than I would have expected. The cafe itself felt like maybe management or owners dont care for it. Got asked for money multiple times while sitting outside. On the up side, the food was well presented and the staff were very nice. The food here was really nice. However, the toilet was disgusting. The sink was filthy. The toilet, well it needed a good clean without going into too much information, I ll let you use your imagination. The toilet check sheet hadn t been signed since the 18th which was 4 days ago and you really could tell. If they put as much effort into the cleaning as the food, it would be a 5 star establishment. Absolutely delicious food, got the skillet. Staff was friendly and accommodating, were very generous with substitutions and add ons. I d absolutely come back, best breakfast i ve had in a while. Quite honestly the worst sausage I ve had in my life. 7.5  for untoasted white bread with a barely cooked sausage. I couldn t even eat more than two bites. The halloumi sandwich was marginally better but really not much flavour. I have to go get another breakfast now. The staff was friendly and they throw in two sub par mini chocolate muffins. Surly wait staff, slow service and food which is not as described. The baked goats cheese salad was basically a few leaves and three (cold) pieces of crumbled goats cheese. I complained and was given some extra luke-warm cheese but for the price (and time it took to make) this is definitely a 1* and public recommendation to avoid. Loved the place! Tried their coffee and (wow) free cup cake that they give as the complement - have to say it gave a great start to my day. My wife has been a regular here for sometime and loves the place. All in all, a great little cafe. I went for the bacon brioche , it was grand was meant to come with breakfast potatoes instead came with a side of crisps the fact it was st Patricks day may of caused them issues, staff were all very friendly,  good location. Lovely quirky cafe hidden away from the touristy hot spot I ordered the pudding brioche consisting of white and black pudding, a fried egg and spinach in a toasted brioche bun. The pudding was cooked perfectly with a slight crust to the edges. The egg was gooey and kept the whole sandwich moist and leaked all over the inside of the bun. My partner ordered the pancakes which were fluffy and fresh. Would definitely recommend here. Didn t get a chance to sample the baked goods but two lovely homemade cupcakes came with the coffees! We loved this place for breakfast.  It was very close to our Hotel.  It was a delicious Irish breakfast at a fair price.  It is a very cozy place.  Great coffee as well! Hotel prices, no quality. 12 for a cold sausage, cut in half and stuffed on a partially toasted piece of bread. Service was pleasant, but no atmosphere, and rather cold in side. Terrible service. You walk in, no one acknowledges you or even speaks to you. A takeaway sandwich takes half an hour. You have to awkwardly queue in the middle of the service walkway amongst tables. Food is dry, bland, tasteless, microwaved for extortionate price. Go to McDonalds breakfast, way better all round. Excellent place for a typical brunch! Everything was delicious. Glad to have come!! The breakfast is the stand out factor here, it was so good! Service was ok. The only let down is there are only about 5 tables, the staff make people wait at the door until you finish, which means people are just staring at you watching everything you eat until you re done , it just felt a bit uncomfortable and not relaxing at all. FIRST TIME EXPERIENCING RACISM DISCRIMINATION - felt strongly about writing a review of the place. My friends and I ordered three dishes: one bacon brioche and two sausage brioches. My friends received their foods first, and the waitress said for me to wait just a minute. What I thought would be one minute turned into 35 minutes(no joke); I asked whether my food was coming out or not while I waited. My friends had to leave before me because they had booked a tour and I was left sitting by myself. Finally, I decided to ask the waitress to cancel the order, but, since that wasnt a possibility, I settled on take-out. What infuriated me was that people who I saw come into the store at least 20 minutes after I sat down had already received their sausage brioche, which was the same dish I ordered. I believe I am right to assume that they didnt want to serve me the food first---BECAUSE I WAS ASIAN. I was trying to recall the situation that played out in the restaurant while sitting in my AIRBNB eating my somewhat-cold brioche. NOT WORTH 10.5 BUCKS FOR THE BRIOCHE EITHER. This place is one of Dublins hidden gems when it comes to breakfast. The location is very central and allows for it to be easily found. The restaurant itself isnt very big but they can fit a lot of people with the space they have. The staff is also very friendly and even though they work at a fast pace, are attentive. The food is amazing. I had the skillet breakfast and my friend had a bacon plate - unfortunately I dont remember the exact name. We also shared an order of the pancakes. Our favorite item  (as ironic as it is) were the potatoes - I dont know how theyre cooked but theyre perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside without being too hot or too dry. I highly recommend coming here if youre considering it. The skillet plate also does an amazing job of giving a new spin on the typical Irish breakfast while reaching new levels of flavor. Bang average I m afraid! I took two friends for breakfast (one for his birthday) and it wasn t for us. There was a 20 minute wait but to be fair we did walk up with no reservation and to the credit of front of house the extremely polite and courteous blonde lady was keeping up to date on progress. I ordered oats which was stone cold and my tea was luke warm. My friends had the full breakfast but confirmed to me it was average at best. Such a shame really as on paper this should be a good spot. Not for us. A star for the front of house and a star for the mini muffin. The hunt for a solid full Irish  breakfast continues! We ordered breakfast for our office for delivery today and it was absolutely delicious. The food was so fresh and still pipping hot. We had a selection of breakfast baps, fruit, pastries, with gluten and vegan options also,  there was not one iota of food left. Everyone adored it. We will 100% be ordering from you guys again.  So lovely and easy to deal with especially Shauna. Absolutely love this place! One of the best breakfasts in Dublin. The skillet is amazing with very good flavours of black and white pudding. Friend had a stack of pancakes and they looked amazing and tasted even better. Staff are always friendly and welcoming. Always the first place to go if I m in Dublin early morning. Can t wait to go back! As the other reviews state ( which I wished I had read ) barely cooked sausage, barely toasted bread, (what s that about!? I ve never seen that before. Either toast or don t.) Everything covered in grease and garlic. Everything was flaccid. Including the staff. The atmosphere died inside. Avoid. Can t believe I just overpaid for that. Have walked by this place so many times. And every time I keep saying we need to try this place out. I wish we done this earlier. The food here is just first class. The tea I loved. You cant beat real tea leaves. I will be back to try more from the menu. The prices wont leave a whole in you pocket and you will be more the happy with what you get for what you paid. Had no room to try their dessert but will come back to try their tea and cake special. Stopped here for a bite and a beer after a long flight in. Cute inside. Food is delicious. Beer was crisp. Would recommend. Didn t get a picture sadly as food was too delicious to wait. If nice weather sit outside overlooking the Ha penny bridge. Cheese & tomato toastie with chips was good value, tasty and arrived quickly Food : 5/5 Found this on Google, it has good reviews so we went there to check it out. The service was great. The staff were very polite and helpful. Very good quality sausages and bacon. Only downside we all agreed on is that they overcooked the eggs. The yolks were solid which wasnt very nice. Apart from that it was all good and definitely worth a visit. Wasn t too fund of this place. The staff were lovely but seemed to be in a world of their own. Ordered hot chocolate (which was gorgeous!) and a glass of orange juice to start off with. But then we ordered some food. I can t remember what it was called but it was meant to resemble a proper Irish breakfast. So they served us some pancakes (which looked fantastic) except it wasn t what we ordered. We sent it back and they apologised for their mistake. They brought out a second dish some minutes later, and it was some sort of sandwhich, with fried eggs and bacon. My boyfriend and I were so confused but decided not to return it back AGAIN. So we kept the food, which was a mistake on our part as it wasn t enjoyable. The bread was soggy for some reason which ruined the meal. I m not sure if I would return here. The Bailey s coffee was fresh and tasty. The food - huge portions. My fries were crisp and tasty. The burger - huge and juicy, cooked just right. I stopped in because it seemed like a locals place - which having sat here for about an hour I can honestly say that is exactly what it is. Fresh food and good service. Highly recommend. Great staff, great music! The food is good, generous portions, perfect for brunch and lunch. I had the blue cheese salad and they were very generous with the blue cheese which was perfect! Go for it! Nicest coffee Ive ever had in my life from the young girl making them today, even with a queue she took care with every drink :) Service is amazing and food is so good! I got the Bacon Butty, Irish black bacon (like American ham) served with two fried eggs and Bakehouse tomato relish (adds amazing flavor and a small kick) on Bakehouse bloomer bread (like thick sourdough or sandwich bread). I got mine toasted. It s quite lace and could easily be shared. Perfect brunch item. Great for kids, easy location. Directly in front of bus stop. Pastries are amazing as well. My friend and I stumbled on this gem while on a mission to find great coffee and a baked good. We were not disappointed....Excellent brunch cafe offering a variety of egg based dishes.  I ordered the salmon hash (see pictures) and my friend ordered an omelette.  Service was great and the food was even better, highly recommend! Freezing cold, couldn t take my coat of. Bland soup and staff.With a name like the Bakehouse I would expect amazing baked goods but I got a piece of plain white bread with my soup and the cakes didn t look worthy of tasting. Won t return The staff was really nice. The food was okayish, however I wasnt expecting a food that greasy (from the taste of it), also Im pretty sure they mixed up my order so yeah... Wouldnt recommend but go and see for yourself  . Might have been a bad day. Such a cosy cafe. The staff are lovely and the food was amazing! I had the mushroom brioche- highly recommend!  I also ordered a mocha- which was the best mocha I ve ever had Genuinely the best breakfast! Popped in on the offchance they had room for us after passing by, we were seated straight away. Tables are small and close but gave the place a great atmosphere with great decor. I had the mushrooms on toast which is not my usual thing and it didnt disappoint. Shame we werent in Dublin very long otherwise Id have definitely gone back the next day. One of the best breakfasts Ive had in a while. They serve arguably the best breakfast tea Ive ever had, Wall & Keogh. I had beans on toast with a fried egg, and my mate had an omelette. Both came out excellently. Easy to get to from OConnell Street as well. Lovely service and great atmosphere; pop tunes to sing along to while you have an excellent breakfast. Best poached eggs Ive ever had. A bit slow  but good food is worth the wait.   Lovely teashop right in the centre of Dublin. Really welcoming vibe in this place - small wait of around 20 mins for a table of 4, which is fine considering the size of the place. It can be quite loud in there but it adds to the atmosphere. The all-day brunch was flavourful and high quality, and good service So good. So fresh. The brunch is one of the best on earth omg. If you visit Dublin you definitely have to stop here to eat an Irish breakfast. Best full Irish Ive had. About  17 for the Bakehouse Grill, a side of beans, and a cappuccino. Really cute decor. Great sausage, not too fatty; same with the puddings. Perfectly cooked eggs, not too runny.  Not quite sure I prefer the cheesy beans over regular, but theyre a fun alternative. The sauce is like a tomato basil ketchup. Bacon butty was excellent, massive but excellent. Friendly staff and good value for money for the portion you get. Was a little disappointed though that they didnt do sandwiches on the Sunday as I wanted to try the pulled pork but I will go back for it."
174,The Bald Barista,4.725,"We went here all 4 mornings that we were in Dublin, and felt like family when we said goodbye! Delicious lattes,  yogurt, porridge and pastries.  We were fortunate they were right across the street from our hotel, but definitely worth a walk from wherever you are in Dublin! (I may have already given a review while dealing with jetlag) We stayed across the street at Thomas Moore Inn, 5 nights.  Each morning we started our day at The Bald Barista.  The yogurt and porridge was amazing.  Coffee perfect.  The Barista greets you at the door and he brightens your day with his kindness and enthusiasm.  His staff is friendly and charming.  The morning we had to leave they all gave us big hugs!  We will never forget them. Great place for breakfast, resonable prices and friendly staff. Fresh sandwiches and coffee Food Very cute breakfast spot with excellent food, friendly staff and good prices. On our holiday we eat here twice. We enjoyed it very much! The staff were very nice and kind. So sweet! I love it, coffee is delicious, same as all the food in there, is freshly cooked and taste amazing. The service is very quick and kind I arrived early morning from Paris, I checked in my hotel and without missing a beat I started to explore the neighbourhood, as I was waking around and taking in the amazing sights and scene, I saw a sign saying  The bald Barista Cafe  and chuckled a bit and said to my self, just imagine you walk in and the employees are all Bald!! So I did walk in and I was faced with non other than the owner, the man behind the logo, I was greeted with a smile and I was impressed on his professionalism and kind personality I felt a good energy and I really wanted to order something, as I let the guests behind me to go an ahead so I can read the menu, so I ordered a hot chocolate. With a chocolate chips cookie.   The cookie was good, hot chocolate was also good, I could taste the chocolate over milk which I like. The most important part was the experience I have at this cafe. Way to start the day with such awesome energy. Great breakfast options. Many sandwiches to choose from as well as sweets. Try the apple crumble. It is a very cozy coffee shop as well, with more tables on the second floor. Food : 5/5 I have visited the Bald Barista many times over the past year because his delicious coffee and friendly service. I always leave the cafe with a smile on my face! I would recommend this cafe to anyone who appreciates great coffee and great people. An excellent a very affordable place to grab breakfast. We had two begal breakfast sandwiches for less than 6 euro each. Beautiful and delicious coffee as well with cute latte art. The barista was also joked arround with us and made us feel very welcome! I highly recommend! A great little place to drop into. Nice friendly atmosphere and the owner and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Good coffee and hot chocolate. The snacks are very good too. Visited with my partner today after my mam told me The Bald Barista had the best coffee shes ever had in Dublin (yes, shes a connoisseur!). Beautiful coffee, lovely food, welcoming atmosphere and fabulous staff. The man himself was there, and was so welcoming and cheerful. They made our day :-) We really enjoyed our little visit and we cant wait to visit this wonderful independent coffee shop again. Possibly one of my favourite cafes in Dublin. Excellent hot beverages, available in big size and a wide variety of food. Super affordable and in the centre of the city. Good place with very warm and friendly staff. They have a huge selection of sandwiches which i have forgotten to take a photo of Their breakfast menu has a lot of options too. I got the scrambled egg and sausages and bread. You can choose white or brown bread and coffee regular or large. Honestly the portion was a lot, that i didnt finish the eggs. They have a nice seating area on the upper deck or you can also sit outside (though tables are fewer) Overall it s a great place and it s close to major tourist spots so could be a good place to get a good breakfast before you kickstart your tours :) Food is good, croissant taste great. The coffee is a bit mid though, but Ive tasted worse. A very cool place to grab some morning breakfast with coffee! We found this spot while staying at the Hilton on our trip to Ireland. I had a migraine after the flight and needed caffeine stat. We are coffee freaks, not beer freaks. We were not disappointed with our drinks and breakfast and happy we checked them out to kick off our Trip to Ireland. Travelling through, stopped at the cafe. Best ever Chai latte, and vegan sausage roll. Amazing and caring staff. Defiantly worth a visit Really enjoyed sipping our coffee in this cafe, which we found by chance while looking for a seat during a very crowded Dublin afternoon. They make very good espresso (this is an Italian speaking) and the place is nice and cozy. Also the staff was lovely. They serve Fixx coffeebeans which I was really excited about. I ordered an oat flat white and it didn t disappoint me, hence the art   but it didn t bother me much since the coffee was great. It had a nice blend of strong espresso and smooth milk. Definitely will give it another go! They have indoor and outdoor seats. Had a cappuccino, it was really nice. The staff seemed a bit disorganized. The food was not to my standard. Had a full Irish Breakfast, the beans were cold, eggs were rubber, overall a bit disappointing. Great little find for breakfast and a coffee. Food and drinks were great and super friendly staff Very good breakfast and nice location. This is a great spot for breakfast and lunch with a good sized menu featuring breakfast staples like eggs on toast, porridge, a full Irish, etc., as well as plentiful sandwiches, wraps, and paninis for lunch. The star of the show is their coffee! I ordered a cappuccino (pictured), and was delighted when I received it with Enjoy written on top! The coffee was very good, and I ordered the scrambled eggs on toast as well which were simple but tasty. They have an upstairs area for seating, as well as outdoor seating for a nice day, so plenty of spots to sit down and enjoy. The seating area is not overly decorated, but that s no bother for me. Delicious coffee and food. I highly recommend a stop here. Very friendly service and they re open early. Full breakfast, Irish style! Massive menu and great options for coffees and teas. Order at the counter then take a seat upstairs. Not wanting a full breakfast?, wonderful assortment of baked goods as well. Best coffee in town. And the staff is super nice and attentive Great coffee, good food.  Wonderful ambiance adequate seating, chill music.  Overall great vibe for a place to sit and have a coffee and small bite. Great little shop, friendly people, tasty coffee and sandwiches at a good price. Perfect place for breakfast, the scrambled eggs and  the raspberry shortbread were delicious! The staff are so lovely and the atmosphere is great. Awesome music too!cant recommend enough! Will definitely come back next time I am in Dublin! Amazing coffee, pastries, and breakfast. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend A place for Irish breakfast and nice coffee. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Love their smiles on the faces Finally found a decent hot chocolate like we have back in NZ. Turns out the owner is a Kiwi - how good! Lovely food and great service Perfect place for a quick, healthy and well priced breakfast.  And of course the coffee is excellent.  Our go to breakfast spot. A great and affordable place in town to grab some quick breakfast. great friendly staff and a great variety of breakfast menu and Veg option. Good Coffee as well . Food : 5/5 I had breakfast and coffee here. The coffee was very good, and that is probably their primary treat, but the food was a bit of a disapointment. The eggs were very bland, they really lacked seasoning. And the bread was rather dry and tasteless as well. And on top of that the staff did not seem very attentive or accommodating Went to bald barista today. They have the reputation of one of the best coffee places in Dublin. The owner was in today which boosted the quality of coffee to a whole new level. Very good coffee. The interior looks nice and music is ok. The atmosphere is relaxing.. Quick pleasant service and really good flat whites. Had a couple ham and cheese croissants. The plate came with a tiny salad? Garnish? It doesnt matter because this place was clean and got me the coffee and food that I so desperately needed. The best thing about this place is the Barista. Coffee is amazing. Friendly staff, cozy atomosphere. Highly recommended Very friendly Barista and quick. We were on a hurry and had some orders. The Barista was fast and very friendly and the drinks were very good. This place is the most expensive in Dublin. The coffee is so dry nearly bitter its 3rd rate yet they like too makeout its expensive  too buy!its not.the price is nearly  4.00.for a regular small coffee   its absolutely outrageous daylight robbery.ud think hed help the community and country that gave generously too help this mans business!hes food is 3rd rate aswell checkout his prices. Cakes are old fashioned  below average see photos!this man has no respect for Irish ppl..he has never given back too the community he just keeps upping prices every year.its extortionate prices for again 3rd rate coffee..so sad.folks keep falling for it..its famous for robbing tourists.they constantly moan.cant blame them. Cheap food cheap coffee cheap management. Stay away..avoid this hell hole..worst review ever so disappointed"
175,The Book of Kells Experience,4.425,"Its an amazing book and the museum tour is worth your time (if not the fee). But you only get to see one page of the Book, so they should call it the Page of Kells. We had the tour without the experience virtual reality part, so that was probably worth getting if you want to see the book in greater detail.  And the library upstairs was awesome but all the books are almost gone for preservation. See it before they are all gone! Note there is no bathroom until you exit the tour so keep that in mind. The Book of Kells library at Trinity College Dublin is an absolute gem! This historic treasure trove showcases the stunning craftsmanship of medieval artists with its beautifully illuminated manuscripts. Walking through the library feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by centuries-old texts and intricate designs. Its a fascinating glimpse into the past and a must-visit for anyone interested in history or art. The atmosphere is so serene, and theres this sense of awe knowing youre in the presence of something truly special. Trust me, its an experience you wont forget! Amazing experience! The library is jaw-dropping! Unfortunately many books were taken out for digitalization. I want to thank you, our tour guide, for the great wall around the campus and interesting stories! Be sure to buy tickets a few days in advance. This please is must visit. June 2024- We loved the Trinity Long Room, but arent religious so the Book of Kells was not a big deal to us. Things to know: You must book tickets in advance and they cost! We didnt know this, we arrived in the morning and were able to book for the evening. They do offer a family deal for entry. The books in the Long Room are being removed to salvage/repair/store. Only two sections had actual books in them. Still fully worth it to see the room, but would be way more impactful with all the books. From the information available, it does not sound like the books will ever be returned to the Long Room. They have added the sculptures of four women to the room (full of sculptures of men), so that was nice. Also, its hot in there. Like, really really hot. And it was not an uncomfortably hot day in Dublin. We actually liked Marshs Library better- the oldest library in Dublin where James Joyce sat in one of the chairs you can sit in and you can check out the desk where Bram Stoker studied maps of Transylvania. The Book of Kells Experience. The art of book making, which is presently exhibited at Trinity College. The Book is over 1,000 years old. Everything was written and drawn by hand. The detailing of the drawings is simply amazing. The history of the creation of this book is very interesting, the materials from which this book is made, the paint which used to write and paint this book. A visit to the Long Room is also impressive. Despite the fact that most of the books in the library are under restoration, this is just incredible! The number of books, the organization of space, the busts of scientists, the atmosphere of the library itself. A must see if you are in Dublin. The ticket costs 21.5 euros. It is better to take in advance. Parking lots around are quite expensive, sometimes it is quite difficult to find free parking lots. This should be kept in mind Very nice place for a free visit in the main outdoor courtyard. The interior of the famous and very old library is accessible but requires a fee. The cost of the visit is a little expensive but contributes to the restoration and maintenance of the books. Books of Kells Experience is magnanimous. The beautiful library holds several first edition copies of many significant books over centuries. The minute you step into this library, the atmosphere of this place transports you to a different world. This feels as though in movies. There is an entry fee and this library is currently closed for renovation. Do check their website before you plan on visiting. OK, I love this place. The long room with the great globe hanging from the ceiling and the long room reimagined or just incredible and worth a visit alone. Then the book of Kells itself was interesting/. We also walked around part of the campus and enjoyed the day it was beautiful there were several people who must be having a graduation ceremony taking pictures outside this is definitely worth a visit if you are in Dublin Amazing experience if you are in Dublin. Located at Trinity College, the Book of Kells is an illuminated manuscript and Celtic Gospel book in Latin containing the four Gospels of the New Testament estimated to have been written around 800 AD. We went during the library renovation project, so many of the books were still off the shelves. On paper it looked very interesting and majestic.  Unfortunately when we arrive we see that 80% of the books are being restored.  So its very good but were still a little unsatisfied.  Despite everything, the large gallery remains majestic.  And it encourages reflection and calm.  The Book of Kells itself is breathtaking.  The short film that presents his story is breathtaking.  Same for the reproduction of the gallery with the projections.  Thats wonderful. We did the Book of Kells experience along with a tour of Trinity campus. Of the two, I was more excited about the Book of Kells but ended up enjoying the campus tour more. We had a great guide named Owen who was both extremely knowledgeable and who was able to communicate all the history of the campus in entertaining and engaging stories. The long room at the library was very special, even mostly devoid of books. We sat and enjoyed the space for a bit and I was able to do a drawing of the room. The Book of Kells experience was very crowded and difficult to navigate: it wasnt clear exactly what the flow was supposed to be and no matter what you were trying to look at, someone would be standing in front of it. By the time we made it to the book itself it was rather anticlimactic and we werent really able to pore over it and admire the details. Ah well. The gift shop was nice and there were easy to access bathrooms. Glad I did it, would recommend, probably wouldnt do it again myself. Absolutely incredible experience! Although there are not many books left in the long room due to restoration it is still a must see! Especially with the Earth exhibition. The book of Kells experience was very informative and the audio-guides were interesting but not long winded. The second interactive experience was amazing, could have stayed and watched it all day. An absolute must do in Dublin It is incredible that this book survived since 800 CE. I just wish it was displayed so you could see it better. It lies flat under glass in a dark room for preservation. Understandable but disappointing. The Old Library had few books but the room is impressive and makes for a great instagram photo. The interactive section in the third area was very well done and informative. The library is magnificent but I give it 2 stars because the entrance is much too expensive and, as it is under construction, my visit lasted 15 minutes! So  20 for 15 minutes is way too expensive and inaccessible to everyone. However there is the library which is impressive Decent exhibition, fairly busy and the only guide is a self guided audio tour. A lot of the books in the library are now gone (taken for preservation). The secondary digital experience is cool. All in all it took about an hour to get through everything. The Book of Kells Experience is an absolute must-visit for anyone in Dublin! Stepping into the Trinity College old library is like stepping back in time   the grandeur and history are simply awe-inspiring. The Book of Kells itself is a masterpiece, intricately detailed and beautifully preserved. The experience of viewing it up close is truly unforgettable. The knowledgeable guides provide fascinating insights into the history and significance of this ancient manuscript. And of course, exploring the old library is an experience in itself   the towering shelves of books create a magical atmosphere. Visiting the Trinity College old library is an absolute must for anyone interested in history, art, or culture. Its an experience that will stay with you long after you leave. Additionally, dont forget to bring headphones to fully immerse yourself in the audio guide experience. Wonderful to see the old library, but disappointed to see the empty shelves due to restoration works. The liberty houses the Book of Kells, the illustrated gospel written in the island of Iona, transferred to Kells and then later moved here. The long library room looks familiar from many movies. The fare seems a bit high. It is the number 2 visiting spot in Dublin. The Book of Kells experience felt disjointed and out of sequence. You see the actual book right at the beginning, but without any understanding of its significance. Later, theres a short video that gives a fantastic overview of the history and lore of the book. I wish the tour had started with the video, followed by seeing the book. For 25 euros, I would have skipped the tour. The audio tour download was confusing and didnt sync up with the display areas, even with Bluetooth enabled on my phone. Overall, it was a disappointing experience. Very cool experience to see the Book of Kells. The library is awesome. While we were there, they had removed most of the books for cleaning and restoration.  The immersive experience was neat to view some of the digital documents. Liked the history portion about the Library and The Book of Kells. It cost us $67 American for 4 of us, so its a bit pricey for the hour we spent there. It is worth a visit, but prepare yourself that the long room is full of empty shelves because the books are taken for preservation and digitalisation. Honestly, it is a bit disappointing but understandable. You can have a nice walk on the campus and go to the experimentarium, where the 2 main attractions are basically 2 short documentary movies projected to 2 different unique shape canvases. Its okay, but would deserve more. Overall, it was a good experience with kids, took about 40-30 minutes each but you can run thru in 5-5 minutes, if you are in a rush. Apart from the library just projections and Led screens where you can read and watch short films. This is one of the most interesting times in the history of the library to visit, in my opinion. Many people express disappointment that many of the books have been removed for restoration  but I found that the team in Trinity College showcased how monumental this time was very well. Its a rare chance to see the bare shelves of the library. The modern side of the exhibit is also very interesting and engaging. This old library is part of Trinity College complex and is a must see. Its tickets can be purchased separately to Trinity College tour. Besides the book you can view this amazing library with all wood finishes. Weve been to the long room many times but wanted to see the Book of Kells experience. It was quite disappointing, considering the technology available nowadays and what weve seen for other events like this. As usual the Long Room, many of the books have been removed for restauracion and cleaning. Regardless, visiting the library never disappoints! The library is very impressive, and it s definitely a must-go (it s possibly the biggest library I ve ever been to). However, the tickets are too expensive (25 ) for what the visit itself lasts (less than 1 hour). It is the first one I have done and I think it is a wonderful experience, so I recommend its visit since it is a great opportunity to know the history of the book of Kells from another point of view, the price of the entrance is according to the experience, all the staff is very friendly and attentive that they take you to live a unique experience. The audio guide is free and in different languages asking to listen from your own device and your headphones. Really enjoyable, very informative. Loved the immersive experience. Decent gifts in the gift shop and reasonably priced. I felt sorry for some tourists who couldnt use the guide on their phone because the WiFi was broken. Delighted to see the 1916 Proclamation displayed, and the Book itself is amazing. Well worth visiting, overall. Great experience. Loved seeing the inside of the library and the history. Tess does one heck of a tour. Highly recommended as she s a historian and went to the actual school. Quite funny as well. Its a fun and great experience to learn more about the marvelous Book of Kells. The 180deg movie is amazing! I think its really worth a visit and, if you go, make sure you bring headphones so you can listen to the guided tour on your phone We absolutely loved this exhibit that made us learn more about Ireland. We didn t buy any tickets in advance and went anyways. They said it was sold out, so we had to book online (no option to buy on site) and come back later that same day. The first stop is the book of Kells. The Book of Kells is an illuminated manuscript and Celtic Gospel book in Latin,containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables. It was created in a Columban monastery. It is believed to have been created c. 800 AD. The exhibit was interactive with a free audio guide app and wifi. It was followed by a beautiful light show. The second stop is the library, which was simply breathtaking. Most beautiful library in the world. It also had the harp that is the symbol of Ireland. We then learned more about great thinkers and influential women. We loved it all!! Magnificent experience. We are amazed! It is a shame that the campus visit was canceled due to bad weather. However, the library, the book of Kell, the performances are superb. The Book of Kells experience is essential. Not only do you get to learn about this amazing book and see it, you see the Long Room of the famous library and then a 3D immersive experience about  both. A must visit if in Dublin. Mixed experience: Although the site is historically fascinating and the quality of the exhibition is undeniable, I was disappointed by some aspects of my visit. The entrance fee was quite high, especially considering that parts of the site were under construction. I expected the price to be justified by a flawless experience, but unfortunately that wasnt the case. The library is currently undergoing restoration but still looks very impressive. The audio guide was very entertaining; would recommend bringing your own headphones otherwise you have to hold your phone up to your ear to hear the guide. It only took around 1 hour to complete the tour, see the book, and the library. Gaia in the Long Room at Trinity College Dublin Ireland   , was able to experience and see the spectacular illuminated artwork by Luke Jerram which is now on display in the Old Library. Gaia features 120dpi detailed NASA imagery of the Earth s surface, showcasing the planet floating in three dimensions as it might be viewed from space Our tour guide Antonio was unbeliavable. Best guide we had so far. Knowledgeable of the history in Dunlin, fun and positive person. I will highly recommend  to all my friends  and family. The Book of Kells tour definitily needs a guide without it, you will not understand history and the beautiful story of the long room An experience to absolutely live if you go to Dublin. This place full of history is incredibly beautiful and interesting. It was a stop in time for me. I took the time to linger in each room and contemplate and marvel at the history of the Book of Kells, the emblem of Ireland and Gaia, a breathtaking work visible in the long room. The staff is incredibly nice (like everywhere else here). Ill be back But your tickets in advance! Its a self guided tour but there are some staff members around to answer some questions, but not many. Extremely interesting but extremely crowded. Not easy to get around inside so be patient. The place with 3 Irish treasures, the Original Book of Kells (A illustration filled Gospel from the 9th century), the harp that Ireland based its national emblem on and original proclamation of Indpendence from 1916. You also visit the historical library (half empty due to restoration work) and see Gaia (a giant globe). Strongly recommend buying tickets in advance. It is a good experience but the price is higher than similar things at Dublin for the experience you get (25 for regular and 20 discounted), especially since you cant even get too close to the book of kells. The visual history of the book of kells is nice. Gift shop is very good with decent prices and helpful staff. This is one of the required tourist events in Dublin. Most of the volumes in the library are gone right now due to a construction project. There is, however,  a large illuminated globe rotating in the main gallery. The Book of Kells is a terrific experience for the person of faith but youll enjoy it more if you go when the crowds are lighter. This is located in the library at the Trinity College in Dublin.  The Book of Kells is a manuscript that depicts the four Gospels of the Bible with stunning attention to detail.   Plan your visit accordingly as there are a lot of visitors to this experience."
176,The Cake Cafe,4.55,"Nice cafe behind the book shop, you can also enter this cafe from the Pleasants Place / Street. It serves a variety of cakes and also main dish. We ordered a lemon cake and coffee cake, tastes really great and it really compliment the drink that we order at the time (Ice latte and ice cappuccino). The outdoor seating usually full of people so it is recommended you do your reservation if you want to come. Lovely small cafe hidden behind the bookstore. Food was amazing at a reasonable price but the service was a little slower. Staff were lovely and the atmosphere was pleasant. Fantastic hidden cafe on Camden Street. Great selection of cakes and coffees with a super brunch/lunch menu available as well. The staff are on the edge of Uber cool and, while service is not super fast it is well worth the extra time. For those rarer days when sunshine is both abundant and warm, there is some great outdoor seating. Put it on the list! I took my mom here for afternoon tea to celebrate her birthday while we visited London. The surroundings are simple, but I loved the atmosphere. There s a great outdoor seating space which we couldn t use because of the rain, but it was so beautiful to walk through. I tried the roasted vegetable sandwich, which was amazing. We shared a cake plate, and a pot of tea. Everything was so delicious!! On top of that, our waitress really went above and beyond and gave us incredible service the entire time we were there. Highly recommend if you have a chance to go! I popped in to the Cake Cafe last Saturday looking for a table for one. There was a bit of a wait outside but because the staff were so kind, accommodating, and warm it went by super quickly and I was eventually seated and enjoyed my breakfast! Food is always good and fresh and David the manager/owner makes you feel as though you re having coffee at his own home :) Located behind a bookshop (you need to enter The Last Bookshop and go out the back door), it s like entering a little oasis.  Their carrot cake, chocolate and brownie are really good (the cake tester plate less so, so I wish there had been the option of choosing which 3 cakes you d like to try). Unfortunately the food has been inconsistent the past couple of times I ve visited. The poached eggs were a disaster - it was as far from perfectly oozy as you can possibly get, with the yolk crumbling as if it had been boiled for a solid 10min. The neighbouring table was the same. We were treated graciously by the staff when we notified them at the end of our meal. A simple timer for the eggs and checking in on tables would go a long way in fixing such issues. Hard to find little breakfast cafe is worth hunting down! Google maps will get you there but it s down a quiet alley with one very small handmade sign on the gate. The food here is fantastic!  Also coffees and teas and baked goods including cakes and lemon bars.  Oh man I m getting hungry again writing this review! We ate breakfast, then bought some baked treats to go.  (The chocolate ganache cake didn t make it to the end of the block) A return visit, but a disappointing one. Long wait before being served, more than 20mins. Food OK but not worth the wait, as there are plenty more options in the area. Great cafe! The atmosphere is very welcoming, the staff are kind and very helpful, the only downside (and its not that bad) is the wait, but coming at a busy time, it is completely underdtandable. The food is delicious and compensates more than enough for the wait! I ordered a coffee walnut cake with chocolate ganache for my husbands birthday. It was delicious, and the staff were incredibly accommodating with my request. Very good experience overall! Such a beautiful setting to wile away an afternoon with great food, delicious cake and fantastic staff. One thing that really struck me is how happy all the staff seem, theyre like a bunch of friends welcoming you into their tea party. Gorgeous garden area and the bathroom is nicer than my entire apartment ;) We got here right at open and it wasnt that crowded. That being said, I could see this place filling up and having quite the wait for how good it was. It took them a while to get our order but thats because they were busy making all of the cakes for the morning, which was really awesome to see We wanted a massive hurry and so it really actually added to the whole experience and value I ended up getting the pancakes which tasted different than Im used to. The syrup that they used was less sweet but had so much better flavor. An interesting thing that I havent come across My wife ended up getting some poached egg on an open-faced bread and that was awesome as well My wife also has very strict dietary restrictions and the cake cafe did an incredible job making sure that they listed all of their allergens early and often on there menu and on all of their cakes Its just such a nice touch for us personally because normally it always seems like such a headache, but the cake cafe took the time ahead of time so we didnt have to ask about eight different items It might seem like such a small thing, but it means so much whenever we go out to eat I could see this place in the spring and summer being an incredible place to sit outside in the alleyway drinking your coffee or eating your small piece of cake This hidden gem was as gorgeous as it looks just as advertised on Instagram  . We came for brunch and absolutely loved it. The food is cooked so well and the staff and so lovely. Cant wait to bring my other group of friends here. Definitely a must do especially with the weather being so lovely. We are very big fans of Google! With Google you find very special places that you would not have found without Google. And this is one of them! The weather outside was really frightful, but the people and ambiance was so delightful. We came in from extreme rain, lightning and thunder lashes. Inside there was an oase of tranquility of people working, talking, enjoying and being themselves. It is a small but lovely place where you get an honest and completely self made lunch. Even though my double espresso became a ristretto and was a tag cold, it is forgiven. It tasted perfect. We took a whole included lunch for 30,-/prs: the afternoon lunch. It is served on a tray of plates with a savoury plate of home made sandwiches on home made bread, with e.g. homemade cream and home made jam/jello. There was some salad with a really nice dressing, so don t ignore that. Your dessert-plate is in the meanwhile waiting for you on top. First you might think, no two of everything, but as you start you realize that you are forced to get romantisch and share. There are some lovely tables outside (see pictures), but the weather was just too bad. Even the toilet is very special. It shows an expression of honest and truthful tolerance and respect on its own. We had an excellent afternoon tea and we strongly recommend this little gem. We got our wedding cake from the cake cafe and it was amazing! One tier was carrot cake and the other was chocolate biscuit cake, both of which were delicious, all of our guests were raving about it! Weve recommended them to so many people, youll not be disappointed. Special thanks to David who we dealt with and was so helpful in organising everything! Cafe is hidden between a small alley and the old bookshop. It has a great outdoor seating and a comfortable place inside. All dishes we had there were very tasty and felt very much homemade. The selection of cakes is small but they all look great. Our visit was topped by a visit of tiny dog called Bernie from the next door book shop. I dont know how I have never heard of this place but this is a true hidden gem. Great tasty toasts and very nice cakes. We went here for brunch and spent around 18 euros including drink (toast and drink). The portions are really big, so you get a good  full  start in your day. Vegetarian options: Good menu for vegan and vegetarians. I was really hoping brunch here will be memorable, but it was as mediocre as it can be. Food (2/5): plain scrambled eggs, bacon, uninspiring egg. At least reasonable value for money in terms of quantity. Overall, the Chef Special was nothing but special... :( Coffee (1/5): burnt flavor of coffee, and too much milk for a macchiato. Service (5/5): superb, attentive, mind. Vibe (4/5): cool design, not loud, but a bit too dense in terms of spreading the table around. I reckon that they want to optimise for maximum clients, which is understandable. TRY THE CHORIZO! The cake cafe is somewhere that if you didnt know was there, you might never find it. hen you do, your entire day is a little be brighter. You can get to the cake cafe either by going THROUGH the last bookshop directly on Camden (which is worth a visit in of itself, just to see the resident doggo, Bertie) OR you can take the side road and get there that way as well. When you enter the courtyard, you will be captivated by the my secret garden atmosphere and instantly feel at ease. You have your choice of either outside tables or inside. Both are lovely, but you have the chance of getting to pet a wonderful dog! This pet friendly place is no strangers to dogs, and provides water for the weary woolly traveling companion that you may find with their human entourage. Clearly, outdoor is the only option. One day down and situated, the friendly staff will give you a menu, one which includes mimosas, your choice of coffee, or some wine if youre in the mood. The menu is short but sweet, and gives you a pretty great variety to go through. I asked the waitress what her favourite was, which led to me getting the smashed Avocado on toast. As the meat glutten that I am, I couldnt pass up the chorizo, so I had that added on! BOY WAS THAT THE BEST IDEA EVER. The food came out pretty quickly, and prepared to perfection. The toast was perfectly cooked, the ingredients were fresh, and the avocado was perfect. The chorizo was a great addition to add a bit of spice to it, which to me, rounded out the dish perfectly. Ill never not get their chorizo again. IT WAS THAT GOOD. The flat white was fine as well. To be harsh, I wouldnt say its the best coffee Ive had in Dublin, but it was prepared beautifully, the coffee wasnt burnt, and the coffee to milk ratio  for my flat white was on point! So overall, it was great! Im incredibly snobby and critical when it comes to coffee, so my fine is likely very very good for normal humans. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this place. Stunningly perfect food, coupled with great customer service, great atmosphere, great coffee and overall great experience. My dog and I will definitely be coming here more, and would absolutely recommend this place to others! Food is homemade and very tasty. Dont recommend to go at 12.00 since it is when the cafe is at its busiest and service might be a bit chaotic. Other than that, its a nice little hidden gem which you enter through a bookshop. Very trendy looking. Their French toast special is an absolute must. Coffee is pretty decent too. Lovely cafe with friendly staff in the most beautiful hidden location behind a The Last Bookshop. I had the Potato Farl which was up there as one of the tastiest meals I ve had!, all the different flavours worked so well together in a scrumptious taste explosion! The cake slice I got for my 5 year old was a little overpriced at  4.80 but it seems that this is becoming the norm everywhere? A very cosy place. We had smashed peas on toast and buttermilk pancakes whith poached fruits. Really tasty. Nice coffees and soft drinks too. Highly recommended this place. Super nice cafeteria a bit hidden from one of the main road of the citycenter. There are two entrances, one from a library in camden street and the other in a little lane behind. Enjoyable and cosy the little garden, the cakes are tasty and there is a variety of different coffees. I tried the bicerin. Highly recommended I don t recommend this cafe at all. Although the staff were nice, the service I got was terrible! I ordered a piece of sponge cake which was not fresh at all. They brought my coffee first and served the cake after 25 minutes!!! My coffee got cold and tasteless!!! . I won t recommend this cafe! Really love this cafe. Beautiful set-up, location is gorgeous (like a green festival-like oasis in the middle of the city), with welcoming atmosphere (feminist ethos and LGBTQ friendly). However, I was disappointed by the Goats Cheese & Mediterranean Vegetabe sandwich I got, especially for the price. The bread was cut too thick, meaning it was a very dry sandwich as the ratio of bread to filling was nearly 3:1!  The goats cheese was plopped in the middle of the sandwich, so that most bites were just veg. I got Mayo to make it less dry. After being a waitress so many times over the years,  I have a high but fair standard of what good service entails. The server was perhaps new, and so inexperienced, but despite the restaurant being not that full, I had to go up and ask for a refill of water and it took them a long time to take my plate away when empty. Would still highly recommend and perhaps other lunch foods are better. The cakes always look delicious! Great little gem of a cafe. Old skool tables. Old skool Delph. Formica tables. Staff are spot on and very accommodating..the smell of fresh bakes and cakes. Devine.and if you sit outside   . Nice cafe hidden away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Its really pleasant to sit and relax in the artistic courtyard on a sunny day. We enjoyed coffee and cake, both good, only complaint was the size of the coffee cups, a little small. The staff are very friendly. Cutest little brunch place and bakery with delicious food. Classic brunch but with a twist. Lots of vegan / vegetarian options. MUST try the scones This is a cute cafe in Kevin Street. You can enter the cafe from a book store. The quality of their cakes is amazing. The have good snack options. Small place, so you might have to wait until you find a table. Adorable cafe. I wish they had some heat lamps outside because we did get really cold. I ordered the Christmas Special and I was a bit disappointed - it was small, and a bit too much bread and little filling... My friends green Goddess eggs looked delicious though. The brownie was very good. Lovely brunch with interesting tea and coffee options, including a spiced tea and the Bicerin! Lovely eggs in toasted bread with butter and awesome pancakes. Absolutely recommended, but you could have to wait to be seated. What a hidden gem. We went on a recommendation and we weren t disappointed. Really friendly staff and the meal I had was to die for. Certainly one of the best light brunch dishes I have ever tasted. I so recommended this place. Little bit slow, the place IS small. Food was ok... Nice place for brunch Food : 3/5 Updated: dropped in for a coffee with partner and child in stroller so sat outside. Coffees first were great, decided to get the chorizo scramble but wanted to share. No issues and the dish was served on two separate plates. A nice touch, and good service as it should be. It was delish. Then for the carrot cake again split and it came with two plates if we wanted to split. Really wanted to just highlight the good service. Hard to find these days. Great work guys. We were there as the place opened and we had the full cafe to ourselves. Funny to say the atmosphere was good with no one there, but the music and the sounds of the staff working away getting ready for the day generated a warm cosy feeling. Food was great, very tasty and large portions. Coffee was offered first thing as we perused the menu always nice to be attended to straight away. Impressive cafe with excellent staff and great food and coffee. Cant complain do wont, Id recommend obviously and we will be back Very cozy place, the stuff is really nice  . We had french toast, carrots and walnuts pancakes and granola yogurt. Highly recommend the pancakes and the granola, it was so good!! Cake Cafe was amazing. It has what so many cafes in Dublin lack; a unique twist with its dishes. Sitting outside felt Covid-safe and staff were sensible with masks. Great coffee. Great food. Great brunch. Will be back! Good food, great vibe, fun drinks, and a good spot for brunch. Only feedback I have is there could have been more non-dairy, or vegan options as these seemed limited (just the 1 dessert, and a couple of dishes) Ive been hearing about this place for some time and today I decided to try it. Unfortunately Ive been ignored by the 4 (might have been 5) staff. Ive waited at the counter, and waited, and waited...while everyone walked around and joked. Ive walked out and still no one said a thing. Even  if everyone is busy, you tell the customer you will be with them in a minute (5, 10, 20) you dont ignore them. Update: When you manage to get a table the food is great! Second time down this week. very nice staff and great coffee, would definitely recommend (Order an iced latte!!) Food a sweet surprised walking thru The Last Bookshop in Camden Street and on its back door hidden this cute, little cafe. bamboo plants welcome you on the way to this lovely, super chill space thats perfect for a quick bite during lunch breaks, or a long catch-up with friends. staffs are very accommodating. food is superb. cake is just wow. highly! highly recommended.."
177,The Coffee Bean,4.9,"It was a beautiful experience to be able to go outside and get a dose of healthy breakfast early in the morning while surfing Dublin as a tourist. The staff is very courteous and the space is super cozy. So many options for which we kept going back on our 3 day trip. The oatmeal, avocado toast was spectacular and had us full even after lunch time. Thanks for your service :) Great spot just off Capel Street. A few tables outsibe but also small inside.. 4 5  tables, very limited. The coffee is great and the cakes. We didnt try food but the kitchen looked very busy so I guess the food is good. Next time were gonna try the food. Big minus is that I didnt see any toilets in the premises. I didnt ask but the space is so small and Im pretty sure I would have seen it. My old barman/waiter instinct from the years I spent in the hospitality industry kicked in when I saw the way the chocolate was sprinkled over our coffees. It looked like someone dropped it accidentally. Sorry guys but I couldnt not notice that.. No big deal. The staff is super nice though. My favorite coffee shop in Dublin! Best coffee in town, amazing brunch options, lovely atmosphere, amazing staff! 10/10 Vegetarian options: That have vegetarian dishes Amazing find. Delicious brunch, superb staff, so accommodating for us when we walked in with a large group. Very affordable! Definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area A charming little cafe on a busy street. You can, of course, quickly pop in for a hit of java and be gone but the richer experience takes time. I ordered the Dubliner and what came out was a plate of tasty goodness. It consisted of Sausages, Bacon, Fried or Scrambled Eggs, Baked Beans, Mushrooms and Toast. The view from the window allows you to watch the world pass by as you nibble on your fry-up. Another good word on the opening hours of 7:45 am on the weekdays. This is to be welcomed as too many cafes in Dublin open after the breakfast hour has been and gone. Really cosy and lovely friendly atmosphere. Loved the coffee and brunch. My election was veggie brunch. Ideal when when you want to be alone and need some warmth in youre heart. Vegetarian options: Baggel and brunch and some sandwiches. Excellent small cafe in a very multicultural area of Dublin, and a find of convenience (i.e. wanted a coffee, but no multinational chain). Small, but with very enthusiastic personnel. Very good mocchachino, and probably the best sausage roll (home made, not from the freezer) in Dublin. I would give this place 10 stars if I could! The food here is amazing and the staff is incredible! We stayed in Dublin for two weeks and came here for breakfast nearly every day because the food was that good! I highly recommend this cafe! The staff made us feel so welcome and at home. We can t wait to come back on our next trip! Amazing food. We went there three times during our six day visit. Porridge, Breakfast Bagel, Avocado Toast. Anything I would order tasted incredible. Definitely recommend going there. On top we felt very welcomed accommodating us with a toddler in a great atmosphere. We didnt try the food. We only had coffee. The place was very busy. We ordered a latte and a cappuccino. Both coffees were just OK. I certainly wouldnt recommend this place for coffee but I cant comment on the food. The dishes we saw looked interesting. Our breakfast was super delicious and the staff really nice and friendly. This was defenitely worth that Finnish chocolate I gave you, I hope you guys liked it! I took my friends to try this new place called Coffee Bean. We ordered a couple of things, including French toast pancakes omelettes and vegetable breakfas. We also ended up ordering coffee coffee and hot chocolate, and its overall a nice place its located in the middle of the city, and it was very crowded. The thing was that the ingredients were fresh. I liked the vegetable breakfast it had avocados it had a Ricardos mushrooms, eggs, and hash Brown hash Brown, and I would definitely be coming back. Good and yummy food, fair prices and perfectly located. Nice and friendly people working here. The coffee is good, couldve been a bit stronger (for my personal taste) but all in all very recommendable. Lovely staff, great food and fantastic location, if you want to pop in for breakfast, lunch or just a coffee. They also have a number of gluten free options, which is a bonus. Dietary restrictions: Gluten free options available on request if you are looking for a place to have breakfast its perfect, we had a great time, nothing to say, the staff is very friendly Quaint street side coffee shop that serves up a delicious breakfast/brunch as well as a good cup of Java. Friendly staff, great food, outstanding cup of coffee, and out under the open sky- what more could one ask for while on holiday? Food is really why I came to Dublin. This was amazing and the staff is soooooo nice !! 100% recommend. The fluffiest pancakes ever. There s pesto with the avocado toast, I was a bit surprised but it ended up being one of the best one I ve ever had. Definitely going back my next time ! Fabulous little cafe on Mary Street. Breakfast is absolutely fantastic and I would recommend the French toast and also the four way pancakes or today I had scrambled eggs on toast, could not fault the food in any way, always cooked fresh and everything including the kitchen is spotless clean.  Staff are very professional and will do everything to make you feel comfortable and welcome. To anyone looking for breakfast,  lunch or even a coffee, I would recommend going out of your way to visit here. Honestly the best breakfast in Dublin and very reasonably priced. 5 Star       well done guys. Excellent breakfast, very good pastries and a perfect latte. Definitely a good choice for breakfast, coffee or a quick snack. Foods priced very well and would definitely recommend Adorable place with many options for breakfast/brunch/lunch. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. Reasonable prices too. Definitely recommend! The coffee bean has that rare experience of making you feel at home somewhere, away from all the trendy overpriced nonsense that is so common everywhere else in town. The food is great. I recommend the Irish breakfast and the Tuna Melt. The cheesecake is also amazing. Wonderful staff and great customer service. Always friendly and cheerful. Combined with an ideal location just off Capel street makes the Coffee bean the best Cafe on the North Side of Dublin. Thanks you guys! Always enjoy Coco s wonderful hospitality & friendliness in a lovely setting. The coffee, breakfast, cakes & cinnamon rolls are some of the most delicious. Staff here always welcome you with a smile. Visited Dublin for a small city break and made sure we had breakfast there every day. Prices very reasonable for the amount of food you are getting and very nice service. Highly recommended! Good and cost effective food in the heart of Dublin. I always prefer that place when I am in the city center. Bonus some tables outside for the sunny days. Lovely cafe ! Great cakes and coffee ! Can be busy ! Little coffee shop with absolutely friendly and lovely staff and delicious food. We had breakfast, which was made freshly and of great quality. I had a bread with avocado, salmon and egg with a really delicious dressing. Wonderful. Great place for brunch or lunch.  The prices are fair and the staff are very pleasant! The portions are generous and the products are quality! I would happily go back I get my morning coffee and breakfast here most mornings as I work close by. Im always greeted with a smile by the friendly staff. The coffee and food is always great and its always an easy decision to return for more. Mgmt and staff are a credit to themselves! Had a quick bite on a Sunday morning/afternoon here. The place was packed yet service and food came quickly, all customers seemed to be in a nice mood with great vibes what says how good the food was (very tasty!) and for a good price too. All-in-all, a great experience. Yummy buttermilk pancakes and friendly staff! What a little gem of a place!!!!Service and staff super friendly. Food was beautiful and well presented. A lovely ambience to the place. Beats hands down having a hotel breakfast! What a pretty and sweet Cafe, the staff is so nice and all food a delicious and fresh. One of the best is the Tina melt... and the cakes .... Thank you for the good time, su :) Food : 5/5 I just had a brunch with my best friend there and we simply loved the place, the food, every single detail. Also, the staff are so nice, they work with love and patience. Definitely one of our favs now. It is our second time in Dublin and second time visiting this place. The food is freshly made, they had excellent choice of vegan food, we had freshly squeezed orange juice, everything was amazing!! The staff is very friendly and welcoming! Couldnt recommend more! Will be back for sure! Great cafe to pop in for a quick breakfast. French toast was lovely and the crispy bacon was the star of the plate! I enjoyed the outdoor dining area to watch the morning hustle of Mary Street as I relaxed. Popped in for a quick coffee! The interiors are well done up and the music goes well with the setup creating a lovely atmosphere. The coffee is good as well! Atmosphere Great little breakfast and coffee spot. Very solid Irish breakfast. Very nice place! Lovely coffee and delicious food served by a very friendly and fully professional staff. Highly recommended! Really delicious food and good coffee, at a small premises that you might miss on this busy side street. Worth calling in though - the grilled chicken ciabatta was especially delicious! Great, this little place!  perfect for breakfast, tasty dishes, super welcoming staff, cool music...we went back several times with the same pleasure."
178,The Famine Memorial,4.9,"Very thought provoking and emotional memorial to the Great Hunger. The statues are very well made and their looks make you feel anxious and grateful for what you have. The historic Famine Mural is a poignant and visually striking testament to Irelands past. The murals detailed artwork skillfully captures the emotions and struggles of a significant period in history. Located in [specific location], it serves as a powerful reminder of resilience and the importance of acknowledging our shared heritage. The murals vivid depiction and historical significance make it a must-see for both locals and visitors interested in Irelands rich cultural tapestry. There is an incredible monument, the human figures represent the great famine caused by the potato disease, between 1845 and 1849. About two million people died and another two million emigrated from the island. A work of art accessible from the street not far from the museum grocery store. It hits the guts and makes us think about Irish history Sad to read and also very sad that are so many criminals in this area targeting tourist. Very moving momument to the Irish Famine. The structures of various people and a dog. Stands on the river near the docks. Definitely should visit. A readerboard is also there with a description of the event in Irish history. Still very much present in the national psyche of Ireland: the heart rendering Famine Memorial in Dublin lets one share a glimpse of the pain and sorrow the people of this country experienced not too long ago. Definitely worth a visit. Very well done sculptures. One of the first groups of emigrants took this path on March 17, 1846, on St. Patricks Day. A very touching memorial that summarizes the Irish potato famine in the 1850 s.  These striking statues are poignant, and are moving as well a testament of what happened..  there is no charge to come and view these statues, which overlook the Liffey river. The gaunt, eerie faces and shadows is always a heartbreaking reminder of the famine times. Definitely recommend, if you have the time visiting The tall Ship famine boat (50mins tour) and (Epic 2hrs) together to get some more insight to the stories of some of the Irish people history of the famine. A sad reminder of some of the dark days in Irelands history. The Great Famine also known as the Great Hunger, was a period of starvation and disease in Ireland from 1845 to 1849. The worst year of the period was 1847, known as Black 47. During the Great Hunger, roughly a million people died and more than a million fled the country, causing the countrys population to fall by 20 25%. Lets hope by looking after our planet with the technology and knowledge we now have we never ever see dark days like this ever again. Its sometimes easy to let the past slip away and get caught up in the city and hustle of modern life. This monument serves as a reminder of the past and the trials and tribulations those who came before us faced. The realism and expressions on the statues faces really pull you in and allow you to connect on an emotional level to the events of the past Very touching memorial. To visit passing by while walking around the city Die Hungersnot von 1845 - 1849 zeigte, wie grausam Kapitalismus war und ist. Geld ist mehr wert als Menschenleben. The famine of 1845-1849 showed how cruel capitalism was and is.  Money is worth more than human lives. The hambruna of 1845-1849 showed that the cruel era was capitalism.  The food is worth more than human lives. The famine of 1845-1849 showed how cruel capitalism was and is.  Money is worth more than human lives. Beautiful and intriguing monument. It captures the emotions and the impact of the Famine quite well, very touching. I do think it deserves a more quiet place though in stead of next to this busy road. Id like it if it were in Stephens green park for example, so you can really have the rest and peace to look at it in silence. This really opens your eyes to what the Irish went through during the potato famine and how the English responded. Moving. Maybe it s the touch of Irish I have in my genetics. Or maybe it s because I just come from a almost Third World country where I saw incredible wealth and people picking through through trash. I love art, I love art in public on the street even more, and especially when a city will put such works of art in special places like the Riverwalk. An easy stop; and perhaps more importantly an important reminder that we re all humans and we all need to help each other once in a while. Bad things can happen to anyone .. the world would be so much better if we looked out for one another a tad more often. as you stroll by the liffey river, youd see this memorial that commemorates the lives lost during the potato famine. the statues are no longer well maintained though; i hope the local government would be able to preserve them better. please read the story behind it, heartbreaking and one for the books in irish history. it reminded me of the monument, shoes by the danube in budapest. Wow.. superb place, sculptures are amazing.. Day time and night.. love it.. all details and emotions .. A very tragic and powerful memorial about the events that happened to the Irish people, namely the potato famine. The monument is a clear testimony to Irelands difficult past. About a million people died in the famine, and another million emigrated.  As a result, the Irish population was greatly reduced. The monument is very detailed and captures the struggles and emotions of this period in Irish history, while at the same time serving as a powerful reminder of the importance of a shared heritage. We were on a tour of the city, and when they told us about this monument we just wanted to cry. If you appreciate history and specifically the history of Ireland, it s worth checking out. Simple yet beautiful memorial that conveys the pain through haunting statues. Very succinct but poignant memorial, too bad there arent more explanatory tables. Great artwork. Worth a walk by and it did encourage me to research the history of the famine. Quite sad. We didn t have time to go to the museum or onboard the boat but I would have liked to The Famine Sculptures are a stark reminder to us of the fortunate time we live in and sheer misery of those who had to endure the great famine. The sculptures features several malnourished figures, some clutching equally malnourished babies and children. The sculptures are haunting, as it should be. A sad, but important reminder of The Famine Poignant, haunting memorial to the famine inflicted on our country that cost millions of lives and was then swept under the carpet. This was the finishing point for our National Famine Walk from Strokestown, Co Roscommon in memory of the 1490 tenants who were forcefully evicted in 1847. Over half of them died during the crossing in coffin ships enroute to Quebec. A sad remind of a very tragic event in Ireland s history. The Famine Memorial was installed in homage to the victims of the Great Famine, which heavily affected Ireland from 1845 to 1849, this group of sculptures depicts starving Irish people in rags, struggling on the pavement. Created in 1997 by the Dublin sculptor Rowan Gillepsie, this work is a strong symbol for the city of Dublin. A beautiful way to remember the history that shaped Ireland, while keeping the memories alive on the very quays of Dublin. Nearly missed it and walked past it, particularly subtle but when youve noticed it and read the plaques on the floor it very much hits home, the statues are particularly haunting but get the historical message across. Bone chilling, well worth a visit. They really managed to capture the severe impact of the famine. A lot of effort and work was put into explaining this very difficult part of Irish history. Beautiful area next to water with museums close by. Short walk to several cafes and restaurants As they say, a picture says 1000 words.  In this case this memorial captures the great suffering of the Irish people during the famine. The Famine Memorial tells the sad Irish history of the  Great Famine  that saw more than half of the Irish population emigrate to the diaspora. This memorial bears the suffering of a whole generation. The Great Hunger of 1847 had left scars that could not be washed away by the Liffey River. Its an amazing monument that represent one of the most dramatic moment in the irish history. The atmosphere that one breathes in the place makes one understand exactly the pain experienced by these people who have been forced to abandon their land and embark on an uncertain destiny. I personally recommend it. Hauntingly memorable. Could not take photos, it felt disrespectful to do so. They conveyed so much anguish. Definitely worth a visit, since its likely on your way to the EPIC or the Jeanie Johnston.  Sobering would be the best word i could give it, especially if you know the history. An interesting, exciting sculpture and it was interesting to know the history A very moving memorial to those who left Ireland during the Famine. The pain and despair is etched on the faces of the sculpture. It takes up quite a large space and you can see it up close. There is a family of seven and their dog. There is an equivalent statue in Toronto with five figures, apparently. The hardship did not end after leaving Dublin. There was something morbidly fascinating about these. Sad but well done The Great Famine of Ireland is memorialized in many locations throughout Ireland, especially in those regions that suffered the greatest losses, and also in cities overseas with large populations descended from Irish immigrants. Very moving memorial to those killed by the famine.  Board with details of Famine victim pilgrimage,  way marked by bronze sculptures of childrens shoes. Nice walk and came across these beautiful statues about the terrible famine in Ireland"
179,The Fumbally,4.85,"We first came here for a coffee and pastry to go and returned for a late lunch just because the food looked awesome. We got the cauliflower panini and the beans on toast. Super tasty! We also had a blueberry donut which was out of this world and super stuffed with jam! And an almond croissant Lovely and helpful staff, the atmosphere and decor is so beautiful to look at, and the food was incredible! I had a triple cheese toastie of some kind and these amazing beans with parmesan        absolutely divine. I also asked to leave some posters for our event, and they were very obliging. Vegetarian options: Decent options available and they always seem very accommodating A super cool cafeteria/farmers shop. Loved the vibe and all the pictures on the walls. The coffee wasn t the best. Took Fumbally eggs and it tasted great and kept my stomach full for the entire day! The places amazing, and they deal with ingredients of proximity from small granges. Very fun atmosphere with unique decor.  The veggie sandwich special of the day was delicious.  The chai tea was expensive considering it was served in the same small glass as the short water glasses. The family style table for solos and duos was nice.  I was surprised when the server cleared the dishes from the previous customers at the communal table and then directed new customers to sit at the table, and they didnt wipe or disinfect the table in any way. I watched them do this twice while I ate my sandwich.  It was a little surprising in 2024. I love that they have a little shop and take away area.  Overall cute place with a delicious sandwich. A real hidden (maybe not so hidden?) gem in Dublin, especially for tourists. Honestly one of the best breakfast Ive ever had. Not only is the location super cute and decorated, the food is exceptional as is the coffee and staff, and for a really great price. I had the Tuscan beans (ate there 4 years ago) and still look for a similar recipes to try and replicate at home. If youre looking for a new breakfast joint, make sure you check out this place! It is cute, just like all the other hipster habitats globally. You will never know if you are in Dublin, Berlin, Paris, London, or Brooklyn in 2007.  It is like going to hipster McDonald s, you know what you will get and it is trustworthy. Locally produced and more expensive food in a very artsy setting. You feel good about yourself consuming all of this. You don t mind paying for locally made lip balm that is way more expensive than ones from supermarkets but hey, it is vegan. All jokes aside, it is cute. When you are not sure where to go for good food and cute atmosphere, look for hipster cafe like this. Way better than some other touristy restaurants. Also great for people watching. Amazing place with chill atmosphere, also great for coworking. Next time will bring my laptop to work here Note: the kitchen is open until 15pm Vegetarian options: Most of dishes are vegetarian Had been here recently with friends for a brunch and had a great experience. The staff were nice and kind, the presentation was good and the food was awesome. Special mention to their fresh yummy sourdough - which I bought a loaf home as well. Overall a nice place, conveniently located, good food and ambiance! Should try! Coffee shop with impeccable quality/price ratio. We eat really well there, fresh produce, top-notch sourdough bread, generous foccacia, delicious filled donuts. Communal tables, smiling service Probably my favorite coffee spot in Dublin :) Tasty coffee, delicious treats and lovely staff ! Don t be afraid to wait a little bit for brunch on the week ends, it s worth it Food : 5/5 Fabulous food to dine it or takeaway combined with eclectic gift items in a warm and welcoming environment. Perfect for breakfast or lunch. I was walking on that street looking for coffee and saw many people inside this place, I continued walkimg but outside it was a guy with an amazimg bread, I decided to go in.  I had my coffe, a croisant and a lastel de nata to die for. Everything delicious!!!!! Glad I went in, Im leaving Duvlin Tuesday and so sorry place is closed Sunday and Monday. Favourite Cafe in Dublin for atmosphere and gourmet groceries! Love the crew here and can happily sit at the window for a few hours working away, having chats and drinking coffee. Friends of friends of friends always passing through. My favourites on the menu are the mixed salad bowl and the soup. Tuscan Beans also a winner plus any of their sweet stuff or breads. Value for money would be 3 stars but 5 for everything else and paying that little extra for the atmosphere makes it feel worthwhile Super cute brunch spot and great local grocery store! Beans on toast had me in happy tears. And I m debating moving to Dublin for that focaccia . Pros: Delicious Fumbally Eggs + Eye catching interior design Cons: - One of the best spots in dublin 8 for breakfast / brunch. With a farm to plate concept, the fumbally serves up both classics and originals until 4/5 pm in the evening. It s also an event space and a market of sorts. I ve tried the bread and some veg, both of which were excellent. Cool, funky, original, and great value for money! Can take some time to get a table on a weekend but it s worth the wait. Nice combination of a small market place for fresh and organic food and delicacies and a tiny restaurant. It was quite crowded so we had to wait for 20-30 minutes, but the authentic homemade fresh and delicious meals were worth waiting. The Fumbally seems to have an open and airy vibe yet still feeling cozy with the large shared table in the centre of the seating area. I had the tuscan beans with an egg on top and it was amazing. Well spiced and seasoned, and a perfect amount of cheese on a thick slice of sourdough bread. Good portions and delicious. It is very rustic place with nice coffee and breakfast and it everything so fresh and delicious , they have a little market inside that I am sure I go back to buy some things, staff are very kind and the atmosphere is good. Vegetarian options: They have salad and risoto options Kid-friendliness: They have chairs for kids The Fumbally is outstanding! The market has brilliantly curated local delights that support the community. The cafe has a mouthwatering menu and sensational coffee. The staff were so friendly and welcoming and the customers contributed to the chill vibes. I would eat and shop there every day if I could. This is an amazing spot. You can sit in for breakfast/brunch and it also has amazing coffee. The food and the space are sort of rustic/hipster and there s an indoor farmer s market as well. Their sourdough bread is the nicest in Dublin.    They do seem slightly understaffed and the floor staff seem to be running around trying to keep up. Coffees and orders can take a little longer to arrive but overall, totally worth a visit. The Fumbally is a very genuine and unique place, with a relaxed atmosphere. Great coffee and treats but in my opinion what makes the difference is the daily specials for lunch. You can find dishes from different places: more common as Japan, Spain and Italy or as not that common in Ireland as Ethiopian cuisine (and many more) What a treasure to find. Local fresh products and great tasting food. Indoor and outdoor seating. A must if in the area. An absolute gem. Delicious food, wonderful atmosphere, and lovely staff! The best rye cake Ive ever had!! My favourite brunch spot in Dublin ! Fresh organic produce amazing staff perfect coffee atmosphere is super relaxed hippie chic excellent service food super tasty fresh and filling! Community centered space, delicious organic veg food, super friendly service. And reasonably priced. Loved it, highly recommend. Lovely spacious place in a great area. Close to the city center, but less busy and quite relaxed. Visited for the first time and will be coming back again for sure! Staff is friendly and really willing to help with any of your requests. I went for classics: scrambled eggs on sourdough with kale and hot sauce + flat white, both were excellent. An impressive variety of fresh pastry made me leaving with a roasted coconut cruffin, which was the best treat of the weekend so far. Thank you, Fumbally Cool vibe, super friendly people, tasty brunch and its has so many special and healthy product what you cant find everywhere. The Fumbally may well be related to Bread 41, Lilliput, Lotts & Co., Blas Cafe - if you like any of those places youll love it here! I generally just drop in to get a wee loaf of bread, which in my opinion has replaced Bread 41 in terms of quality and flavour, and a few treats. Big plus for separating the space into a shop and cafe area. For folks like myself who mostly drop in to pick up a few things youll be able to skip the lengthy queues. On the flipside The Fumbally does feel pricey or pricier than other similar brunch hotspots. Totally a hipster place, but the food is really awesome! The restaurant is quite busy and youll probably have to share the table, but despite the crowd the waiters do a great job in serving you as fast as possible. I had the breakfast hash with black pudding (a nice discovery) and a slice of Basque cheesecake, they were amazing! The eggs and ham with avocado were also great. Served by a very friendly waiter. We had a lovely bowl of porridge and the meat focaccia of the day and would definitely return! Their little shop filled with Irish products, and breads and pastries baked freshly on-site is well worth a closer look too if you have the time - there seems to be something for everyone. Absolutely fantastic place!! Loved the food and the atmosphere!   100% recommend! It is shared tables so can get a bit busy around lunch time and there is very limited outdoor seating but the food is worth it! The food here is out of this world delicious! From the beans on toast to overnight oats the selections are hearty and flavorful. Service can be a bit slow, but it is worth the wait. Lovely selection of produce, baked goods and unique pantry items as well. My only disappointment is that we didn t try it earlier in our stay! Adorable place with much sunlight, staff was super cute and friendly as well:) The breakfast was okay. Urban atmosphere, feeling Irish. Its like a market with fresh and good coffee. Not that cheap! Food : 3/5 We came here with 2 vegetarians they loved the many choices delicious food fresh baked breads pastries and cakes that made our taste buds dance excellent coffee worth seeking out if you are in Dublin Vegetarian options: Many delicious vegetarian options Absolutely delicious, best vegan beans on toast we ever had! The Fumbally is a great location with several vegan options on their menu. The servers were super friendly and helpful, we actually came here twice during our four day stay because it was so great! The best brunch / lunch / cafe / local market spot in Liberties. Whether you are looking for a coffee on your own, or a nice place to share some food with friends  it s just the best. The food is always tasty, so flavoursome. Staff are always super friendly and helpful. And they always have good wine selection, even a small farmers market and some local and international delicatessen. Best place in Dublin 8! We came here around 2:30 pm and ordered the fumbally eggs, black coffee and orange juice. All were perfect and delicious. Go there, enjoy a wonderful authentic atmosphere and buy some local things. Definitely will come back."
180,The Garda Museum,4.7,"Small but a wonderful experience.  Lots of history about policing in Ireland.  That said it should take 20-30 minutes so see around but for an educated person with any interest at all it would be nearer one hour!  Totally free and I cannot recommebd it enough! Great Irish Police Museum, free museum like many in Dublin. I highly recommend it, exclusively in English Very interesting museum which describes the complicated history of the RIC and Garda. Lots to read, lots of artifacts. Perfect spot for history buffs and those who like to wander off the beaten track. Very good museum small but full of historians items On your way for a visit to Dublin Castle you meet this interesting Museum of Irelands National Police Service, surely deserving everyones respect and support. After checking their website to see if they were open or if I needed to book in advance, we arrived only to be told that they were closed without any notice. Very disappointing especially when you come with kids Lots of history. Very informative. Worth a visit. Great little museum. A well spent 30+ minutes. And its free.  We almost missed it because the door was locked. Found out you have to ring the bell to be buzzed in. Nice and intressting. Its also free But its a bit hard to find, the iron gate was closed when we arrived, but it was unlocked. But it made it look closed. Visited on Leaving Dublin Castle on the right we came across a sign indicating the entrance to the museum. Having time, we went there out of curiosity... well, this museum is worth stopping there and not just by chance. Made up of around twenty rooms, it traces the history of the police up to the present day and its evolution over the changes in Irish history. We spent a good hour there and didnt read everything. On the other hand, we had a lot of fun on the police motorcycle presented towards the end. Very clearly to do. But be careful, only in English Small free museum which traces the history of the Irish police. Nice little collection of uniforms and cool anecdotes written on the walls. Do not hesitate to visit via Dublin Castle. Quick and educational visit. Its a lovely small museum. It tells the Story of the gara very detailed and good Nice small museum with the history of the Garda. Free and right next to Dublin Castle. I advise you to visit this museum! dont forget to pre-register for the visit. Very interesting museum showing policing in Ireland from the 19th century to the modern day. Not well known about but worth a visit Excellent museum although the opening hours are somewhat limited. Lots of artefacts that bring you from the genesis of policing in Ireland up to the modern day Hard to find, next to the gift shop. I never saw a place like this before, but definitely something you have to see, if you are slightly interested in policing. Provides a lot of background information and focuses on the work of law enforcement and not politics. Found this place by accident when visiting Dublin Castle, loads to see and read about. Well worth a visit. Great little museum, could be quite easily missed as its tucked in the alley by the dublin castle gift shop. Would reccomend a visit if your interested in the Garda history. Its informative and if you like that. You will like it. I like and respect the Garda. They do a hard job. Glad there is a museum about their history. Museum well presented great to read up on  the history of the Gardai . Receptionist really friendly I liked the museum, its very beautiful! Exceptional exhibition showcasing the history and challenges of policing in Ireland. Beautiful building Best Experience Very cool garden where you can enjoy a nice rest Try to get there when its sunny you will love it Very good place to kids. Small, but still a lot to see. Verry helpfully people here. Thanks A wealth of information.  Thank you for all the assistance. Informative tour with some great exhibits. Unfortunately it looks like its permanently closed. Didnt get arrested, very disappointed Great place. Great experience Great experience Absolut empfehlenswert. Kleines, aber nett gemachtes Museum welches sich ausgiebig mit der Geschichte und der Entstehung der Irischen Polizei beschaftigt. Das Museum ist kostenlos. Der Eingang ist etwas schwer zu finden. Wenn geoffnet ist, dann steht dort ein kleiner Aufsteller des Museums. Man muss dann einen kleinen Gang entlang gehen und am Ende an einer verschlossen Tur klingeln. .    ,                ,                      .              , Najini 9-letni h erki je bil muzej v e .

181,The Gravedigger Bus Tour,3.6,"This tour was very fun and spooky   if youre not scared and love spooky stuff, then attending spooky entertainment is highly recommended. it was worth the money but theres a few small disadvantages,  the blood shot was an unknown syrup mixed with vodka, which wasnt very enjoyable in my personal opinion and personal taste, and the history tour outside of the bus wasnt as interesting as we didnt go inside the buildings we visited and just stood outside listening to the history which makes it more boring. Such a great tour,  Emma was amazing as was Dan a the bus driver.  Taking a picture of my daughter in front of the bus and Emma photo bombed it.  Talk about go above and beyond.  Loved it go if you get chance you won t be disappointed We had great frightening fun! The actress and the actor have been fabulous   the locations too, thanks for the tour! Just amazing experience, actors on bus Dan and Ashling were so good these guys should be on broadway  also a big shout out to bus Driver Sean  who was very friendly and informative Highly recommend you go on this tour Visited on The actors were nice and enthusiastic.  The problem was the manager/driver.  He was full of excuses for the few problems that occurred on the tour.  This included a patron that had a party of 3 and the seats were changed.  This family had asked to get their same seats and the crowd was not helping.  All were easy to resolve and have the talent laugh it off and make all happy.  But the driver, who was clearly in charge, made unnecessary excuses blaming this, that and the other.  This family had left the tour and made things feel a little sad.  Further, it made no difference to the manager.  Disappointing. Absolutely amazing tour group! The bus was decked out like a haunted house on wheels! They had some great guides in spooky make-up and costumes take us around the city and give us a terrifying and educational tour about some of the scariest bits of the history of Dublin, Ireland. No spoilers, but we had a phenomenal time! 10/10 would go again! What a fun night!! Everyone does such a wonderful job. You are so into the stories and the good scary fun you forget your on a bus.  Must go!!! This is a really great, historical tour of Dublin! The actors are amazing and so dedicated to their work- and the bus driver is the coolest guy! We highly recommend this tour!:) plus the shots at the end of the tour are definitely a bonus Huge disappointment mainly due to lack of safety awareness. We were ca. 50 people on a single bus floor with nearly no ventilation and absolutely no air conditioning (during covid pandemic). It was super humid and very hard to breathe with people coughing all around us. What is even worse is that the main actor told us a story over a burning candle while the bus was in motion. I am wondering how no one in this company thought of the aftermaths in case the candle dropped over someone sitting nearby. We would have easily become the story for their next tour. The performance ended right in front of the graveyard, no idea why we even drove there. The plot is all about the plague - the stories are  rather disgusting than spooky. The language is not really suitable for kids. The actors did invest efforts but I think it did not work out so well - it was hard to hear them, sometimes they were way too far, sometimes way too close in our personal spaces. The bus looked cool but the lack of ventilation and super tiny seats spoiled the experience. Thumbs up for the idea but please review your safety rules, as well as your flyers. We paid 29 euros instead of the printed 25 euros, and did not get the free walking haunted tour. Very good experience within the Bus Tour! 2-hour walk with 3 stops and a  phantom guide  to tell us terrifying stories! Refreshment bar offering a beer at the end of the circuit and non-alcoholic drinks for those who do not consume them. Very friendly driver I highly recommend ! Was on last nights tour, and it was brilliant. Highly recommend! Sean was the best driver, actors and tour was brilliant. Highly recommend! Absolutely brilliant! Such good value for money! This tour has everything, horror, comedy and really interesting history! The girls were amazing! They had everyones attention the whole time, had us hiding behind our coats and had us in stitches! Thank you! Found the tour a bit boring. The guide wasnt great tbh and used a lot of unnecessary bad language. it was difficult to hear him at times too and he could have done with a microphone ..I would be reluctant to recommend this tour DO NOT BOOK THIS TOUR!!! I purchased a ticket on the Gravedigger Bus Tour while on vacation to Dublin. I showed up 15mins early as prompted, but the bus arrived late. As the bus finally started boarding passengers, I was not allowed to board even though I had purchased a ticket. I was then informed that the bus was sold out to a private party and my ticket was not valid. I was then told to stand to the side as the bus driver flagged over a woman who told me repeatedly that she could not help me or offer a refund. She claimed that she wasn t supposed to be working that night and she had somewhere more important that she needed to be before rushing off into another vehicle. I was stuck standing in the cold for almost an hour and humiliated in front of other tourists, then shooed off because no one wanted to deal with me. I have never felt more embarrassed or publicly humiliated in my life, and after reading other other low rated reviews on this site, I m glad I was prevented from experiencing this tour. very good experience.  actor did all he could to make the trip engaging for all. even stopped for a pint at the gravediggers pub This was done well and the actors were good. But it was not what we expected. It s just a bunch of storytelling and getting on and off a bus -not actually visiting or exploring any of the locations. We were disappointed And the bus was very hot and packed and no air circulation. What a great tour. The guides were so incredible fun and entertaining. This was my favorite tour in Dublin. If you have the time, I highly recommend taking a trip on the Grave Digger Bus! My mum and I did this on our first night in Dublin. We were tired from traveling all through the night from Atlanta. WE. HAD. SO. MUCH. FUN. I squealed. My mum fell out in the aisle at one point--in a good way. (Our talented guide said that was a first.) Everyone we encountered on the team was fun and engaging. We learned a lot. And, we felt a part of the whole event. Your knowledge of Prince lyrics might come in handy. Yes, it was that good. Im a local and I booked this tour for a few people who were one night in Dublin. When they got to the pickup point they said it was cancelled - there no effort made to check resellers sites and no effort made to stop selling it on the actual site either. Tourists time can be precious and I would not recommend to book this as they are happy to let people down Probably the worst tour I have ever been on. Actor was constantly repeating himself and had to be prompted lines. No storyline to it. It was hard to listen to. People left and didn t get back on the bus half way through as they were fed up. Couldn t recommend less. This tour has very mixed reviews and Im afraid I have to agree with the lower ratings. But to start with the positive, the tour  would probably appeal to your teenagers and anyone with a juvenile sense of humour. And the actors do try. But the whole concept is very tired and badly executed. The formula was put in place a long time ago and theres been no attempt to improve or refresh it - quite literally in the case of the bus which is filthy and the clothes used by actors which smell rank. The history part is of no use really as its so garbled and fragmented. I felt sorry for the non-native speakers in the group as they could hardly understand a word, the delivery was that rapid, colloquial  and audibility poor. Overall, the tour is a licence to print  money for the operator and I got a strong sense that they cant be bothered to change it in any way. Id recommend going on a proper tour of one of the places where they stop instead (Dublin castle, Kilmainham, Glasnevin cemetery - at least the latter two have excellent interpretive centres/guided tours). 17 September, 2018 Humiliating This tour was entertaining enough, but the end of my evening was spoiled when our tour guide spit on me and I had to sit through  the rest of the tour with spit and  plague water  running down my chest and into my bra. It s the first time anyone has looked me in the eye and decide that it was acceptable to spit on me. It got on my clothes, bag, and face. And he only did it for a cheap laugh. I refused to sip the water at the beginning of the tour because I think sharing drinks is kinda gross and I ended my tour covered in spit. While the rest of the tour was great I cannot not recommend something so vile. This was a thouroughly excellent, enjoyable tour. Just great fun !! Brillaint tour guides and interesting history delivered in an exciting way!! I read a review which said it was hard to locate ! Thats nonsense .. just head to Trinity college which you cant miss unless you are walking around with your eyes shut !! Definately not a scam and worth asking any local or taxi driver for help. Im reviewing this on my daughters account. Tina Simpson Very poor ... not what I expected, not scary doesnt last the 2 hours..not worth the money ...the girls are great at story telling/ Acting ..but still found it abit boring. This was a great haunted tour but not what I expected as it leans way more toward comedy than horror. The guides are very good and make it worth going on provided you have a sense of humor, just know that if its pure horror and scary material/ ghost stories your after this may not be for you. Absolutley great tour. Very funny and some jump scares too. Andrew and Dan were excellent guides. Couldnt have asked for better. Very cool! Laura and Caleb are amazing actors and the stories were very spooky! It was a scary and funny experience! Was a bit confused by this experience given the other reviews - there was very little content of the tour and the acting was hard to follow. Basically just a bus trip (you can t see out the windows) with some weird acting- but maybe today was just a bad day!? Also they drop you off at this local pub outside of Dublin for 15 mins at the end - it s cash only and we did not feel welcome there. Maybe look elsewhere for evening entertainment! Just an expensive uncomfortable bus ride.. The attractions can just be seen from outside, the guide talks so fast and unclear that it wasnt really possible to understand him (my English is on a c1 level) and I didnt get the promised drink, even though I told it the guide. Im angry about the wasted time and money and wont recommend it. Not just ghost stories but a phenomenal and hysterical retelling of a haunted Irish history with one of the most talented young men dublin has to offer. Eamon truly excels at his craft and made this tour the highlight of our visit to Irelands fair city. How could you go wrong with a tour that stops for a PINT! Fun story telling, learning walking and hop on hop off tour. Adults are best. Love the characters we met! Our last night in Ireland, we went on this tour. Laughed so much and thoroughly enjoyed the show!  It was so much fun! Sorry this was such a disappointment.  Basically getting on and off the bus listening to stories, nothing scary about it. Bummer. Would give it zero stars if possible.  Made the reservation and told where it was.  We could not find it-not even GPS could help locate it.  We even called the number for help but no one answered the phone.  We walked around for about 45 minutes trying to find the location of the tour but finally gave up.  Could this be a scam? It was absolutely amazing, we had so much fun laughing at the guide who was brilliant! would highly reccommend! Uncomfortable blacked out bus ride with only two of the advertised five stops. Also some pretty atrocious fire safety issues My friends and I decided to do the tour over the weekend. Honestly I didnt have a clue what the guide was on about half the time but he was hilarious. It was comical. My friends did say probably would have been funnier if we had a couple of drinks before hand. That special guest proclaimer Ross was a hoot, he should be brought on every tour! An excellent tour. Full of fun, facts and frightening moments. I can highly recommend it."
182,The Irish Rock 'n' Roll Museum Experience,4.975,"We hadnt been to the museum before despite being regular visitors to Dublin. We loved it. It is a fascinating and eclectic experience, which includes not only the more usual rock and roll memorabilia, but also included interesting oddities such as Michael Jacksons pyjama top and Phil Lynotts school report card. All brought together by the passion and gentle storytelling of our fabulous tour guide, Alan. Would definitely visit again, thank you so much. What a lovely experience! Our tour guide was Bryan and he was amazing. Very friendly, full of interesting facts and willing to answer any questions. If you want you can grab a beer in their bar and bring it along with you. Youll see a lot of amazing instruments and musical equipment, and also watch a short film about Irish music history. You will learn a lot from Bryan so dont miss it when youre in Dublin! Visit if you want to learn a lot about Irish Rock N Roll culture, listen to music and become a real fan of Irish music One of the best museum I visited in Dublin, thanks to our great Tour Guide Alan! He is the best and introduced us to the Irish Rock  N  Roll culture! He is an extremely knowledgeable person with great sense of humor! The Museum itself has a lot to offer from the younger beginners to the well-familiar Rock N Roll fans!     I definitely recommend to visit that Museum once you are in Dublin! Enjoyed the visit. Great selection of Irish rock memories. Being a Thin Lizzy fan I was delighted to see the collection in the recording room. Highly recommended Amazing experience at this one of a kind museum, definitely a not to be missed Dublin attraction! The tour was absolutely captivating, funny and informative and we heard a lot of interesting stories from the best guide ever, Alan! Thank you sir! Even got a mini live performance from one of his colleagues, how about that? If you love music, you definitely must check this museum out, youll have a great time here! Tip: the entrance in the museum is through the bar. Our tour guide was Emily, she was amazing, funny and just such a lovely person. You learn so much about Irish musicians and also get to interact with instruments as well! Amazing.  Huge U2 fan so this was a must stop. I was blown away then I first walked into the U2 room. Was really informative on many other artists as well. So much interesting information and memorabilia in the museum. We loved hearing the stories behind all the great music.  Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable. It s an excellent experience! Guided tour in French by Ariane, really great, (she s the one who asked us to say it but for now it s the truth  ) Anecdotes about groups or singers known from the Irish rock scene. The atmosphere of the studio visit for rock fans is something. If you are a music fan, dont hesitate to go for it. Wonderful! The tour was great with loads of history. I grew up listening to a lot of music from the UK & Ireland, so this was a must. If you are into music then this is a must visit place. The guide was excellent and gave some brilliant insight into the history of the place. Well recommended. A must for all rock fans! This museum is really unusual because it has recording studios, corridors filled with photos and vinyls... I wont say more but we loved this experience! It was worth the visit. We got to see memorabilia from rock n roll stars and saw a short film about rock. They talked about the history of rock music and how Ireland played a role in shaping it. This place is a must see for music enthusiasts. Myself and my partner really enjoyed the experience. I didnt want to add any pictures as I think they should be enjoyed in person. Its a must for any fan of music. Ireland produced some amazing talent in the last 5 decades and its all encompassed in this tour. Our tour guide was Alan. He was excellent. Funny entertaining knowledgeable and had some really great stories and anecdotes. Id love a private tour from him just to hear more of his stories The only problem? It went too quickly!!! Myself and my partner loved every minute of it. Would definitely go back again. Worth every penny. Plus 1h30 visit in French in this museum (which is not just a museum: bar, performance hall, recording studio, etc.) Special mention to Arianne the Breton! She was super attentive Absolutely brilliant tour & great guide, Scott. Thank you. So knowledgeable & loads to enjoy and look at. A must for any music fan. Thanks. A tour that was one of the best we have ever done. History, good vibes, music, sharing and caring.. Thanks Alan, we will continue to share the beautiful values of music and rock! (We made the tour in English and we fully understood it!) PS : I ll come back to show you my progress in drums! Alan made this tour an absolute highlight of our visit to Dublin. His knowledge of the museum, studio and artists who have passed through it over the last 30 years was not just extensive, but revealed a very personal and emotional connection which at times tugged at the heartstrings. His personal favourite was Rory Gallagher who he met in the 90s just before he sadly passed away (far too soon) and he was a little crestfallen to learn that I myself had seen him perform live in the early seventies (I have attached a copy of my ticket below as a constant reminder to him  ). We had to persuade our friends to go to the museum, as it was the day of our departure, but Im so glad we did. Thank you to Alan and all the staff for a fantastic morning. 5 Stars seems something of an underrating of this experience which was (and I never use this word because its never appropriate - until now) AWESOME!!! If you only got the slightest interest in rock music you should consider a visit. Our tour passionate guide Alan made it even more worth visiting this place. If you are a fan of rock and passing through Dublin, you absolutely have to go there! Must-see attraction for the music fan, and certainly an interesting experience for all.  Scott proved to be a fantastic and entertaining guide.  This is an up-close and personal look at the history and development of Irish music and artists as supported by the Temple Lane studio since the early 1970s.  Definitely worth a look.  Highly recommended. Scott was such a great tour guide and the whole experience was so much fun! I would definitely recommend getting tickets or seeing tour times in advance because you can only see the museum on a tour. There is a bar, record shop, and music venue with so much history that share the building. such a great spot! Very nice experience with a very pleasant group and thanks to Camille for all these explanations, her sympathy and her smile Got a chance to visit this absolutely beautiful place filled with rich Irish Music history. Our tour guide Alan was very funny and filled with knowledge. He shared a lot of interesting details about the place and the music history. We got to be a part of live performance in one of the recording studios. This visit was definitely worth it. This tour was great! Scott, our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly.  He has passion for music and it shows. I learned more about Irish music history and had a great time. An amazing place for all music lovers. So many cult places and objects. Plus, you get to learn so many great facts about Irish rock! The guides are also super amazing and interesting. It s clear that they talk to you about music from a place of love. 10/10 would go again! Highly recommended!  This far surpassed our expectations and was really fun.  Alan was outstanding guide.  Skip the bookless library and rock out instead I really enjoyed this tour. The guide was great and the musical history was overwhelming, so much great music from the Irish over the years! Thin Lizzy, cranberries, U2 and so many more...This place is an absolute stop for the musical history enthusiast. We had an impromptu stop at the Rock n Roll museum in order mainly to get out of the Irish summer rain. We were very pleasantly surprised. Our tour guide was really enthusiastic and gave us lots of insights into this venue, the artists who have performed and recorded there and also gave instrument players on the tour, the opportunity to rock out in the same room as some of their heroes. Highly recommended! Our favorite thing we ve done in Dublin so far! We had Alan as our guide and what a compelling, funny, and warm human. We got to learn about the history of Irish music but also discover the emotional ties of Irish music to the people of this great country. So many incredible musicians have also recorded in this building, it s like walking in the same rooms as your favorite bands/acts and knowing historic art was created there and STILL IS. Artists actively record and rehearse in their facilities/booths etc. anyway, it was fabulous to see, and we were blown away by the warmth and passion behind the company. Recommend to anyone who appreciates music (so everyone). So, this was really worth every cent I have paid for the entry. It was funny, enjoyable, but also very informative!   Big thumbs up Well what can I say but this was exceptional. Allan our guide was so knowledgeable and so passionate it was an experience in itself. The depth of Irish music was amazing. We nearly didnt go but saw a review of Allan and decided to go we are so happy we did. Fantastic! If you love rock at all, it s a must do stop! They have so many amazing things to see and the tour guides and people working there love their job. Shout out to Glenn, very passionate and loves what he s doing. (P.S. Glenn, if you re reading this and interested in more Ghost, I Recommend Cirice, Ritual, Rats, Dance Macabre, and From The Pinnacle To The Pit) A must-see in Dublin if youre a rock fan. The hard tour +/- 1h15, we learn lots of things about Irish rock groups and it s very interactive! Our guide (Anais) was very nice, we will keep very good memories of it :) The guided tour absolutely exceeded my expectations. Alan is the best tour guide Ive ever met. I even got to play the drums with one of the artists at the studio  making me feel like a rock star performing for a wee crowd. Fantastic! Was a bit sceptical at first but our (amazing) host Bryan soon charmed us with all the stories of the artists who came through these rooms. The entire tour lasted a bit less than two hours but time flew by so fast. We got to see Michael Jacksons pajamas, sit on Bonos sofa and my kid got to play the drums. Sounds weird now that Im writing this. Anyway. So much musical history in this place! Would definitely come again. Amazing tour, such interesting information about their bands and current musicians who use the space. Such fun and interactive rooms and time to play the instruments and play dress up in some costumes. Our tour guide Brian was so helpful and had so many funny stories to tell us including the artists displayed. Would definitely recommend to a music lover. Very pleasant experience, especially for something called a museum. But instead of seeing a boring exposition, this tour is about hearing all the interesting stories that are presented by a tour guide. You will hear about the history and what formed the Irish music culture, the biggest starts, and the current bands. I strongly recommend. It will tell you about Irish culture more than any monument sightseeing of the city. This venue is a highlight of our trip Dublin. It exceeded all expectations.  Thank you to Scott our tour guide. If you find yourself in Dublin and you love music make sure sure you visit The Irish Rock n Roll Museum! It was worth the trip from Tasmania Visited on Amazing museum, lovely tour by our exceptional tour guide Scott. Recommend it any day of the week  Also, you never know, you might bump into a rock legend. Scott is extremely professional, it was a pleasure to be guided by him, and they also played a song together with my boyriend    we had a really nice time."
183,The Jeanie Johnston: An Irish Famine Story,4.925,"I visited Jeanie Johnston famine ship with a group of my students and we simply loved the tour. Our tour guide Owen was very skilled, such a great storyteller! The tour was fun and engaging. My kids truly enjoyed this experience and so did I. Highly recommend! This ship called the Jeanie Johnston - mind you this is a replica as the original sank -  tells the story of the Irish famine and the people who fled Ireland to embark on a gruelling voyage in the hope of a better life in the US. Its a very well put-together 50 min program with knowledgeable guides who take you through the ships history including real life stories of passengers. The Jeanie Johnston was actually called the miracle ship as it suffered no casualties because of its compassionate owner, its equally compassionate captain and a doctor on board (apparently the only ship with a doctor on board). I The Jeanie Johnston was a brilliant place to visit. You are guided (you must take a guided tour) around a replica of a ship which took Irish emigrants fleeing the Great Hunger to North America, learning about the famines history and the stories of the ship, crew and passengers. Our knowledgable guide Steve handled the subject with tact, intelligence and a much-needed sprinkling of Irish humour. Superb. Im a Dublin native. My family and clan lived in Ireland going all the way back to the 15th century. Yesterday I brought my Italian partner to the Jeanie with the hope it would be educational and add some weight, emotion, relatability and gravity to the Great Irish Famine. Noels tour certainly delivered. I felt his tour fleshed out and humanised the victims of the genocide that was the Great Famine. A genocide that is globally treated in a light-hearted, joking fashion, largely due to the depictions of the Irish in things like the Simpsons. Noel, tactfully and rightly did not use the G word, as it may put off those uninitiated to the subject. Regardless, his tour made a lasting impression on my partner and was a great introduction into Irish history. As a tall ship enthusiast, it was also an absolute pleasure to be aboard. I will be recommending a tour aboard the Jeanie to family, friends and colleagues visiting Dublin Visited during a freezing rainy gale.. It was a great chance to see what it would be like on deck at sea in a storm..  albeit we were in 21st Century kit! The Jeanie Johnston is Fantastic It is such a fantastic story and our guide was brilliant. The boat is amazing especially below deck, you really get a sense of what it was like. The end of the story is truly awe inspiring BUT you will have to visit for yourself to find out what happened. The ticket gives access to Epic The museum which is truly EPIC a real view of Irish history but in a modern digital immersive set of displays. This was deinately a highlight of our trip to Dublin and we certainly recommend it goes on your itinerary I am so happy I was able to squeeze in the tour of the Jeanie Johnston unexpectedly on my last day in Dublin.  Shocking, touching, deeply moving facts and personal stories. The visual renderings of life on the ship was actually shocking. I was literally moved to tears during this tour. Our guide was incredible, so knowledgeable, personable. A remarkable and important piece of Irelands history, and for a woman of the Irish diaspora, keenly informative and evocative. It was amazing, if you love history you cannot miss this place, never seen a guide as passionate as him, Garoge was amazing and wish to have stayed my wife and I to talk more for he have so much knowledge and made a complex history look accessible to all. I strongly recommend dont miss it you would regret it. Visited the Jeannie Johnston in Dublin and it was amazing. Its a replica of a 19th-century ship that brought emigrants to North America. Great for understanding Irelands history. You have to do the tour to learn how this ship managed to have 0 deaths. Highly recommend! The story of Jeanie Johnston is miracle. Thanks for the humanitarian captain, doctor, and ship owner, no one died on the ship during the many voyages carrying Irish people to north America in the Great Famine time. I purchased the bundled ticket with EPIC museum together. The 50 min tour is definitely out of my expectation. The tour takes approximately 50 minutes and is led by one of our knowledgeable guides. The tour begins with a walk around the upper deck, where you will see the majestic masts, admire the craftsmanship and learn about the ship s history. Step on board and you will be transported back in time to join them on their gruelling journey. Our guide was brilliant, his stories were very interesting and cognitively even for younger audiences. Highlights of the Tour: Learn how the Famine forced millions to flee the country Retrace their gruelling journey Experience what life was like on board Uncover fascinating personal passenger stories Award-winning tour guides Meticulous craftsmanship Marvel at the beautiful tall ship Nearby is the poignant Famine Memorial by Dublin sculptor Rowan Gillespie. I really like how the tourist guide provides the information and tells the history of this ship. The tourist guide is very knowledgeable, and she always made sure that everyone heard what she was explaining. The ship itself is very amazing, and Im glad that I visit this ship as part of my sightseeing. This was one of the best and most interesting tours we went on in Dublin. Our tour guide was incredible - fascinating, engaging, personable, and so friendly. And so knowledgeable!! I was impressed that there were things she had dug into herself to find out because she was just curious about them. She clearly had a passion for history and it was incredible to learn from her. Highly highly recommend!! (Oh and I think her name was Claire!) The story of the Jeanie Johnston is a poignant one - especially with regard to the circumstances of the famine in Ireland, and the players involved: the shipowner, the captain and the doctor who was the hero and lives-saver of the passengers who rushed their lives for their families they leave behind in Ireland while they seek the money to send back to their families. And there was the passenger who gave birth on the ship, whose descendants gratefully came to Ireland to give thanks some 160 years later. All these story was succinctly narrated by Steve who showed us around and explained the circumstances and times and the experiences of the people who sailed in the Jeannie Johnston. A tour strongly recommended to know what the Irish had gone through and fought to survive. Klarie was the most amazing tour guide, she brought the story alive. If you want to know more and see more about one of the most significant events in Irish history I highly recommend going here. Not only will you get to see an amazing ship but you will get some great insights into this historical event. Our guide was Klarie who was funny, witty and very knowledgeable. I could not recommend this tour higher! Its 45 min of your life you will not regret. Unmissable visit in Dublin The visit was really very interesting and we learned a lot. Our guide spoke very clearly (in English) and we had no difficulty understanding him Thanks to the team Absolutely a delight experience. The powerful way and enthusiastic from our tour guide puts in every part of this shop story is incredible. She is unique!  I was mesmerised with every part and bittersweet memories from our ancestors leaving their beautiful, and maybe forever, land is quite strong. Such a wonderful time and beautiful weather. Thanks for this amazing time Beautiful ship museum in the center of Dublin.  There is a fee to visit the ship, and I advise you to buy tickets in advance, because we were not able to get there. When we had a tour of the city and we stopped near this ship, and the guide told us its story. A must see tour of Dublin. Our incredible guide Claire took us onboard and told us stories of what it was like onboard. A brilliant tour and tour guide. Fascinating history, some very sad stories and some heartwarming stories. Clare was our guide. She has a talent for telling a story and I could have listened to her all day. Tour only takes about an hour but well worth it. Visited on This was a great experience in of Dublins less known attractions. It tells the story of the many people that left their country to find a better future in the US. the guide is a lovely girl, very knowledgeable and kind. It is definitely worth your time. I liked the boat and that we could wander around it at leisure! Guide was quite informative, but slightly wooden and obviously had rehearsed his script. He was willing to answer questions and this was when he was better. Fascinating story of how badly the Irish were treated and how this ship helped some of them. We had Claire - it was a great tour & Claire was a great host. We had a fantastic tour & it was very emotive and informative. Thank you Very interesting and well worth visiting. Our guide was knowledgeable and passionate, bringing history to life through the personal stories of those who had sailed in the Jeanie Johnston to escape the famine in Ireland. We learnt a lot. Not to be missed. Incredible tour. The lady who was in charge of ours was very knowledgeable she knew lots of detail. Its interesting how one of the only babies born on board had 19 first names!! Learnt about simple things that helped so many survive compared to other ships. Its wonderful to learn the incredible stories behind this ship, including the famine that plagued Ireland.  A living history lesson. We were very lucky to get tour guide Claire. Wow, this lady brought so much history to life. Emotional at times and very factual , honest and thought provoking. Was not expecting it to be as good. Well done to everyone involved. The Jeanie Johnston is an iconic and imposing boat. It is steeped in history that the guide shares with us throughout the visit. It transports us into the past recounting the difficult journeys aboard it, to new lands. An enriching visit that helps us understand the travelers journey to escape famine. In short, a very nice visit. A really interesting and informative experience. Steve was a great tour guide who told a fascinating recount of the Irish famine. It s definitely worth an hour of your time in Dublin. Lovely experience! The guide was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. Such a fun experience, even our young children enjoyed it! We decided to do a tour here while visiting Ireland and it was a great experience we learned a lot and had fun checking out the replica ship. Our guide Gearoid was knowledgeable and funny! Interesting and highly informative visit to a replica of the famous ship taking Irish migrants to the American contintent during the Great Famine - the guide gave a lot of historical details concerning not only the ship but also the whole context of those times. And last but not least, it was fun as well. Some reviews here complain about guides being only in English. Well, even our kids understood most of what our guide told us. No problem at all. The best visit we had in Dublin on our recent stay. It was really fascinating and a moving and informative visit full of great information. Our guide Claire did a superb job and I could not recommend her highly enough. A real must if you are interested in the history of Ireland and the Potato famine in particular. Great tour, Lu was an amazing guide. We were lucky that we were in a small group of 6 people, Sunday at 11:00. The next tour at 12:00 had about 35 people. Very interesting experience. We learned loads and had an amazing guide! We visited Jeanie Johnston with Noel as our guide. Noel is extremely professional, knowledgeable and on top of that an excellent story teller. We can highly recommend this tour for many reasons Great experience. Ship was very nice and the tour amazing. Great guide (Gerald) who delivered the impressive story of this ship and its time in an informative but relaxing way. Great insights in the famine, its consequences and life on this ship. Best thing we visited in Dublin! Visited the Jeanie Johnson on Sunday, our tour guide was Garrold (sorry if that s wrong). Fantastic guide, very professional and informative.Great people skill and engaging with all age ranges of the group.  Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin to make this part of their visit. Great place to visit. All tours are guided Excellent tour - Clare was our guide. Very moving stories. Well organised. Visited on A wonderful, insightful experience delving into a time in history very few non Irish people are aware of. Katrina, our guide, was one of the best guides we ve ever had her relatability, sense of humor, sincerity, and insight show  just how much she wanted us to appreciate, respect, and learn from the past. She was the best!"
184,The Joker's Chair,4.666666666666667,"Best city in the city centre public park.  Dont need tickets for the public ok   lovely in the summer. Really good, I get like I was the Joker from the Batman Beautiful memorial, and the park is so peaceful <3 An interesting Joker Chair in the center of the garden, you can sit on it nan nan nan nan nan"
185,The Morning,4.325,"Good coffee, very well made. The food was on the pricy end, but it was really good. The person that took our order seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else at the moment. It was close to closing, but that still gave us a bad vibe. The most spectacular bakery. You can really taste that everything is made fresh and with skill and love. Most delicious! Definitely recommend. Super cosy to sit and have a coffee and a pastry Best cookie Ive had in Dublin. Most cookies out there have milk chocolate but this ones combination of dark choc and salt was top notch. Perfect texture too, crunchy on the outside and gluey inside. Totally recommend the look of the other treats and foccaccias they had too. Coffee was good but nothing special, though. Nice quiet atmosphere in a calm Street just outside the city centre. The bakery is right next door. Theres a some tables inside and a few outside. The staff is nice. Amazing place with great coffee ( I judge by the Cappuccino which was not too hot, perfect milk foam and taste) and delicious sourdough buns You can dine in or take out (focaccia available for take out). Super nice stuff. Definitely recommend for a coffe stop or breakfast/ brunch Recommended dishes Sourdough Cinnamon Bun, Coffee and Buns, Sourdough Morning Bun This place is sooooo yummy. The morning bun, mortadella pastry and salt and vinegar potato foccacia are all exceptional! We came back twice on our short stay in Dublin. Coffee is also very good, iced flat white for the win. Cute little take away cafe with no seating area. The chocolate hazelnut sourdough thing for 3.50  was tasty, so was the cinnamon bun. 4.50  for the size of the chai latte is a little overpriced IMO. Still a good place to get a snack when you re in the area. There was a rock in my cookie. Cookie was still good but I wish it was without rock. Always wanted to visit this cafe, and everything turned out to be perfect. Oat flatwhite tasted really good and smooth. The buns were soft and tasty! The highlight of the experience was definitely the food. The dish was well crafted, with an interesting and surprisingly harmonious combination of veggies, bacon and french toast. My simplified description might be doing it a disservice but to expand on  veggies : every leafy bit, crushed tomato and charred pepper was so delightful. In contrast, service and atmosphere was just alright, nothing mind-blowing there. Coffee is also really good. Recommend to get it to-go from next door to savour it post meal. Terrible food. Very stale sandwich for 9 , as it was left on the countertop all day. Hot chocolate and coffee also very bland and overpriced. DO NOT COME HERE Lovely independent coffee house. Great for brunch / lunch. Delicious greens and tasty food. Also a small outside area if its sunny (good luck!). However there is no Wifi. Coffee could be a little better compared to other places in Dublin. But the lunch menu is amazing and the service is really friendly. We recommend it. Cutest coffee shop with good pasties and coffee. They have lots of good savory and sweet pastries and potato pastry was sooo good. Great food. Great coffee. Great staff. The Eggs and Greens dish was beautiful and it was super fresh and well presented. Had a cake treat for pudding...a good place to indulge! Tip the staff - they re awesome! Don t spin that payment terminal around hustling for a tip on my espresso. This trend needs to stop. A study from the UK found decal matter on 100% of tested screens. Don t force me to touch it when I click  no tip . Excellent fresh brunch and coffee. The focus of the dishes was more on the quality of the food and much less on overwhelming you with flavors and salt. Very refreshing. Not convinced... the foccacia made me really want it but it was dry (maybe because I was given the end), it clearly lacked fat, the charred broccoli didnt add anything... there was a vague taste of honey .I have tasted lots of much better focaccia and not at  4.50 a slice. This was the best oat latte I had in Dublin. The bakery selection is also very nice. Friendly staff Food Good. Coffee was very good, staff friendly and nice atmosphere but wasnt the biggest fan of my main course. Some of the items didnt suit the dish. Also if you pay more then 3 EUR for a coffee they should bring you sweeteners and sugar . Okay at best - Maybe overhyped it with all the word of mouth going on about this place, but once I was here, I was not wowed at all. Dishes try to be authentic and different, but they feel a bit forced (random ingredients that would normally not be mixed together). We tried a different plate each to see and try multiple dishes, and none of them was fantastic. Also, a bit on the overpriced side, not too much but you do feel it in your wallet. We asked for some modifications on our order (removing and/or adding ingredients) and in the end some of the plates were not how we wanted them. In the end, we had a coffee and some of the donuts, which were a actually quite good (no picture of them, we finished them too quickly!) Not a bad place by any means, but dont expect to have your mind blown like many people say you will. Came upon this place by chance. A real gem for breakfast or brunch . Great coffee- intriguing  options-  pickled beets - whipped ricotta- but all seem to work. Great bread.Soon expanding i with a wine bar next door. Top recommendation. A very nice sandwich filled with aubergine, peppers and courgette - the bread was simply delicious, crunchy and light. And the coffee: oh my, by far one the best I ever had in Dublin. Great coffee and the baked goods were exceptional, honestly everything was amazing both savory and sweet, cant wait to go back Wow, came  to this cosy gem of a cafe for the first time today. The menu here is so inspiring. A very colourful, creative and unique brunch menu. We have been in Dublin for 8 months, frequent a cafe brunch and this is the best weve found. We highly recommend eating here!  Food 5/5. Coffee 4/5. Babycinnos are available too. Pictured is the Arancini and black pudding special. Yes, very Intragrammable place Yes, very yummy pastries and coffee Food Had an amazing brunch at Meet Me in the Morning on a Sunday. The coffee is such a high quality, they have a takeaway coffee place next door. The food was delicious, had a poached egg veg hash, very filling. The staff are very friendly, we think there was a mess up with our order so took a while, the owner realised this, apologized and offered us a free coffee which is excellent customer service. We bought some coffee, the owner (despite obviously being busy) took his time to tell us about it, how we should make it and ground it for us - brilliant customer service! Would definitely go back, you should too! Great bread and coffee. Sunny Sunday mornings requires a nice walk and a coffee.   I and my partner came across this little place, just off South Richmond street when walking out dog. Highly recommend trying their bread as well, specially the parmesan and basil one. the morning bakery is so lovely! the focaccia, pastries n sandwiches are delicious! the coffee is really lovely too but to be honest it s ridiculously small, so i would personally skip on it, but definitely will b back for the food!!! Excellent breakfast. The eggs and greens was very unique - poached eggs topped with yogurt and paprika aioli. Super cute cafe in Portobello. Their food is delicious, the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY, the location is perfect and interiors are so cozy and nice. Highly recommend to try: EGGS + GREENS , MUSHIES TORTILLA , ROASTED SPROUTS and Spicy Chai Latte Definitely worth to check this cafe out!! 5 stars!!!! The best brunch place Ive tried so far in Dublin. We had to wait around 30 minutes on a Saturday morning, but it was totally worth it. The quality of the ingredients is amazing and everything was very tasty. I particularly liked the fact the menu was short, which I think allows a restaurant to become really good in the specific plates they offer while, at the same time, making easier the choice of the customer. Highly recommended!! Nice food but a tad pricey. Came here after reading some great reviews but I m not completely sold. The decor and atmosphere is nice and the food was okay. I felt the menu was a little limited as there wasn t loads of choices. I would maybe go again if I was in the immediate area but I wouldn t go out of my way. The atmosphere of the cafe on a Sunday morning was very friendly and cozy! The food was pretty esthetic (very instagramable). Regarding the taste, I was a bit disappointed. The dessert was way too sweet though. I would still recommend it! Great coffee and great food. Probably the best brunch place in Dublin. Brunch here is very nice, theres second floor, big enough for a big group. Staffs are super friendly! Absolute gem in terms of coffee and in terms of breakfast. Creative dishes, deliciously fresh veg. Friendly staff. Very popular, come early or be prepared to wait. Bright and minimal decor, MMIM has an easy attitude to good food in a neighborhood area off the busy streets of on South city. I chose the McNally Mash from the menu. Its a satisifying, wholesome dish with Potatoes and poached egg with beet sour cream, greens and halloumi.  Friendly and efficient staff. The menu is always innovative and healthy, the staff are welcoming and familiar, and the location has the feeling of a hidden gem. These guys have raised the bar for brunch. Very good plaice, the food is simple, good combinations and attention in the choice of ingredients. Absolutely lovely coffee with oatmilk. Cappucino, latte & flat white were all served from same size cups and looked very much alike, but all were delicious nevertheless. :) Mushrooms with poached eggs were very tasty too. First stop when arriving in Dublin, cute spot, had an espresso and a croissant ! Recommend"
186,The Music Cafe Dublin,4.1,"Small cafe located on the banks of the Liffey. Its very small, it doesnt look much from the outside but its worth it. The pastries are all super good. There are several varieties of teas. The server is super nice. Well the price is like everywhere in Dublin, quite high. Kid-friendliness: Suitable for little ones but very limited space for strollers If you look for a classical place, this place is proper. Their menus are enough. They serve your orders quick. View is good to watch the city center ambiance while you drink your smoothie ;) Had a lovely toastie and tea on my way to work and it set me up for the day. This is a lovely little place with a lovely relaxed atmosphere.  And thank you to the waitress that ran after me to give me my headphones. Very cute cafe. The coffee is delicious and definitely worth the price. They got yummy snacks both sweet and salty. Definitely would come here again, highly recommended :) Food Charming little cafe, old school jazz cafe vibes. We got poached eggs on toast, a ham and cheese toastie they were okay, very affordable. We drank an iced latte and chai latte which I enjoyed the chai latte. Might return for the quaint jazzy, sunny afternoon by the river atmosphere Was really looking forward to a visit here. Cool interior,nice atmosphere. The service on the other hand made this visit a disappointment. No hello,no welcome,no explaining how one orders. No idea that the lunch menu was finished. No problem. Carrot cake was fine. I felt I was intruding. They came to the table at 3:30pm to say they were closing in 10mins. I sat down at 3:05pm. They close at 4pm on this occasion. Will have a peek in the spacious windows to see if its the same staff next time I walk by. But I wont be recommending here until then. Shame really. I found this place while in Dublin on a shopping trip before christmas 2022. At first, I said this place is my type of place to sit and have a coffee, it had real character, nice building, lovely design inside very cosy little place to hang out right beside the quays on the Liffey. I went in and there was a sign saying card payment only, I immediately said that is a bummer as I only have cash. We had a little chat about how I felt about this and the guy took my order which was very nice of him, I ordered a lovely slice of peanut and toffee cake and a coffee and off to take my seat down the back in a nice cosy space, looking out at passers by, the coffee and cake was brought to my table, and the cake was absolutely delicious and I sat there for awhile, I did mention to the server that the cake was lovely, I asked was it homemade, he said nope it was frozen. Either way, I snapped a few pictures of the interior and was happy on my way. Great location, great cake even if not homemade, and I think, I paid approx  6.50 for coffee and cake in all. I felt like I was intruding by walking in and asking for a coffee and a bap. The staff member looked visibly annoyed and aggravated, it made the atmosphere really weird. I asked for a coffee with coconut milk. It was only when I sat down my friend said to me he told me they only have oat milk so my coffee was not what I ordered and tasted burnt. In addition to that the baps where also burnt but I didnt bother saying anything because of the bad vibes coming off the guy working there. At one point another customer walked in and the guy swung his head back and rolled his eyes. Like what? No one likes working minimum wage jobs but get a grip. Overall really bad atmosphere which is a shame, used to visit this cafe regularly pre-pandemic and I loved it. This little corner cafe on the bank of the Liffey is a quirky, cool place - perfect for a date, a sit-down & chat, a quiet read or to watch the world go by. Emmet made great lattes and although very busy, was a great host. Service was quick & friendly - we shared a gluten free chocolate cake was gorgeous.  Its a small,  intimate, unique venue  full of character and well be back again. As we came out into a light drizzle,  a gorgeous rainbow filled the sky over the Hapenny Bridge- the happy end to a good day. What a view! Go there, generously tip the staff, enjoy a beverage and a slice of Dublin life. Very stlylish and climatic place in Dublin. Love the interior at first then become in love with the food and coffe , to be , at the end,  charmed by the service. Recommended Food : 5/5 Nice little place to stop for coffee. Does get busy at times but staff are friendly. Options for savoury bites or cakes. Pretty pricey but I think thats quite normal in Dublin from what I heard. Soya milk option! 0/5 Stars My hopes for a satisfying coffee experience were shattered at this small shop. From the neglected wet coffee puck to the dirty filter and uneven stamping, it was clear quality was lacking. The leftover milk and bitter taste only added to the disappointment. A regrettable and exhausting experience. I randomly found this place while waiting for a friend. I think the place is charming, you have a nice view of people passing by the street, the road, and the river when you sit on the high chairs  they also have books you can freely read  I think they might have music gigs here? But at the time I was there, there wasn t. Staffs are friendly, price is okay so I ve got nothing to complain Cosy coffee place with great view. Very narrow entrance. Friendly staff the baked food was not good, tasted stale. Interior design seems old, but still a friendly looking place. Tasty sandwich and decent view. Although would be nicer if the windows would be clean Nice and authentic place for a break. The staff was extremely friendly Great iced tea and nice athmosphere A nice little cafe on the quays of the Liffey. It wasnt our first time there, but we always enjoy going back. I really like the coffee there, albeit the Baileys cake we shared was not the best and I would probably try something different the next time. Always love the service there as staff is brutally honest in their recommendations. The service is also speedy. The atmosphere is cozy and doesnt have those overly money-making apparatus vibes many of the bigger cafes do. A great spot for watching life going by out the window and certainly a place well go back to many a time in the future! Great atmosphere, fun music in the background and super comfortable vibe. Coming from the United States, it s cafes like this in Dublin that I look for when I need a place to chill out and relax. The staff knows what they are doing and the drinks are fabulous.  Not looking for coffee? Try the beer, wine or water. 100% will come back. Highly recommend the dirty chai and buying a bag of loose leaf tea to take home. Walked a good ways to try out this cafe and work for a bit this afternoon... To find out they dont allow laptops?? I was really disappointed. Giant generic sign on their door to welcome you in with no laptops allowed. I understand their store is small, and they probably want to make sure theyre generating income, but theres other ways... One purchase per hour, 2 hour limit, etc. Or if its a branding decision, the sign should reflect that. Otherwise it just seems you dont like people who work or students. The sandwiches are amazing here, but the staff service is sometimes questionable, there is some very kind staff but other seem to appear visibly annoyed and rude. Beautiful coffee with greasy tasting espresso. Had a wonderful Americano and, with a little cream, a delicious latte-esque drink. Paninis were also superb! Lovely food, cool atmosphere and great music. Loved it!I Excellent Cafe. Good music. It takes them a while to prepare the order but its worth it. I went 2 days in a row because of how good everything was. 10/10 totally recommended. They don t allow laptops even when the space is empty. I was carrying a laptop, the polite thing to do would mention it as I was purchasing the coffee. The signs aren t visible until you go to sit at a table. Amazing coffee shop, amazing atmosphere with very good prices, ordered 2 flat whites and quality was very good, they do only take card for  anyone planning to pay cash  but overall great coffee shop Wheelchair accessibility: Accessible but door is somewhat small Great little cafe just over Capel street, Southside, on the corner. Plate glass windows give you a clear view of Capel Street bridge and the Liffey river. Its eclectic interior decoration, laid back friendly atmosphere made my stop for a latte very enjoyable. Staff were very professional, in these Covid times they took tracing details. They were warm and smiling and everyone entering were made feel relaxed and welcome. My first time there, but I will certainly be back! Very nice place for coffee and breakfast just along the Liffey River. Theres also often live music with local musicians (not trad though), and the cafe is a great spot for a glass of dry red wine or a tea after work or after going to the movies or dinner! On a wet afternoon in Dublin , we stopped by for a rest and a cup of tea. This place may look a bit like a student speakeasy, but the fare was first class. Cool tunes to vibe to, fresh, specialised options for teas and coffee and delicious pastry on offer. We stayed over an hour. The staff were as warm and friendly as the cosy atmosphere.  We will be back. One of the best coffees Ive ever had. Pleasant staff and good vibes. I would recommend 100%, especially if youre looking for a late night spot. Small quirky. Fits into this amazing old building on the ground floor. Huge old glass windows looking out over the Liffey and Parliament St Bridge. Coffees great too. Very varied menu. Free music every Friday evening with a glass of wine? What more could you need? Loved it!!! Had some good Chai Latte in a great atmosphere & was vibing to a superb selection of music. Staff was super friendly and positive  . Ill be back Edit: Breakfast is amazing too. When I enter They didnt even tell me good morning, or if the order was on the table or to pay before... I sat for a few minutes and they never came. I had to go to the registers and say I wanted a coffee and brownie... and the brownie was very hard and cold! Terrible service Excellent coffee plus sweet service is a great combination in this lgbtq friendly cafe place. Its also worth mentioning a good selection of interesting books. Great location, good collection of tea, good collection of pastries (although a single pastel de nata costs a whopping  3.25). But the staff arent very friendly. Probably the worst tasting milkshake I ve ever had. The chocolate cake is likewise too sweet. Pure sugar. The atmosphere is nice. Edit: thanks for the reply! Adding a banana instead of sugar would make the milkshake infinitely better. Enjoyed this place, stumbled across it. Loverly location with nice tall windows, staff were freindly and overall a good little independent cafe. (Just to note, they have a no sitting with laptops policy, but i think that is fair enough!!) the thing is the vibe of the coffee shop is actually really nice but the staff working is always really rude. they don t welcome you, don t talk to you, don t smile at you and really just ignore the customers It is a very unique place where you can sit and enjoy a good coffee or a excellent Galician beer! What a gem!!!! Cute little cafe with great tea selection, coffee wine and light food  really cozy and they have a pretty amazing setup with a band playing in the loads. When I was there, the band was just saying it! The views are not too shabby either  all in all a great find I love this place. Delicious sweet treats too. Tried the iced oat latte and iced oat chai latte. Both amazing. Food : 5/5"
187,The National Wax Museum Plus,4.175,"This is just a fun place to visit. From dinosaurs to faerie history you get an entertaining wax museum with a number of interactive activities and exhibits. Nice staff and of course the obligatory store at the end of the exhibit. They even have a haunted house section with a couple of very effective jump scares. Went here twice, don t know why I did as I seem to be deathly afraid of the wax figures.. I cried the first time I visited from sheer terror. The second time I went I was pleased to see Game of Thrones figures and a Hannibal Lector, but I can t help but feel the eyes of the figures watch me as I walk through the rooms. Some of the figures definitely look better than others but all of them are fear inducing. Tickets are also a bit overpriced but that s Dublin for you. If you re at a loss for something to do then go for the experience, but if you re terrified of wax figures like me, maybe reevaluate your decisions Very beautiful statues and very interesting museum We had a lovely time with the family But the visit is quite short and not necessarily worth the price. The haunted hotel part is very nice but be careful with children it can scare them The staff are very friendly and welcoming and have made a lot of effort to reduce the language barrier Ireland s f wax museum was set up in 1804 by and has had many reincarnations since. Scientists, artists, and those who fall somewhere in between have been obsessed with creating the perfect fake human for centuries. As early as the Middle Ages, wax figures representing deceased royals and clergymen were displayed to allow the living to pay their respects  in person  to the objects of their veneration. It is a unique museum with an extensive collection of wax figures, interactive exhibits, and immersive experiences, providing visitors with an entertaining and educational journey through Irish history, culture, and popular culture. My favourite part is a corner with Irish scientist names, also was good to recognize figures without reading wall stend. It was okay, we purchased tickets on groupon so it only cost us around PS11 each for a ticket. Characters are dated and a lot of younger visitors wouldnt really know who they were looking at etc. I personally wouldnt go again if I was to return to Dublin but if your visiting the city and have 30 minutes to waste then pop in. Very interesting place. The figures are not made 100% realistic but the layout is great and quite interactive. The spooky hotel was a good one! Recommend to those visiting Dublin Its a nice little museum although the scenes and characters are a bit mixed and disparate. We had a good time there but if I have to compare with Grevin, I would say that it costs a little expensive  18 for a 1h30 visit if you really take the time We went, the family rated it neat and cool.  It has many photo op places, has history, science, a mirror maze, a horror section, and a neon like section - Tir Na Nog.  Overall it was enjoyable.  Good to check out with a family You should buy your tickets ahead of time. Visited on Our visit to the Wax Museum in Dublin was a unique and enjoyable experience that offered a twist on traditional wax museums. What set this museum apart was its blend of entertainment, education, and a touch of science and technology. Inside, we encountered a diverse array of wax figurines, some of which were instantly recognizable celebrities, while others were intriguing discoveries. Although the realism of the figurines varied, they still provided great photo opportunities and added to the overall fun. The fact that some were animatronic added an exciting element to the visit, making the figures come to life in a way we hadnt expected. One of the highlights was braving the horror walk, a spine-tingling experience that had me holding onto my boyfriends hand for dear life. It was genuinely scary but undeniably a lot of fun, and we couldnt help but laugh at our own reactions afterward. If you happen to have the Go City Pass, as we did, I would definitely recommend including the Wax Museum in your itinerary. Its a delightful blend of entertainment and a touch of the unexpected, making it a worthwhile stop for a unique Dublin experience. Went on a whim while in Dublin (on the Hop On/Off buses!) and gotta say... it was really fun!  Great mix of Irish history and just fun characters.  We went around Halloween which was fantastic... got a great haunted house experience too!  Glad we went and would recommend if youre in Dublin looking for something fun and different to do. Wow, enter at ur own risk the chamber of horror will have u quaking in your boots!!!!! Super thrilling, the rest was ultimately JEPIC !!!! iykyk !! Lots of love from Bradford, signed Emily + Alex Not great!  Especially compared to other waxworks Ive visited in London and Europe. Lovely staff.  Tried to be helpful, without being pushy. Visited on Very nice museum and really nice staff. My daughter was scared the entire visit. There are very interesting facts to read in the first part of the visit and also another part with history of Ireland, very interesting. I would love to see some more areas for kids as there is only one room with cartoons and movie characters. The Mirror maze is funny! It s also very well located in city center and plenty of public transport to get there The museum is super complete! We thought we would only see a few wax statues and in fact not at all! Its much more complete with a historical/scientific part, wax statues with pop culture, music or politics, then a haunted hotel which is very scary etc etc. In short, it was magical and worth the price. The idea is nice and some theme rooms were made quite pretty. But reading the info or listening to the info movie was hardly possible in  some areas due to more info coming from loud speakers or disturbing noises. I guess its a nice place for families with children, but the ticket price is a bit too high for what you get. 9 year old loved it, in the beginning felt a bit mish mashed collection but then flowed better. A good place to do some fun selfies with Father Ted and Co.....also can pay 11e to get your hand sculptured/ dipped into wax. A wonderful stop in my first international trip.  An absolute delight! Very beautiful museum with lots of different worlds, it is set up like a little tour. Great location and wonderful exhibit! Front desk person (Turkish or Eastern European) wasn t very polite - my impression is it was a racial thing seeing how he was very friendly with others. Strikes me as a bit funny given how he himself is very obviously not Irish and could barely speak English. Lovely experience otherwise but I wish management would hire polite front desk employees - I m spending tourist dollars here - least I expect is basic manners and English from your front desk staff. Arrived before ticket time, but no problem going in early. Good fun. Lots of science info and exhibits. Would be nice if more of the interactive pieces were working Only about 50% doing anything. Total visit about 1 hrs 45 mins. We visited here as an attraction including the within the GoDublin city pass. We would not pay the normal price off c. 19 to visit here as we felt the attraction was somewhat disappointing. The quality of the waxworks was OK, but we found the experience a bit stale. If you have a GoDublin pass and a free 30mins then do pop in, but otherwise we wouldnt recommend paying the normal entrance fee for the experience you get. An odd experience - half the museum is great, new, looked after - the history and fairytale portions are amazing! But that s the second half of their path through the museum. In the first half, it s oddly careless - buttons that don t work/do nothing, a wheelchair lift loaded with trash bags in their waxworks room in the middle of a busy Saturday, and a claustrophic room of elderly waxworks all shoved in tight together. It s a shame the tour starts with the bad and ends with the good. Nice experience, mostly random characters: batman, harry potter, david bowie, james bond, the pope etc... but there was some Ireland related figures. All wax statues were really nice quality. A bit expensive for whats inside but the other attractions (mirror maze, picture stand, etc...) made up for it. I give it five stars just for the amusement factor. It was outdated, and a lot of the interactive elements are not working, but it was so bad that its awesome   I had a lot of fun! Good museum, we had a good time with our kids from 6 to 11. Some equipment does not work though, but it is nice to see some are very old fashioned . I also wished more women were featured, would be great to make invisible Irish women more visible if and when the museum is refreshed   ! The electric chair attraction is of very bad taste in my view. We had two hours to spare and it wasn t busy when we got there so we did the tour in an hour and a half. It was fun and there was a wide variety of displays covering icons, animation characters and a brief history of Ireland. At the end we made a wax model of our hand for an additional cost but a great souvenir for the day. I was worried my son wouldn t recognise enough to enjoy it but there was enough to suit his age. There were stairs to climb up and down and I m not sure if an alternative was available so if mobility/stairs are an issue, you d need to check first. Overall we enjoyed our visit but you couldn t spend the whole day here. You would want to combine it with another activity in the day to really appreciate it. I did buy the tickets in advance but on our visit there was no need to. Staff were very nice. They offered to take a photo for an additional charge as well but we re not pushy when we turned them down for this. Other than our souvenir hand, we did not buy anything from the gift shop on this occasion, although we did get a small prize from a vending machine game. We had a great time visiting this museum, the price is a little excessive for the quality of the services offered. The location of the characters was a bit messy. However, the staff was very pleasant, smiling and understanding regarding the language barrier. We went there at a rainy day and spent there about an hour and a half. It was very interesting. You had the chance to interact with the exhibition. There were only little lines you werent allowed to cross so you were able to take pictures right next to the sculptures and get the best funniest pictures. Theres a horror part featuring Hannibal lectre and a small setting of shining. The horror part is optional, so you dont have to walk through it and just skip it. The museum represented important Irish people very interesting and interactive to the visitor. The employees were really nice and they even advised you to take many pictures. I can highly recommend visiting the museum to everyone spending time in dublin A good 1st stop for our Saturday afternoon in Dublin. Friendly staff gave us 10% off for entry and we got a photo souvenir and a Batman logo magnet upon departure. Recommend a visit...not far from Ashton Quay... Dublin castle   a short walk too... Wax museum in Dublin I hadnt seen any post about it And i think it is not appreciated enough. My teens really loved it. The are science room with a lot of displays and explanations, scary room with all classic bad guys end more. I mean, it seemed very small, compared to years ago before it moved. There were some interesting statues and stories to read. The haunted hotel was fun and scary. But pricey for what youre getting, but they do students discounts which is a bonus It was a lovely experience, if you are having a tour around Dublin i recommend visiting it for an hour, I also recommend visiting the basement floor as it is much better than the upstairs one! We loved our time here. It was fun being silly and going through all the rooms and doing all the activities. Great thing to do if you have already bought the Dublin pass. A wonderful museum of wax figures.  Lots of experiences and fun. We had a great time, pleasantly surprised, diverse and varied worlds which meant that we were able to do it with our 11 month old daughter, the adult part clearly defined. The people at reception are very nice. I totally recommend! Pretty cool place, but a little creepy if you ask me. The staff was nice, and the hand wax station was cool. Fun to visit, science part at the start is very interesting and interactive. Great to see wax people from our history. Lots for kids to see. Horror area might be a bit scary for young kids, but it can be skipped. Visited on Its a good tour good day out. Visited today with my daughter, the lady on reception I think her name was Imelda she was so lovely and friendly. We both had lots of fun my daughter loved all the Irish history part as she is studying that in school. On the way out she got a wax model of her hand and the lady that done was was so friendly and nice. Excellent visit today. Thank you. It was by chance that we came across this museum while we were looking for an activity to do, and what a cool discovery! This museum really has nothing to envy of the Grevin museum. The wax statuses found here are partly taken from pop culture and films. My favorite part was the one devoted to horror film characters. A real treat ! I will go back without hesitation!"
188,The Pepper Pot,4.575,"Lovely place to have breakfast. This was our first time but we ll be back. Generous portions and all tasted so fresh. Staff were also very friendly. Absolutely incredible brunch! Had the pear & bacon sando (they were fantastic about peanut allergies - felt very safe). Partner had the Turkish eggs said they had great flavours. Highly recommend- this place should have a higher star rating! Dietary restrictions: Great understanding of food allergies and food safety regarding cross contamination. Best breakfast, delicious scrambled egg, home made bread, perfect pastries! Must visit- a lovely location! I had one of the best sandwiches of my life here. The pear and bacon sandwich they re known for is on delicious, soft, but crusty freshly baked bread. Everything on the sandwich pairs perfectly together. A bean soup was on special and that was incredible as well. The brownie is soft and deliciously flavorful. The ambiance of the setting was very nice as well. I ll dream about this place when I am home in the US. Might even pick up a to go sandwich before I head to the airport in a few days! The most delicious and gorgeous Victorias sponge cake with the best atmosphere! Love it! What a great find in Powerscourt upstairs amazing view with outdoor type of seating indoors The bread is what you come for because oh my! This is one of the best breads I have ever had. It was soft, bouncy, and perfect. The shop itself is inside a larger building with many shops so it can be a bit tricky to find at first. You must order before sitting down (they will then give you a table). I am so amazed by this place, it is absolutely stunning and beautiful. It is a lovely spot to have lunch or breakfast, delicious food and drinks. I was there for a drink with my friend, we had a kombucha mimosa cocktail with raspberry that was absolutely delicious and refreshing. I can t wait to come back there for brunch soon. The pepper pot an amazing place for lovely brunch or breakfast. We had salmon bagels and scrambled eggs . Highly recommend  . Definitely would visit this beautiful place again Was raining and we googled in a cafe and this one came up. Walked straight past it few times didnt know it was there. Was lovely food and coffee. Glad we found it. Lovely view and not too crowded. A must for their black pudding salad , cakes and daily specials.  A pretty unique cafe for a treat, excellent tasty food, quick service, cute crockery and absolutely gorgeous surroundings of greenery. thanks to fionn for being a great waiter! highly recommend this place for brunch :) Magnificent place, unsuspected behind a flower shop. A mismatched dinnerware set that gives the impression of being at home with Irish flavors! Absolutely worth discovering! Rude and unpleasant staff After standing in the queue for nearly half an hour to place an order, while my mum, who is not very mobile, sat at a table waiting with my daughter, we had one person in front of us when we were told we had to give up our table. We were addressed in a very unpleasant manner despite another member of staff telling us earlier we could remain seated because of my mum s mobility issues. Visit if you want to be treated with disrespect. Great quality food served on a terrace over looking the most beautiful Georgian shopping centre! I really enjoyed my brunch - Pepper Pot BLT Bagel! So delicious. Love the freshness of all the ingredients involved.  Free range bacon was perfectly crisp, not too fatty. The bagel was toasted just right. It s a very busy place but definitely worth the wait. Service was friendly and efficient. Food came quick enough. Didn t get a chance to try the sweets but they look amazing! Will save some room for dessert next time. Paying for your bill is a bit confusing though. You have to go to the counter to pay but that s also where people are queuing for a table. Just a bit messy and the space is so tight. Need improvement on this front I think. Delicious food and lovely staff. Seating is along the shopping centre corridor and can be very very busy. The scrambled eggs sounds too basic to order but is somehow amazing. I miss them opening on Sundays a lot. Wheelchair accessibility: 3-4 tables would be very accessible, the rest might be awkward to get to without navigating steps or squeezing past other tables There was a long line to get a table and we had to order immediately before sitting down which felt rushed. It s a cool location tho and the food was all right. This is a great little hidden gem! When I lived in Dublin it was a regular spot of mine and since moving away from Dublin, completely forgot about it! So happy I stumbled across this spot again! The scrambled eggs are always cooked to perfection and Ill definitely be back again! Food here is worth the price and wait time. The homemade bread is delish. Their  aubergine sandwich is heavenly!!! The one with pear, bacon and cheddar is also really good. Highly recommend these 2. One of my favourite cafe in Dublin. I love sitting in the terrace while enjoying the atmosphere of the Powerscourt Centre. They offer good coffees, cakes, and sandwiches. Strongly recommend! Nice staff. Good views. But the bacon pear sambo is the reason for the season. The bread alone, I would give away my first born for. Fancy place. I really like it.    Good dessert Such a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch or just tea. Service is excellent, food and pastries are freshly made and delicious. Here for the ambience and fancy crockery n teapots Looked for a child friendly breakfast restaurant. This came up . Someone described it as the  best  breakfast in town  . NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! Confused staff, incorrect instructions , my son fell off his seat and got hurt   not one staff member came to see if all was ok . Paid first and had to tip as option on debit card machine screen demanded so. To that point all had been self  service . Qued to pay and tip  before we got a table or food or   SERVICE !! Table , in a very small , cold , drafty stairwell , with a limited menu . Service   the person delivered our order to the people sitting at the drafty table next to us but who arrived well after we arrived . They alerted the staff . Food was  . Terrible . Burnt bacon sandwich . Burnt and cold sausage  sandwich with relish from the summer of 1987( when it was popular ) . Overall the only positive was the scrambled eggs and the bread . I took two things away from the experience. Sponsored search results are best avoided . Never tip before you have had service and tasted the food . Ultimately I have to blame myself for not researching better . It s a big fat 0 for the experience. 2 for the bread and eggs . Both are not hard to do . Expensive plate of scrambled eggs in reality . A nice place to take a break from shopping or sightseeing in Dublin. Particularly nice when piano is being played in the centre. The lemon and ricotta cake didnt look particularly impressive but it was so light and tasty. Cute little spot in. Delicious breakfast. Coffe not so great   A little pricey for a cappuccino and breakfast for one! There s also a service charge but it s kind of self serve Charming little restaurant well hidden in a walking gallery! Surprising places where we had the pleasure of brunching on the balcony surrounded by small shops Very pleasant and atypical  Alice in Wonderland  setting! Lovely place on the 1st floor in Powerscourt Town Centre. The bacon and pear sandwich was great. Loved the ricotta and lemon cake Order: sausage sandwich, pear sandwich, potato leek soup Verdict: fine. The bread was like Japanese milk bread and very tasty but stuff inside wasnt enough. Excelent Victorian sandwich and scones. Very poor service An unusual place to eat the best scrambled eggs in Dublin, but in the end its still scrambled eggs. Very little space and queue expected. Welcome with a smile. Very good dishes, based on bread (made by their bakery), the setting is very nice in this shopping center Great place for breakfast.  Very efficient and tasty food in a really gorgeous setting. Really wonderful meal, delicious options, and good portions! The staff were incredibly friendly, they were more than accommodating for our larger group! Fantastic scone paired with earl grey tea. The pumpkin soup was delish as well! Very nice! The service was excellent! We were served by Lucia. Shes great help polite and professional. Super cozy brunch spot in the heart of Dublin! Nice location and lots of options to choose from on the menu. Would recommend! One of my favourite spots in Dublin, food is tasty and very high quality, all made in store. The environment is also a plus, feels very comfy inside The Powerscourt centre. Beautiful place hidden behind a flower shop. The team is friendly and the food delicious."
189,The Phoenix Monument,4.55,"Beautiful monument at the center of the park with the irish presidential house on one side and US ambassador house on the other side... If you have luck you can get to see the deers jumping from one side of the walk way to the other side... Very green and beautiful picture scenes all over the park with blooming flowers. Magnificent park. Large expanses of greenery. It feels good to recharge your batteries. Monuments are throughout the park. You will even have the chance to come across a deer farm The monument is in a traffic circle on a columns with a statue that looks more like a chicken than the Phoenix. A very beautiful park almost 1700 acres. There is lot to do in this park.The Wellington Monument  is an obelisk. It  is situated at the southeast end of the Park, overlooking Kilmainham and the River Liffey. The structure is 62 metres tall, making it the largest obelisk in Europe built in 1817-1861 to commemorate the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. A monument in the middle of the lovely park, we had the pleasure to see the park all green and full in bloom. The bus tours that goes around the city passes this as well. Lovely monument located in the roundabout at Aras An Uachtarain.  The Phoenix Park is a fantastic spot for a walk any time of year. Beautiful Dublin&Relaxing time&Great memory. High Monument at the roundabout in the phoenix park. It isnt really a attraction. Sunday morning in the phonex Park in  October.  Looking lovely. The walk to the monument is ok, but the monument is not something spectacular. Walking by the west park trail, you might see some deers. Cute deers are around here Beautiful when the Sun is shinning, plenty of room for a picnic or just playing about with the kids. But dont let them climb to high up the monument it can be steep. Took part in the Remembrance Run 2022. Continue to Rest with Our Lord Daddy. He loves you more. Incredible amazing park. Try to rent a bike if possible because it is enormous! Visitors center great for a stroll. Exhibition area well worth a visit. The staff were very courteous and extremely helpfull. Its a great place to come and visit on a nice sunny day or whatever the weather but bring your kids bring a ball bring a frisbee bring a picnic lovely place to sit and watch the world go by Amazing park to walk, run or other activities. Dont miss the chance to visit that place in your trip through Dublin Nice place for a walk Just lovely, and the deers OMG! Massive park beautiful views! Looks great, especially during foggy evenings. With those lights up its very eery sight. Well....Phoenix Park is big. Great place to see a polo game, the zoo, or maybe the Pope. The monument is not the best part of Phoenix park, but walking there is really nice Grass, grass and more grass. Prefer other parks in the city unless you have planned a picnic. I didnt like this park. Wild deers inside the park Rode bikes around the park and everything was beautiful and so well maintained! Beautiful monument people stay there doing activites outside. A lovely spot to relax and always full of locals and tourists. Beautiful monument and a nice walk up to it Monument itself is nothing special. Park is great thought. Beautifull surroundings especially autumn colour Great day out! So much to see. One of the best parks in the world Recovery the soul Beautiful place. Lit up nicely at night Great spot to pass on a run. Highly recommend a visit here Better than a walk in the morning Fab views car park right beside it"
190,The Spire,4.375,"A very unique looking monument. It resembles a 120m tall metal needle.   So its easy to find and recognize, a perfect meeting point. We actually were on a mission to find this spire. Its an interesting landmark that towers over the city of Dublin. Its sleek - the design and height are pretty impressive. If youre in Dublin be sure to visit. The Spire, a towering monument of modern design, stands as an emblem of Dublins evolution and dynamism. Rising majestically from the heart of OConnell Street, it symbolizes the citys journey towards a vibrant, forward-thinking future while honoring its rich history and cultural heritage. Designed by British architect Ian Ritchie, the Spire was conceived as part of Dublins Millennium Spire project, a visionary endeavor to create a contemporary landmark for the new millennium. Its slender form, constructed from stainless steel, reaches an impressive height of 120 meters (almost 400 feet), soaring above the bustling streets below. The Spires construction marked a transformative moment for Dublin, replacing the once-iconic Nelsons Pillar, which had stood on the same site until its destruction in 1966. Unlike its predecessor, which celebrated British naval hero Horatio Nelson, the Spire represents a departure from historical associations, embracing a more inclusive and forward-looking vision for the city. Since its unveiling in 2003, the Spire has become an integral part of Dublins urban landscape, captivating residents and visitors alike with its sleek, minimalist design and commanding presence. Its reflective surface catches the sunlight by day, casting ever-changing patterns of light and shadow, while at night, it is illuminated by a dazzling array of LED lights, transforming it into a radiant beacon in the darkness. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Spire serves as a symbol of Dublins resilience, creativity, and cultural diversity. It stands as a testament to the citys ability to embrace change while staying true to its roots, embodying the spirit of innovation and progress that defines Dublin as a global capital. As a cherished landmark and meeting point, the Spire holds a special place in the hearts of Dubliners, serving as a gathering place for celebrations, protests, and moments of reflection. It stands as a reminder of Dublins ongoing transformation and its enduring spirit of resilience, unity, and hope for the future. Marvel at The Spire of Dublin, an iconic landmark soaring into the skyline at OConnell Street. This stunning monument, also known as the Monument of Light, stands 120 meters tall and is a celebrated piece of modern art and engineering. Its sleek, stainless steel surface catches the light and the eye of anyone walking down the street. The Spire is a must-visit for those interested in contemporary design and serves as a focal point in the heart of the city. Despite its modern origins, the Spire of Dublin has already accumulated its own legends. Some locals humorously claim it was designed to prevent pigeons from perching, while others see it as a beacon of hope, especially during Irelands Celtic Tiger economic boom. However, no official legend or myth surrounds the Spire; instead, it stands as a contemporary symbol of Dublins spirit and resilience. The Spire of Dublin is a magnificent landmark towering over the city. Its sleek design and impressive height make it a must-see attraction for visitors to Dublin.  Definitely worth a visit! The Spire OConnell St You can walk in the middle of the pavement to it but be aware cars pass through the road which can be deceiving. There are plenty of tours passing here, in native languages and usually stop to discuss the rich history and culture of Dublin. It s cool, I guess.  It s just a giant pole that goes into the sky.  The symbolism is cool. This 120 meter high needle is the symbol of the city of Dublin. The guide told us that this place is called an excellent place for meetings, because it is the most famous and visible attraction, because it is convenient for people to arrange a meeting in this place since everyone knows where it is. This needle also has a long history, which at the same time symbolizes the unbroken spirits of the country s journey into the 21st century. The stiletto in the ghetto the guy at the Big Bus said. Impressive! In the middle of everything next to Mail Building. Great place to take pictures! What a beautiful landmark at the heart of Dublin City!! It s crowded but it s fun.. Such a wonderful place to adopt a dog. After our dog Bosco was put to sleep we went to Meekstown to adopt a dog. We took Daisy a lurcher home. Unfortunately it didnt work out as our place wasnt big enough to give her the freedom she deserved.  After ringing Maggie she told us to take her back to them. Such lovely lovey staff. Daisy ran off with her handler and i felt better knowing she was in great hands. I highly reccomend this dogs aid as staff are absolutely fantastic. We will definitely be back to look for another fur friend. Thankyou. Liz The true heart of Dublin  My Irish friend told me that if you look up the Spire right beneath it, you feel like seeing the Spire going endlessly up to the sky like the Tower of Babel.. Truly amazing feature on the street The Spire is impressive to see and stand next to. Worth the walk to see this monument when in Dublin, Ireland. Dublin spire is pretty cool.   It s in one of the main tourist and shopping area of the city.  It s a good photo souvenir of your visit and it s free.   No tickets need just walk up and get your photo. I didnt want to be mean and give this 1 star so 2 stars because if you look up, you can find your way back to OConnell Street by looking for stiffy as the locals call it. Its modern art but I dont see the beauty of it and it just looks out of place in a city full of so many beautiful statues. The Spire also called as Monument of Light at Dublin, in pure stainless steel is a symbol of modern architectural installation, 120 my height and pure delight, also this acts as a point to locate central Dublin for newcomers.. Best an greatest Landmark ever, absolute must see! Added is a photo of me and the Spire. The major importance of the Spire (also nicknamed the Needle) was that it could be seen from afar, so it was very useful when we were looking for directions. It was monumental, but frankly we dont know what to see or what should be expected from it. A photo spot maybe, but thats it.  One might be able to spend three to five minutes there, and after reading through the descriptions, nothing more can one do with it. The beauty of the Spire is that it commemorates nothing but toasts Dublins bustling present and points forward towards a limitless, brighter, and more prosperous future. Worth a visit. You cant miss seeing the spire when youre in Dublin City centre even when you dont have the plan to see this. This is in the heart of Dublin with 120 mts height. So many food joints and shops nearby.  The bus stop tram stop is all very near to the spire. The construction was completed in 2003 and this is the tallest man made structure in Ireland. During night time you can see the light at the top from most of the places in Dublin City which you can use to know which direction youre in the City. Located on OConnell street at the Henry st entrance, is this 120 meter high tapered structure, like an over size needle. It is not a very pleasant place except by the representation of that tall pillar, so to speak, it is a crowded place with tourists in transit, full of gypsies of Romanian origin, drug addicts and beggars. The tall needle like momument is one of the tallest structures in Dublin and can be seen from afar. Uo close its perhaps not as striking. Yet it is unique and worth some pictures. The Dublin Spire, also known as the Monument of Light, is a modern and iconic landmark. It s the meeting point of most of the people A very simple looking sculpture, yet so beneficial landmark,  located on OConnell Street.   I normally use the spire to identify where my exact spot when I am in Dublin.   Im aware now that  its worth the cost to build it.  ( 4M) I just visited the Spire Sculpture in Dublin, and it was really cool! Its this really tall, shiny thing right in the middle of the city. You cant miss it! It stands on OConnell Street, which is a busy place. The Spire looks like a giant needle reaching up into the sky. Its super shiny, especially when the sun is out. At night, it lights up and looks even more amazing. People call it the Monument of Light, which makes sense because it really shines bright! Lots of people hang out around the Spire. Tourists take pictures with it, and locals meet up there. Its like a meeting spot for everyone in Dublin. I think the Spire is a really cool symbol of the city. Its simple but really striking. It shows how modern and vibrant Dublin is. Whether youre visiting Dublin for the first time or you live here, you should definitely check out the Spire. Its a cool piece of art that makes the city even more special. 3 stars, I dont really see the purpose of this thing in the middle of the avenue. 120 m high I think. Its not great. Besides, no one looks up. Didnt know anything about The Spire, until we went to Dublin for the day. A truly inspiring and amazing piece of sculpture and engineering I must say it was my fast time to go there a friend recommended me it was around summer time but my Goodness it was so amazing lots of people huge place enough for family and friends hangouts plus parties you should try it you won t regret it. This is the Portal between Dublin and New York so if you know someone there you can arrange to wave at them. A live portal beside it, showing videos of portal at the other side of the world, like in New York The Spire consists of eight hollow stainless steel cone sections, the longest being 20 m (66 ft), which were installed on 21 January 2003. ... It is an ... Antenna spire: 120 m (393.7 ft) Cost:  4,000,000 Location: Dublin, Ireland Construction started: 2002 Not sure how a metal skewer could be the  beacon for the city of Dublin  but nonetheless it is a beacon for tourists and a way of getting your bearings as it can be spotted from a good distance away ( if the view is clear enough ) It nice to see it once, also since it is in the city centre and close to the recently built New York Video Portol, the trip could be made to include a variety of stuff Best reference point for travel in Dublin. Walking around to other attractive sites is easier and never lost. Very beautiful and useful place. The Spire of Dublin, alternatively titled the Monument of Light , is a large, stainless steel, pin-like monument 120 metres (390 ft) in height, located on the site of the former Nelsons Pillar and statue of William Blakeney on OConnell Street in Dublin, Ireland. In the 1990s, the streets were not that attractive to the eye. Trees were overgrowing in these streets and several shops were there. The trees had been growing for centuries.The idea of cutting them off was brought but it was criticised by many people. Statues were cleaned and relocated to other places. The plastic signage and frontage were required to be replaced with more attractive designs. idea of the Spire of Dublin was brought up to replace the monument for Nelson s Pillar. It was chosen from a large number of submissions in an international competition that was chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Joe Doyle. A landmark of Dublin, The Spire was constructed in 2003 as a replacement for Nelsons Pillar, which stood on the same site before it was blown up by Irish Republicans in 1966, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. The architect of The Spire was British architect Ian Ritchie, who won a design competition launched by Dublin City Council in 1997. It looks cool, but maybe I expected something a bit more breathtaking. Having climbed The Pillar back in 1963, l like this spot and consider The Spire a fitting substitute."
191,The Stage Door Cafe,4.75,"You must stop in here for breakfast! Amazing service and food, and it s open early. The staff is hilarious and efficient. So glad we happened upon this place! We had a short wait that was well worth it. I recommend the Irish Breakfast! Fantastic breakfast in the heart   of Temple Bar.  We ordered the Brie Bacon sandwich with egg on top and a traditional Irish breakfast.  Both were fantastic.  Staff were friendly and funny.  It was very busy so a bit of a wait but worth it. Once we got out of the taxi we were greeted with open arms. The atmosphere and the positive energy from the owner was amazing. Alan, the owner , is a joy. His conversations and recommendations are the best. Definitely a place to visit as a tourist. Cute little hole in the wall spot that opens early. Make sure you go because he is counting down to retirement. Thanks Alan for the love. Great food, great service, great atmosphere! The Irish Breakfast was amazing. The food was seasoned to perfection, and the Irish Coffee was smoothe and delicious. All employees definitely make you feel like you are part of the family. Everyone should at least experience this amazing location and find out for yourselves. The best at it gets for an Irish breakfast.  More than the breakfast their server was amazing and he made our day. A combination of both made a 5* breakfast combo. Must do the scramble eggs ... So well done and the sandwich which was awesome  . A must visit ... Cracking little breakfast spot! So cosy and warm inside. We were a little unsure of where to go for breakfast, and the sign stating they had the best breakfast in Dublin intrigued us. Safe to say it did not disappoint! Phenomenal food made fresh but served quickly, just what you want when you ve had a night out at the surrounding pubs and bars the night before. Large portion sizes and great value for money. Our waiter with the man bun (so sorry I didn t catch your name!) was friendly and attentive, and recommended some fab places for us to go for drinks later on in the day. Great little find and would definitely recommend! We walked in near closing time on Tuesday and got some awesome Irish hospitality, still more than happy to serve us Aussie family of 4 our first Irish coffee. Great coffee and a cute Irish chef with tattoos. I know where Ill be coming if I go to Dublin again. Even gave us some local knowledge, a list of nearby Irish pubs that youll actually get a seat in. Thanks guys! Alan was a delight, puts everyone at easy, funnier than all the comics we went to see the previous night at a comedy club. The Irish coffee was more Irish than coffee with a full Irish breakfast to die for. We especially like the Vegan option that was on offer although we didn t go for it Hope your knees hold up a bit longer Alan, EVERYONE who ever visits Dublin needs to be able to enjoy the dining experience on offer at the Stage Door Cafe For those that never order Irish Coffee, its not your typical coffee   great atmosphere and most importantly the Irish breakfast is really good! The lollipop at the end is a small reward for all of us babies..... Went in for a full Irish breakfast my first morning in country. Got bullied into drinking whisky in my coffee at 8 in the morning by the staff. 10/10 would recommend. Great food and even better staff We were recommended the Stage Door Cafe by a friend, and it did not disappoint! As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted like old friends. The staff couldnt do enough for us, and the chef owner was full of banter! A lovely breakfast served with the famous Irish hospitality. We landed in Dublin from Canada and this was a great and fun place to be introduced to the Irish culture. The servers were really fun and outspoken. We tried the Irish breakfast and the location was perfect. The owner was very funny. The food was good but the service was a bit bad, they forgot to bring out a dish and instead of hurrying they told you that they would bring it out in 2 minutes. 1 hour there and they dont take 3 courses. Perhaps the solution is to take the orders on paper to avoid these mistakes Our first breakfast in Ireland and this place is a home run!!! Food-excellent. Setting is cozy and warm with outdoor tables as well. 2 of the young gents(including our waiter) went out of their way to provide insight on good hikes and attractions. The outward friendliness is just so appealing and welcoming. Highly recommended! Open very early for travelers arriving early. The staff was friendly and humorous. Food was delicious and atmosphere perfect! Irish Breakfast and Irish coffee was amazing. Such a fun time and a cozy place which is great after a long flight! After a long six hour flight from America we spotted this gem and boy oh boy we hit the JACKPOT! the staff was amazing atmosphere was comfortable yet mesmerizing inside and out! We were welcomed with open arms and greeted by a  lovely young lad who help recommend few places which was great not knowing where to begin!. Ultimately we sure did get the ultimate full Irish breakfast and couldn t forget the baileys hot chocolate TO DIE FOR!!!!   when we return we will definitely be goin back (home)  the stage door cafe   our ultimate favorite spot above all! (Honeymooners spot) A must-visit restaurant at the foot of Temple Bar to enjoy a real Irish breakfast, in an Irish atmosphere and where everyone is well received, children too! Thank you for this delicious moment Perfect Irish Breakfast, everything you would expect from such a place! The staff is very funny and welcoming. Go for it!!! It lives up to the title of the best Irish breakfast traditional in the City Centre.Brazilian staff and irish chef are incredible. We are welcomed. I strongly recommend this spot. Vegetarian options: Cheese omelette with mushrooms What a hidden gem! A friend recommended this cafe for breakfast and it was amazing! The cafe is small, but cozy with little tables and seating areas. There is wood trim and stained glass, along with nicknacks that make you smile. The staff is very friendly and genuinely care about your well being. Theyll chat you up and youll have new friends by the time you walk out! The food was fantastic and plentiful. I highly recommend the full Irish breakfast. Treat yourself to an Irish coffee while youre at it! Enjoy! A very nice cafe where you can apparently eat the best Irish breakfast. Well were not from Dublin so we had to try it. There was a very long queue waiting to be seated at 10:30am. We had to wait like 30 minutes to have a table outside. It was really sunny this morning so it was pretty nice but I think that its inside of the cafe that you can live the full experience. I just went to pay and it was so lively and charming. The Irish breakfast was truly nice. We had an egg (sunny side up, my fav), sausages well grilled, baked beans (not too sugary. They were perfect for me), bacon, white and black pudding and bread. Everything was tasty, nicely cooked and I had a wonderful time. I was full for like 8 hours so it was more like a brunch than a breakfast for me, but I have quite a small appetite. My boyfriend wanted a cookie 4 hours after so I suppose it depends. The waiters were really nice, especially the one at the counter. The prices were quite okay I guess. 13  for an Irish breakfast. It used to be less expensive but it was like 5 years ago so its understandable. I recommend it! Loved this spot. Came here per a friend s recommendation and we were glad we did. We came around 11:30am on a Sunday and we had to wait a little bit (the restaurant is quite cozy) but it wasn t too bad. We each had an Irish breakfast, which you could see being made right in front of the open kitchen. Cash only. Indoor and outdoor dining available. The service was lovely - a bit snarky but all in good humor. I also liked how the food was cooked fresh to each order, so while there was a wait when there was a rush, the patience is worth it. This was the first restaurant we went to Ireland. Our flight arrived way too early on weekend morning. The owner was extremely friendly and gave us some good laughs. There are Irish Breakfast was born on the best Irish Breakfast we have tried out of about 7 different places so far. Definitely stop by and check the place out and meet the owner. This place is a must if you re in Dublin for breakfast. The owner, who also cooks every meal himself, is hilarious. All the staff is lovely, the Irish coffee delicious and the food is killer. Portion sizes are huge and taste is great. Spoke with the owner for a bit after we ate and what a great guy he is, thank you for our most memorable meal while visiting Ireland! I had the best Irish breakfast Ive ever had at this restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious, and their coffee was amazing. The staff were incredibly friendly and funny, they made the experience even more enjoyable. We had to wait outside in the cold for like 15 min but it was so worth it! I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fantastic traditional Irish breakfast with great service! What a beautiful experience in such a hidden gem! Alan is a top tier guy with a heart of gold, and a very talented chef! Such a delightful breakfast and coffee! Would absolutely recommend to anyone travelling to Dublin! Stage door cafe is hilarious Go to it and see.. Breakfast is big and good. A very nice place and open from 06:00 Food : 5/5 | Brilliant breakfast spot, would highly recommend for a super friendly and welcoming place. The owner is a real character. Fantastic service. Really friendly staff and a lovely breakfast (with big portions!). Reasonably priced for Dublin. Graham was also amazing when it came to customer service and recommendations with what to do in Dublin. Would highly recommend this place. Have been there 2 out of 2 days I have been in Dublin. Doesnt disappoint! Great little spot for a full Irish breakfast! Opens early which was perfect after our transatlantic flight landed at 5am. Server was friendly and gave us good Dublin recommendations. This was a great way for us to start our Ireland trip. Pro tip: dont get anything vegetarian! As a (non- ) vegetarian (and German) I have to say that the food was super delicious and the staff were great! Definitely worth a visit. We had breakfast there based on all the enthusiastic comments found here! And what a disappointment.. If you find yourself in a typical place, with staff who like to chat with their customers, the food was catastrophic.. unless you are a fan of fat bars. I ordered a sandwich and what a surprise when they brought me two slices of barely burnt bread with bacon, cheddar and an egg on top! An order error certainly, reported and for which I was told  it s an open sandwich  (yet surprisingly the table next to me had a decent sandwich). The mocha wasnt a mocha, just a black coffee with a foamy layer on top. And if you like something sweet, move on, there s none on the menu. In short, extremely disappointed by this place given the price (because we still get almost 40  for 2 for that) Instantly felt so welcome. What a guy the owner is! So bubbly, attentive and hilarious! The coffee was strong and amazing. Food was lovely too. Great little authentic irish cafe. We left with a list of recommended bars to try and a little bit warmer after a drop of complimentary whiskey! We were wondering through the streets of Dublin looking for somewhere to eat breakfast. A man who was cleaning the streets asked if we were looking for breakfast and directed us to this place. It was a little hard to find at first, but once we were there we were greeted and placed in the gay corner. I had a coffee and an Irish breakfast my wife had the same but with Tea. When we had finished, the owner gave us some sites to visit and recommend some local taverns to visit. This place Id definitely worth the visit if you are stuck for inspiration of where to visit while enjoying a friendly atmosphere while eating g some good traditional Irish food. I am looking forward to the next visit. Food was good and portions were very large. One of the people working there was very talkative with patrons and gave recommendations for things to do. So you want to experience a real Irish breakfast in Temple Bar and you dont have any idea of where to go. So thats the place. Small, cozy, often crowded, the Stage Door Cafe will welcome you and let you experience an excellent genuine Irish Breakfast. The place is not that big so you might have to wait for a table, but thats ok. Breakfast costs around 14 , coffee 4 . People are friendly and even when its crowded (almost always) the service is fast. Dont miss it out. Great place! We stopped by here by chance looking for breakfast. It s not very big, quite intimate, older fashioned but a great spot nonetheless. The food was great, well portioned and delicious and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I had the BLT with an egg on top accompanied with an Irish coffee. Amazing. Food and a comedy show. You can t ask for a better experience. Allen and his staff are hilarious. They don t like vegetarians so don t go if you are. The food was really good. We enjoyed every minute there. We laughed the whole time. Our lattes were amazing. The Irish breakfasts were awesome. This is a man who loves what he does. I have no idea how this place got elected beat breakfast of Dublin. People leaving reviews were either receiving free food or had no former experience with real breakfast. No choice for how you wish to have your eggs cooked, fried, poached or scrubbed. No tomatoes, no mushrooms, very average sausages and beacon. Lads, Ireland has so much more to offer, stay away."
192,The Sweetest Thing,4.85,"Great dessert place with a big selection of cheesecakes and other cakes. The banoffee pie was great and the Oreo one was pretty nice as well. They came with some extra sweet sauces and cream on the side which go pretty well together. The place is fairly small so you need to either wait a bit or be lucky to be empty. Would try some of the other cakes for sure This small cafe located in the center of Dublin, 2 minutes walking distance from one of the most beautiful bridges in the city - Hapenny Bridge. Its perfect for a quick breakfast, or a stop for a delicious dessert. I started the day with a croissant sandwich and a Baileys cheesecake, as I couldnt resist so many dessert options. Totally worth a try! This centrally located cafe on the banks of the Liffey is another favorite where my sister & I are regulars. The staff are friendly, kind, helpful & efficient, always offering a smiling welcome. The coffee is great and the food is delicious. There is an accessible toilet on the ground floor and if the inside is full, then there is seating outside under a canopy that might be more suitable for wheelchair users. There is a loyalty card scheme so our last coffee there recently was free! Fabulous :) The carrot and walnut cake was mouth watering.. it was really delicious. It s just a small place and tables can be so close to each other but the cake, dessert and coffee options are really good. This day was so special to me and I just wanted to celebrate with something sweet. I couldnt make up my mind over what cake I should try so the cafe owner picked the black forest for me and it was the best Ive tried! I had a cappuccino as well... the cafe is so cosy and comfortable The people working there are so sweet! Loved the place. #dublincafes #bestcafeexperience #cake #coffee #cafesinireland #coffeeshop #cakes #hygienic Really good cakes, coffee and genuine Irish atmosphere. Bonus * because they kept my bag of recently purchased scents I forgot when we left. Came back some minutes later and they gave it back to me instantly Yes 5 stars. Heres why. The cake and sweets selection. Loads of them. All of amazing. But i must recommend to you all their Banoffee cake. Its heavenly delicious, and came back thrice just for the Banoffee. The staff are warm and welcoming. Genuinely nice I must say. The place is small but cozy and clean. Can go bit crowded but that is expected as they do really good on customers. Will defo be coming back. If you need a sugar high, find this place. My Mum and I shared a lemon curd Muffin at  2.90, 2 regular lattes at  3.50 each and Lemon meringue at  5.50. Mum raved about the muffin. The lemon meringue was lovely but I would have preferred it without the cream and white chocolate sauce drizzled over. However this would not put me off returning in the future Excellent cakes and super friendly service. Super nice cake   and the coffee   was just amazing Lovely little place, some great desserts and friendly staff. The building is quite small though so you may not be able to get in at busy times,  but it is worth it I had the fudge cake and an orange hot chocolate absolutely delicious, other part members had a roulard which went down very well and sweet crepes also delicious. We were not sold on the savoury crepes, tasted like a sweet mix, so maybe getting savoury from a place called the sweetest thing is not the best move I been going here for the past 4 years. It is a very nice and small place to hangout with friends. Sometimes, it get busy and crowded. Sitting outside in summer is the best feel, especially in the evening, during sunset. People work here are great, great service and lovely people. The prize for the drinks are reasonable. And some drinks taste different to other cafa. I would recommend it anyone. I bring my friends here most of the times. Its in the heart of city. Food for lunch are nice and yummy. They serve well too. Felt to grab a hot chocolate, to help with the cold. Added a slice of chocolate ganache cake as well, double the sweetness. Overall experience was quite good, a warm and cozy inside seating area. I did however find the hot chocolate to be overly sweet though. Nothing better than a lovely coffee in a cozy place with your friends and also some sweets so you must go to The Sweetest Thing. They have my favorite dessert - Banoffee - and much more. Staff are kind,  helpful and also very friendly. Easily the best lemon meringue I have ever had. Not to mention the mind blowing orange-chocolate cake. Incredible little spot The cafe is very small but cosy. I passed many times by car and always wanted to visit. Its very international - youll hear all sort of languages there. The sauce on my carrot cake was tasty and interesting. They also have a bathroom there. I really liked the cafe. Came here with some Austrians who really know their cakes and coffee - they were very impressed with both. #2 on the top 10 places that serve the best hot chocolate in Dublin. Yes, I d say it s well deserving of this ranking. My two kids are dairy intolerant... so, as a place that serves only dairy based drinks, you thot this would be a problem. No, they went the extra mile to make it special for my kids. Thank you, sweetest thing. Popped in for a little sit down and was served possibly the best crepe I ve ever had! The owner was amazing and helpful, even changing some items to fit with my allergies. 100% a hidden gem and well worth a visit if you re in Dublin! Dietary restrictions: Immediately offered menu changes for allergies as soon as I mentioned them. Made it clear it wasn t an issue to change what I needed Can t get better than this !! Yummy !! And the service was amazing with lovely friendly ladies. Highly recommended :))))))) Food The ladies who work here are always so sweet and lovely- they make the dining experience even much more pleasant. Their hot chocolate lattes are absolutely delicious and a must try! Stopped here for a dessert with a friend. I ordered a bayles cheesecake, it was very soft and delicious and not too sweet. My friend was very happy about her chocolate cake too! The fudge cake is amazing!!! I ordered it on recommendation from the girl working and was not disappointed. It came out warm with a side of ice-cream and cream. Super delicious. The cafe is cosy with about 8-10 tables inside and I think 2 outside. I really enjoyed sitting by the window and watching people go by. Loved the   The sweetest thing hot chocolate  from this shop. This cafe is in fact really sweet to look at and have amazing  sweet things . Yummy yummy cakes and the staff is really sweet as well . It is right where we get down from the Dublin coach. So an ideal place to visit for travelers as well. The Sweetest Thing Cafe will offer you some fabulous desserts and cosiness! Divinely delicious! A great little place to relax and enjoy your romantic date. Im in love with this place. Ill certainly come back again! A lovely place, the sweetest thing hot chocolate was amazing ! Thank you to Elaina for her kindness Wow!!! I have tasted hot chocolate in many shops . But I have to admit this is the place which serves the BEST Hot Chocolate. My go to shop for purchase of coffee and cake.... I ve been to the place twice and both times I had a wonderful experience. Coffee is great and the desserts, omg, can t describe how tasty it is. Highly recommended The Sweetest Thing has the sweetest people. They stayed open late to help make a little girl s birthday more special with the best hot chocolate and gluten free brownies. Guiness hot chocolate ? Yes they have. This and much more! Cakes, Irish coffees, with different flavors.. really the place for sweet things! In the center the price is actually nice! Such a lovely place! I would definitely recommend to stop by for some delicious treats. Very good Chocolate fudge cake and pancakes. Give it a try if you are around. Great range of hot chocolates and delicious cakes. A incredible cafe in every way imaginable. Great cake, proper coffee and hot chocolate in several varieties, cozy irish atmosphere. Leaves nothing to be desired. Lovely place, its cozy and the decoration, ambience is really nice. The cakes were heavenly delicious and the coffee was great too The staff are so nice. Great coffee and cake We found some hair in the waffle. We gave it to the waiter and she took the plate and she saw the hair on the plate. We came back to ask for a refund and she told us that we already ate everything and she couldn t refund us and kept making excuses. It s ok for us that we did not get a refund but just an advice:put your hair up to prevent that they fall on the plate. It s also important to present yourself in a good away and also to preserve hygiene Absolutely brilliant cafe. Staff, food, ambiance were excellent Best cakes I ve ever had- truly delicious. They do everything to perfection and the hot chocolate is to die for. Staff are lovely too which helps. Lovely cosy place. Baileys hot chocolate and sausage roll were delicious. Staff very friendly. Amazing hot chocolate. They got lots of varieties. I was overwhelmed so asked the staff about their best one and the two lovely staff girls were quite helpful with their suggestions. Would recommend 10/10. If you are in town, you can t miss them."
193,The Tram Cafe,4.65,"What a hidden gem right across from Jervis Shopping Centre! The whole decor and layout is pretty cool and well designed. Love the relaxing atmosphere, sitting inside a tram while having a coffee transports you into a nice relaxing place. Coffee itself was really good. Flat white was spot on and the scone was nice too. Really good prices too. We had a great time, the setting is super beautiful. The drinks were good as was the carrot cake. Very nice waiter Really liked this place. Rarely review but felt compelled to. Really good food, didn t skimp on portion or quality. Nice sandwiches, pastries, and coffee friendly staff. Only complaint was the thumping techno music which interspersed the jazz the music didn t fit the venue and was slightly interrupted the relaxed lunch and chat vibe Cozy cafe close to Henry street, opposite the jervis car park entrance. As the name suggests, feels like a tram on the outside and inside. Although it might look small, they ve reasonable seating inside and a few tables outside as well. The menu is quite small, but they ve options for vegetarians and vegans. Davorn was friendly and helpful - he recommended the Cajun chicken toasted sandwich - it was filling and delicious. It had the right mix and proportion of ingredients. Chicken was well cooked and it was not overloaded with mayo or cheese. Vegan sausage roll, it was nice, good for an evening snack with a coffee or tea. Staff was friendly and courteous. Prices were reasonable compared to some of the other cafes in and around the city centre. Ate sausage roll & Cajun toasties The toasties were excellent! Service on point, friendly and quick. Atmosphere was really calm with good music, Highly recommended 2 stars for Irish breakfast. Not fresh cooked, more to just reheat those sausages, bacon & etc, everything is dry and doesnt taste good, hope its not from the day before. I would like to support local business but pls show your sincerity. (5 stars for very friendly staffs) For a unique dining experience inside an old tram with original features, this is a favourite with locals and tourists alike.There is an atmospheric outdoor seating area and a secret covered garden with a tree in the middle outside around the back of the tram. Situated in a public square opposite the side of the Jervis Shopping centre, you can relax and get good food and drinks at very reasonable prices. They have a wonderful menu which I have partially photographed and also a glimpse inside the tram, as well as the outside area which has been recently made more beautiful. Very friendly staff and a unique experience, thats what makes dining here a joy. Enjoy the photos! Enjoy the experience! Absolutely loved this place! Very cosy and the food and drinks were amazing - have never had a better granola bowl! Wish I lived in Dublin so I could come more often! This place is so cosy! I come here every day for a coffee on my lunch break at work. The staff are super nice and the food is genuinely really good. The baked goods too. Like; look at this cookie. Look At It! Bask in its glory! *Ahem* So yeah the place is great. You should totally go I was shopping with the wife and I needed a quick caffeine boost. I saw the tram and thought why not. The espresso was served through a hatch . Decent coffee. I ll be back for a sandwich. Vegetarian options: I m sure they are there Dietary restrictions: Clearly listed Parking: There s none Kid-friendliness: There s a massive court for kids to run around Wheelchair accessibility: Yes The Tram Cafe was an unexpected bonus on our visit to St. Patricks Cathedral. Our youngest was shell-shocked at the deliciousness of the gluten free chocolate chip cookie. (Im judgy about the texture of GF goodies more than the taste, and I was equally floored by how amazing it was.) The portion sizes for just one meal (sandwich and crisps) were nearly enough for two of us. The staff members were so inviting that we felt like old friends. As an added bonus, the kids could run around in the park while Mom and Dad took our time enjoying the food and staying under the umbrella, out of the rain. Weve been wanting to go for a while but never had time to stop for a coffee till now. Beautiful old tram converted into a cafe where its worth sitting inside, beautiful interior. We only tried the coffee this time, very tasteful and good service. Cute place ! Flowery n fresh ! Wish they served the pastries warm There are some serious breakfast competitions in Dublin.  But this place definitely is the best! Great service. Comfy seats and fam food! Lovely spot - the team work hard to keep you comfy. The sandwichs are great and the secret garden lovely. The new loo ok the square is a gift. This is real tram, imported, restored, expanded. Its gorgeous in normal times to sit in and theres a rear inside area. In covid times they now have a huge awning that covers many tables and there is a secret covered garden area at the back. Working hard doing lovely stuff. Stopped here before our flight back home. I m so happy we found this place. Inside seating was closed, so we sat in the patio area outside. Weather wasn t too bad so we were okay with that. We watched the birds while we ate. The food and drinks were delicious and the staff was very nice! Definitely recommend! A very cozy and sweet place that I would love to revisit. I tried their hot chocolate and it was great. Hoping to revisit to grab a bite soon. Loved this place! A super cute and quiet spot with the best almond croissants and friendly staff! 10/10 Lovely setting for a coffee, brunch or lunch! A gem of Dublin, you rarely find this European style cafe in the city. The cafe is set in a real old tram, with extended outside seating. Food is simple but tasty, coffee is really good. They do takeaway, but note: no bathroom! Also live has Friday night and Sunday afternoon :) Ancient meets modern. This is the simplest way to describe this little vintage cafe in the heart of Dublin. This place has a beautiful history which can be read by whoever visits this cafe. As the name suggests, this cafe is an old tram that has been modified and so the seats inside are like that of a tram. Seating outside, though is like that of a normal cafe, is beautiful on a sunny day. So in either way it s a beautiful win-win situation, where, either you enjoy the seating inside the tram while soaking up the history or enjoy the pleasant weather outside in the background of the vintage tram. Great little spot in the heart of Dublin! 120 years old tram restored with a lot of history behind serving as a cafe restaurant! Definitely worth of a visit! It is a great place to get a coffee and enjoy a good weather day. There are lots of seagulls and pidgeons, so be careful that they dont steal your meal. Came here on a rainy day and really enjoyed it. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the oat milk cappuccino was great. I took 1 star off because the croissant was good but not great. Overall I would definitely come back to try more. Great cafe with amazing coffee in the heart of Dublin. Reasonably priced and very friendly staff . Highly recommend . Fabulous,  food is amazing,  and the atmosphere is brilliant,  its like stepping back to the 1920s!  Coffee is the best too   and its reasonably priced too!  Hiden gem in the city Great novelty place in the heart of the city. Very accommodating staff. The only minus point is for not having a restroom which was more understandable when the cafe was literally in the tram only and less since it has expanded. I am sure it is to do with the city permissions etc. but I hope it will be possible one day as on a rainy day like today one does not want to have to run to the shopping center across the street. The location and interior are great with fitting music really nice ambiance, definitely a nice place for a coffee date. The coffee is probably not for the coffee lover/connoisseur its a very light/fruity coffee. We had a Guinness cake which to me tastes more like a fruit cake it was nice just not the best. The Tram Cafe in Dublin is quite a unique cafe where it looks like a repurposed tram that got turned into a cafe. In addition to the friendly and efficient staff, we found the coffee from the Tram Cafe to be delicious. It s conveniently located near a Luas station and Henry street too so it s readily accessible. I purchased 2 Americamo to go. I can only describe the contents of the cups as stagnant dish water. Amazing experience, food and staff, thank you Nice place to take a break, have a coffee, and enjoy the weather. Coffee was good and we sat for a while unbothered while we chatted. The best coffee in town. The staff is extremely friendly and professional. Any recommendation definitely. Excellent experience, took me too long to go there, but I will return soon. I loved everything. <3 Wonderful use of an old tram car, fun for any train enthusiast! Friendly staff and delicious veggie sausage rolls. Such a cute ambiance and delicious coffee! Coffee was so good, atmosphere is so nice and calming Nice cafe located in heart of Dublin city Friendly staff... had lovely breakfast here. Thanks Food : 5/5 The Cajun Chicken sandwich was class. Unfortunately they didn t have vegetarian food at the time but the waiter was very nice about it and gave us some pastries on the house. Would come again, nice to sit outside Absolutely amazing. Stopped here as my first official meal in Ireland and was nowhere near dissapointed. Adorable ideal of using an old street car as a restaurant. I also have no idea how they are turning out these great meals in such a small place. I got their spup of the day which was a Pumkin, mushroom and coconut milk soup. I was a little hesitant but it was probably the best use of pumpkin since the pumpkin pie.  Great Job guys. For all people interested in visiting Dublin this to me is a must. Love this place because of the atmosphere. Very unique. Still a bit angry that they reduced their menu (especially savoury crepes which were my favourites). But still good food. Hoping for the crepes to make a comeback one day. Wheelchair accessibility: Not that great for wheelchairs or strollers"
194,The Umbrellas Dublin,3.5,"Not really anything special to see here.  Don t go out of way / waste time trying to find it.  If you close spend maybe 30 sec to do a photo or just borrow mine / someone else s. Otherwise solid nopes. Very cool s spot in an alley!  Some cool shops along the way in this hidden spot. Worth a stop. Very cool to see! Be advised they are located in a true service road / alley and had several trucks parked underneath both times we went by. Unintentionally passed by this lovely alley with colorful umbrellas hung in the air. No need to visit deliberately but if you pass by it s also a good place to take cute photos. Big scam there are almost no umbrellas and the street is not necessarily pretty But the perpendicular streets are quite nice with a lot of shops Cool but underwhelming.  We thought it would be much longer, but were surprised at how short it was. Basically a couple minute stop Severely underwhelmed. Good for a photo but nothing else. Wouldn t bother going out of your way to see It is good, nothing very special though Big, fat meh. There arent that many umbrellas, and theres nothing else interesting in this alley related to the umbrellas or really worth seeing. If youre here and the weather is nice or you do Instagram, sure, check it out. Otherwise, dont bother. Nice image. Interesting but being done in most cities now. Still worth a couple of pictures. Very Instagramable??? It s a rather disappointing experience. It s in a small blocked alley, near the dumpsters of some Chinese restaurants, so it s a dirty, smelly experience. It s even dark and gloomy on a sunny day. Very pretty. It is a recommended visit if you are in Dublin, because it is a colorful street and you can take a beautiful photo If you are lucky, you will see the umbrellas :) Came several times before when half of them were either broken or missing...this is a rather dodgy street, so looks nice only with a good weather surprisingly their was no one their on a Saturday good for a quick photo. The most unusual place to visit Super small part of the street, looks much bigger online. But cute idea Cute place to get a picture. Close to shipping and some yummy food. Pases by here but probably one of the not so prettiest umbrellas spots you ll ever see. It s in a back alley and has no photo appeal. Definitely don t recommend if your walking long distances to see this, just not worth it. (Didn t even take a picture at the end). Nothing exceptional, to do if you pass nearby but we are far from the pink street of Lisbon for example. Some umbrellas across the street in nice colours - that s about it! Nothing special. Could take a peek if it s along the way for you. But not worth a dedicated trip. Not really something to see it nice place for the insta picture, best when sunny Probably the most photographed location in Dublin but dont let that stop you from coming here and getting a picture for yourself Its by the bins... Avoid. Visited on Like the fun and creativity of this place...making the best of a slightly out of the way destination Very beautiful, i should have come in daylight. Lovely A picturesque spot to take that perfect insta photo of your travels. Nice photo spot Wonderful!! Love it!! Cute and easy to find Nice place Great expectations and fake reality Very beautiful attraction! A secret tip Treat for the eyes !! Must visit Underwhelming I expected something better Ok-ish"
195,The Wishing Hand,4.075,"The wishing hand - in the Department of Education yard, so make sure you go during the day! The grounds are nice, there is a security guard as well. A block from the main street! A good photo op! We had overcast weather and not much light, but this is Ireland for you! Birds soil the hand but it wasnt bad, one can still fit in for the picture! A 5 min detour and a good one to peek at! The security guard there was amazing and even took the picture for me. Definitely a sight you have to stop by and see and make a wish. The Wishing Hand - Try making a wish at the Wishing hand. Free to look at! Make a wish if you wish Not much here other than a hand, you cant even sit on the grass without being moved along. Quick photo and move along. The church across the road is much better Unfortunately it was closed so couldnt go near it, but got photos I work near this for the last 15 years. Known as a helping hand in education. It was cool, I know, we get tempted to take pics and I did it XD. You can fit in the hand! Very attractive but couldn t enter because it was closed.i enjoyed it from the outside. kids go to school here Interesting, worth to go there and see Good Beautiful spot. The Wishing Hand steht im nordlichen Teil der Innenstadt von Dublin auf dem Vorplatz einen Ministeriums in der Malborough Street. Die uberdimensionale Hand wurde aus Bronze gestaltet. Ob die Hand etwas anbietet, oder etwas haben mochte, kann man nicht erkennen. Auf dem sehr gepflegten Platz ist sie auf jeden Fall mit den sehenswerten Gebauden im Hintergrund ein gelungenes Fotomotiv. Usaidtear an ait chun scith a ligean agus greimin bia a ithe so bheadh se ina chabhair bosca bruscair a chur ann. Nice photo motif, but unfortunately it was not clear what the artist wanted to tell us with his work. Can you wish for something here, or does the hand wish/expect something? We took photos in the pouring rain, but then quickly moved on.

196,The Wooden Whisk,4.375,"Had the most delicious breakfast here. Both the Irish breakfast & smoked salmon eggs Benedict were delightful and delicious. You order at the counter and they bring you your food, they also had a great and yummy looking selection of pastries and desserts. An Irish breakfast and a plate of avocado, ricotta toast and soft-boiled eggs, squeezed orange juice and tea for 32 euros. The dishes are copious and the quality is there. In terms of service, there are a lot of people so a little waiting, the servers are pleasant and attentive. The atmosphere is good, an open kitchen (be careful, you will come out with your clothes soaked in the fumes from the kitchen) which allows you to see the cook working. Neat. We had the mini Irish breakfast and the avocado poached eggs. The Irish breakfast was definitely worth the price, the avocado poached eggs were tast but a bit on the expensive side for the quantity. Overall, a good place for breakfast. Excellent little place for breakfast. The portions are big and food tastes nice. A must visit for breakfast lovers. Breakfast was amazing.  The French Toast with Irish Bacon tasted so good, and the coffee was wonderful.  Service was fast, friendly and efficient.  The staff was very patient with our questions. Ambiance was charming.  Seating was casual and comfortable. Prices were reasonable. I was a little disappointed, as while the Brioche French toast with the thick syrup was very good, one of the two was mushy in the middle from being undercooked, and the scrambled eggs and bacon were a little overcooked. (I should have ordered the eggs fried as another guest had them and they looked good). The staff was nice and service was good. However I got a Biscoff muffin to go, and it was very good!  Maybe we went on an off day? Dont let my review keep you from trying it, perhaps. I searched for a breakfast spot close to my hotel and found Wooden Whisk. I chose it because of the high quantity and quality reviews.  After ordering, I realized that if this restaurant had such stellar reviews, then my chances of getting really good food in Dublin wouldnt be likely. The gentleman on the register wasnt friendly or helpful. That was a bit  turnoff, but I was starving and just wanted food. The food was not terrible or great, mediocre at best. The restaurant was clean and in a centralized area. Would I return? Probably not. I have been meaning to visit this cafe for a long time now, finally was near spire and made an impromptu decision to go. Very cute little cafe almost hidden away, 3min from the spire They had the most delicious looking pastries on display. We got waffles, coffee and cake. Waffles felt a bit dry, coffee was amazing and the cake/pastry was fresh and fantastic. Not sure what I got but I think it was Italian? Only sad thing is they don t serve matcha latte and you have to order and pay at the counter. Menu has lots of options, Loved the place and will come back Absolutely fabulous cafe, great food and prices! Atmosphere is excellent whole interior decor is clean and neutral! Staff our wonderful! Highly recommend! Now this place is quite a find. Absolutely beautiful food, so fresh and tasty. Probably the finest wrap and soup Ive ever had. Beautiful coffee and the pastries.... well...see for yourself. This is a place to visit and bring anyone you want to impress... excellent Delicious! They have such a wide variety of tartlets, cakes, and lots of other sweets. The fruit tart was amazing. Their brunch menu is also incredible, they have eggs cooked different ways, wraps, pancakes. We really enjoyed everything we tried. Fast and good. Well made cappuccino with nice service. The avocado toast with poached eggs and as made artfully and tasted great. I would ask for light parmigiana cheese. The eggs were runny and well poached. I added a side of crispy bacon Alright food. Nice atmosphere. Service was fine. Picked this place as an alternative over Starbucks and very pleased we did - far better for a quick bite. The atmosphere is good but nothing exceptional, but the food and the service were extraordinary, they made my start the day in the best way. Recommended The food was very delicious and the wait time wasn t long at all. Everyone there was very friendly. Yum! Would be 4.5 stars but cant do that. What lets it down is the Full irish as it  only comes with 1 piece of small thin bread. Either get better bread or plate two pieces. French toast was incredible though All was delicious Great place to have breakfast and terrific cappuccino! A bit to much butter on the toast and eggs, but very nice. Maybe they can make small portions so that people who cannot eat much (e.g. due to gastric bypass) can eat as well and leave a empty plate instead of half a plate. We tried breakfast here while visiting Dublin. My mom had the  eggs Benedict and I had toast and bacon with a side of eggs plus an almond milk latte. We went when they first opened so it wasn t crowded and we enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. The food was good and the servers were welcoming and attentive. The only thing I didn t like was that they were baskets filled with silverware laying on the table and everyone help themselves. Since we were the first people of the day, it was OK, but with Covid it didn t feel the most safe if you were to be eating later in the day. Otherwise, it was a great stop in our journey, and I would recommend! So glad I popped in here! Was early for an appointment so went on the look for a coffee shop and almost walked passed this little gem, lovely comfortable well lit, lovely coffee and the nicest scrambled egg! 15 euro for one of the most sub standard cooked breakfasts Ive had in Dublin. Cold toast, cold plate, tiny puddings, burnt eggs and a large helping of disappointment. Friendly service though Amazing food, really quick service and friendly staff. Place looked lovely and was really clean we will definitely be back! We ordered The Wooden Whisk s big Irish breakfast for through their Deliveroo partners. Both The Wooden Whisk and the Deliveroo cyclist at the time were very quick to bring the food to our place. We thought the Irish breakfast options were very generous. More importantly, we were happy about the fact that the Irish breakfast was neither excessively greasy nor salty. Other places don t get it right but The Wooden Whisk were spot on. The hash browns, beans, eggs, tomatoes, bread, black pudding, tomatoes, bacon and sausages were all delicious. The side salad with the piquant dressing was also appreciated and something I wouldn t normally have with a plate of Irish Breakfast but it worked really well with the more  traditional  components of an Irish Breakfast. Their Oreo Cheesecake was glorious too! We enjoyed the food from The Wooden Whisk in Dublin and we ll definitely order from them again. The girl in the service was extremely lovely. Very nice service, appreciate the effort, it must have come from her heart, personality, being so nice on the bank holiday Sunday before closing. Cakes. The aesthetics are a good.  I bought one, which is a Napoleon cake clone, but so far from it, its difficult to describe...The other one is a rum- choco cake, but the sweetener/ sugar/black strap is so overpowering the cake looses its identity. Not good. Period. Someone who never had these kind of cakes might think they are very nice, but honestly these were below average. For  5.5 its a joke. However, as its a very busy street, with lots of tourists I wish all the best for the shop! Atmosphere is unfortunate as the shop is on Talbot Street. Anyhow, thanks for the nice server girl. We had a great breakfast here. My eggs Benedict were very good, on fresh brioche bread and very good bacon. Friendly staff. Unpretentious interior. Whenever I am in the city center I always drop into the Wooden Whisk for a coffee and a slice of their delicious Black Forest Gateau  .  The cafe has an extensive brunch, lunch and dinner menu and it is truly a jewel on Talbot Street. The irish breakfast is phenomenal and the iced coffee was so good. It wasnt overly sweet, yet was as easy to drink as chocolate milk. The orange juice was freshed squeezed and very refreshing. Ill struggle to want to go anywhere else for breakfast. Veggie breakfast & iced americano were great! Staff were friendly and was a nice atmosphere. Not too expensive but not cheap either. The perfect place for a cozy and tasty breakfast!! Must visit and taste! Also really nice fresh sweets After seeing the photos of the French toast here, with a very thick brioche bread, I decided to try it and the reality was completely different. The brioche tastes good although it is not at all similar to the thick slice of the pics, it is more like a 4th part of that which I later thanked because they only have golden syrup which, personally, is horrible and not even close to the flavour and lightness of the real maple syrup (strange thing that they put  maple syrup  on the menu and not golden syrup). I finally had to eat my plain dry-ish french toast. I expected more and I was disappointed, another person may like it tho! Try it yourselves Went at about 9am and got great service. Got the Full Fry Up (full Irish breakfast) which was a treat.  Enough food for 2 to share. The owner was very kind and gave us extra fruits free of charge. Cappuccino was great!  Well priced.  Would go back. Vegetarian options: Vegetarian breakfast available Kid-friendliness: Booster seat for kids The pastries and the desserts were good. Ordered cakes from here a couple of times and no disappointments there. Came here for a brunch today and everything were a disappointment for our Indian tastebuds. Felt severe lack of seasoning in almost all of our food, the bread was hard in the sandwich and the savoury pastry I got, well left it without eating. Would not come back, atleast for food but for desserts yes :) Lovely place, my friend and I got French toast and Chicken Caesar salad and it was delicious! The girl and the boy that served us were really nice and helpful! Not much to chose from on the menu. The food wasn t good, we couldn t eat it. Left starving. Tasteless beans, sent my  toast  back because it was not toasted & when it returned was no better. Also nobody wants spinach and balsamic with breakfast, is that a dumb idea to try & justify the high prices? I don t know. Had a refund on the food, staff okay though and place clean. Food was good! The poached eggs were a teeny bit over cooked and the bread was slightly under toasted, but everything was really tasty! girl with the cute nails was so kind and the food is amazing. wanted to try a bunch of spots in dublin because we are only here for 3 days but we came here twice cuz first time was so good. bacon: to die for; french toast: exquisite; banana bread was questionable tbh but the hot sauce was awesome on my eggs I was once here for some breakfast on a sunny morning in Dublin. I ordered french toast and cappuccino with almond milk. The lady who made my cappuccino put regular milk instead of almond milk. She politely called my attention, before making my first sip of it,  saying I have the wrong milk in my coffee and got confused about orders. She apologised and changed my coffee. She was very nice. The French Toast - 2 massive slices of brioche. lightly crisp on the outer layer and soft in the inside (just how I like it). In every bite, the texture and flavour combination gets playful in your mouth. It comes with bacon slices, strawberries and orange slices, plus maple syrup on the side. The entire serving is drizzled with powder sugar. If you like sweet and savoury french toast, this is where you should go. The place also offers loads of desserts, cakes, and pastries. This is obviously where local hotels and hostels all point their guests towards and all i can think its because they have a deal set up because it was really not great. Mediocre on a lot of levels and filled with backpackers lmaooooo. Service was quite good though, everyone working there was incredibly nice. 5* service!! My daughter took me out for breakfast and everything was amazing ! Delicious food and fantastic service ! Bogdan our waiter was a dream to deal with! Thank you for a wonderful experience food and service! Probably the best breakfast I ever had in Dublin.Also  the avocado poached egg was amazing as my daughter tells me. Everything was fresh and tasty, friendly staff.Just to not forget Americano coffee was the best! Very good breakfast. Friendly staff."
197,These Hands Coffee,4.6,"Popped in for a quick pit stop on a city break. Coffee was okay, not stand out. Pastries also nice, but not amazing. Good central location, staff were polite. I was visiting Dublin for just a few days, and ended up stopping in every day :) The baristas are lovely people! The coffee is tasty and reasonably priced. And they are connected to the The Well next-door which has lots of food options and alcohol. Located beside The Well Bar & Restaurant, Stephen s Green. I ordered oat flat white, regular cappuccino and latte. All three were tops   they serve Imbebe beans, lovely coffee! The barista named Robert was exceptional, he was very welcoming & friendly. He was very enthusiastic with coffee in general, and he certainly loves what he does. Great vibes, even greater coffee  Recommend 10/10. I went there on March 23rd 2024 around 5pm and ordered a latte, dont know the baristas name, but it was the worst coffee Ive had in the 4 years Ive living in Dublin. I guess the reviews are all from friends or something, not from real customers. The pastries are way better than the coffee. Great coffee undeniably. I just felt it s a bit expensive than other places. But will I go again, yesssss!! Food : 4/5 A gem in the heart of Grafton street, just opposite Stephens Green. I had an oat flat white (amazing art and texture) served by friendly staff who greeted me straight away and asked how my day was going. The shop offers a cool laidback vibe, will definitely be a regular! A lovely little cafe just across the road from the main gates of Stephens Green. I had my little dog with me and it was no problem to bring him inside while I ordered. Staff were so friendly and even made a puppuccino specially for Jimmy. I got a a latte which was delicious! Well definitely be back!! Great coffee and really friendly employees. One of the best chai lattes we ve had in the UK and a perfect flat white. The little filled donuts were awesome, too. Number 1 coffee for flavour, texture and quality in Dublin by far!! The service was okay and the flapjack was wonderful and yes to eat it used these hands!! What nice glasses they have. The first time I tried the coffee here I didnt like it very much, it was ok but not the best. But I decided to give it a second and third chance and I did well to make this choice (it probably depends on who prepares it) . Last time I really liked it, plus the place is very nice and very well arranged. The barista (the boy) was very nice and took the order quickly and prepared it very quickly. Coffee was mediocre and the staff member did not speak a single word to me through our entire interaction. No acknowledgement of my order, didnt tell me the price, just pointed the machine at me and no enjoy, thank you, goodbye. Nothing. Was a brief and unpleasant experience Lovely smooth cappuccino, well above average, and nice selection of pastries etc. Dark chocolate brownie comes recommended. Top service too. Best if you plan takeaway or sitting outside Very creepy staff member Zuko made inappropriate comments and behaviour. Unnacceptable and horrible. Management said they could do nothing to regulate staff members behaviour - disgraceful Small coffee shop with a laidback vibe. Cappuccino was very tasty. Not sure what beans they use but it had a bold, distinct flavour. Cakes look tempting (homemade?) but we were too full to try. Limited indoor and outdoor seating but you can just grab something to go and head over to St Stephen s if there s no available spots. Excellent coffee beans and we have sampled many coffees in the US and Scandinavia. Really good coffee, roasted by imbibe. Friendly folks and delicious snacks. Had a double espresso of washed bean (I forget which at moment) and a delicious apple and peanut butter biscuit. Iced latte is so good Slightly bitter ( as per my taste buds)taste off the coffee. Salted caramel delicious But worth a visit Oat milk latte and coffee were delicious and the service was quite great, very welcoming folks. They know their coffee well. Very nice coffee. Great service. The coffee is absolutely delicious and the staff super nice. Definitely a great place to enjoy a coffee Their coffee is amazing, one of my fav places The best coffee in Dublin so far I live in Australia and appreciate great coffee! I wanted to write a review about my daily pilgrimage to this great place every day I was there in Dublin last year before the world changed. I hate to cast a slur on my previous attempts to get this standard of coffee in Dublin but let s say I had to convert to tea while I was there. I think the coffee from These Hands is equivalent to the best cup from a top barista in Melbourne. I think Dublin is the most wonderful city in the world and now it s got coffee to match! Very lovely staff that still helped us whilst closing! The coffees they served were really good as well! Third wave coffee shop with great energy. Our barista, Rob, was friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming. He recommended some beans as well as other coffee shops to check out, and he was right on the mark with both. Will be back! Not pricy, yet very delicious! Order: Latte Temperature: asked for extra hot, got extra hot Milk/Coffee Ratio: nice balance Aroma: smooth Roaster: unknown Size/Price ratio: 3.40 for normal size Latte (12oz), 3.10 for Flat White (8oz) Facilities: Small coffee place, nearly hidden by the Well next to it, only found it as i was looking for a coffee place on Google Maps! But apparently they have been there for nearly 2 yrs! Service: Friendly Covid measures: Plexi screen, masks Opinion: Nice coffee Cool coffee shop in Dublin to check out if youre in the area! The atmosphere is chill and welcoming. Capuccino was delicious, as was the the pistachio croissant. The owner is very cordial and the place is dog friendly. The coffee shop is inside the well, NOT inside the shopping mall. Overall Id definetly come back even just for the pastry. Great espresso, lovely staff. Hidden gem in town Consistently been getting fantastic coffee from here. The staff are fabulously friendly and brighten your day every time. Cannot recommend this place enough My favourite coffee shop in Dublin. Always a good vibe and welcoming atmosphere. The coffee never fails to impress. Perfect place to grab a coffee and head to the park. The coffee is delicious and well made (so the good ratings of the place ar true :) If you like coffee you cannot do much wrong with this place. (Ps: I also like the simple design of the logo and place) Incredibly lovely staff, took the time to chat and make us feel welcome. amazing coffee (and drinks/food) !!! if you have time to go, definitely do! Absolute treasure. Small space, but some of the best bakery in the city. Owner is friendly and welcoming. Make a point to visit, its well worth it. The best caffe in Dublin. The staff alwaysa amazing Amazing place to get coffee, tastes great, staff is friendly, fair prices! Love the iced coffee! Super friendly staff and delicious coffee too! Best flatwhite in Ireland (based on 20 flat whites from around the country) will definitely be back, next time we are here! Vegetarian options: Oat Flat White"
198,Third Space Smithfield,4.4,"This is a very nice cafe and 5 min walk from Luas. They also have a public speaking and Board games event on Monday and Thursday evening. I like this place and ambience is amazing. Their food and coffee is also nice and i recommend to visit the cafe Great place for lunch! Friendly atmosphere, quick service, and decent prices. The Cajun chicken ciabatta is amazing and has a great kick to it. The avocado toast was also stellar. There is plenty of seating inside or out. We went at peak lunch hour and didn t need to wait to find a table. Will definitely make this a regular spot during my work day. Vegetarian options: Veggie rolls, porridge, veggie wrap Delicious Irish breakfast! Coffee & chai latte were also very good. Service was a little slow but it was very busy due to the Bank Holiday weekend. Would be nice if cutlery was brought to table with food/already on the table :) We had a great time, the porridge was delicious and the atmosphere was authentic. The staff was very friendly and accommodating This place is fantastic. The food is tasty and always comes out freshly-cooked/hot. The staff members are really friendly. There are books to read or you can exchange them with one you have yourself. There s an area where you re encouraged to speak with strangers too! I m not from Dublin so don t go very often but I ll definitely be going back there every time I m there. We loved it! During our stay in Dublin, we had breakfast twice at the Third Space and everything we tried was delicious! We loved trying out some typical Irish breakfast and they have a vegetarian and vegan option, which is amazing, because we struggled to find some delicious and affordable vegetarian food in Dublin. The super porridge was amazing and the portion was huge!!! We can definitely recommend it:) We decided to check out this eatery after seeing some sandwiches being served at a table outside caught our attention. All quite pleasant; the restaurant operates on a sort of self-service basis for ordering, cutlery, and water, but waitstaff takes care of the rest. Both of the dishes we ordered with orange juice were tasty, and the pricing was fair as well. Really disappointing. Have to order at the til. No knives when we ordered. No glasses at the water jug. Food took 30 minutes to come. Tea was served when we ordered  the food so was obviously cold when the food arrived. Eggs overcooked. No sauces at the table. So many small improvements could go a long way I ate here twice for breakfast during my stay in Dublin. Super friendly staff with quick and efficient service. Everything I tried was tasty. Loved the atmosphere and the food was splendid too. Full Irish Breakfast was awesome. A wonderful cafe with indoor, terrace, outdoor and an interior library. I had a turkey and stuffing toasted sandwich and a coffee, my friend had a tea and mince pie. A lovely spot. Food Casual friendly lunch with the delight of a full Irish plus pot of tea served till a very civilised 2pm. The pastrami sandwich was heavenly. Top notch lunch. Vegetarian options: Good selection of veggie and vegan offerings We loved the ambiance and style of the cafe. We ordered two coffees with soya milk and the vegan breakfast platter. Although we appreciate it being called vegan and having a vegan option, the platter itself it is not vegan. It is served with eggs and butter for the toast. We were guests at the Hendrick hotel and the employee informed us that we get 10% off at the cafe because we were staying there which was very nice of her. Overall, a good experience at this cafe. Great Spot, lovely place, helpful & friendly staff, fantastic food. Stopped here with my family for a breakfast to get the busy day of sight seeing started, and it didnt disappoint Food Simple but very satisfying Full Irish breakfast. Prices were reasonable, friendly staff, welcome to locals and travellers alike. Would definitely go again. Excellent cafe serving great breakfast, pastries, and lunch. Mini Irish breakfast and full Irish breakfast available for reasonable price. Community book area inside to read on a rainy day and outdoor seating also available. Great place to spend some time enjoying a coffee and relaxing. This place was super close to our hotel and advertised an Irish breakfast until I think 2 pm so we decided to stop by. The Irish breakfast was great!! It s a cute little place with delicious looking pastries and overall good food!! No complaints. Cosy restaurant, you can discute, read, eat or everything at the same time. We feel good here. Thanks for this moment ! We ordered weekend full Irish, cappuccino and fresh orange juice. Overall it was really good, well prepared but Hash brown was in particular super fresh, orange juice is really tasty and healthy. Staff are smiley, friendly and really welcomy. I was wrong about this place before that it doesn t look nice. It s actually the best Irish breakfast on Smithfield Square. Definitely will be back for brunch again. Great place if you love a full Irish 10/10 girlfriend had Avocado toast which she thought was amazing too. Staff were really nice too so I ll definitely be back soon! Treat yourself to the Full Irish. Super breakfast to start the Day. Great service friendly staff great location on the square. One if my favorite places to eat or have a coffee when in town. Food Breakfast- lovely atmosphere and staff/service Full Irish is on the expensive side with no tea/coffee included. The travesty here is the chilli on the full Irish, who does that? Does it count as a full Irish with chilli on it? Also, too much white pepper in the sausages. I would come again but not for the full Mexican breakfast. We ordered a vegetarian breakfast and it was terrible. Like for almost  13 it had cheapy toast, dry sausages and mushrooms. Really little effort gone into it at all. Wouldnt recommend! Vegetarian options: What we got wasnt great. Been to this place a few times and love it have had the full Irish and the scrambled eggs with the bacon in it delish!!!!! Staff are super friendly and the kids love their hot choccies! I got the mini Irish, the hubs got the full Irish, and the kiddo got the porridge. We all loved our food and the service was fast and very friendly! The atmosphere was very welcoming and comfortable. Beautiful cafe, with loads of books to read if you want. I ve only had breakfast here - it was very nice. Worth a visit. Needs a good clean and new furniture. Windows also dirty. I really liked the canteen/self-service aspect. The staff is very welcoming, people are very relaxed, a good breakfast! One of my favourite cafes around the area for a breakfast roll and just to sit on in general the staff is so friendly and welcoming would 100% recommend to anybody Awesome. A great place for a coffee or breakfast. We have adored. The raspberry scone with butter and raspberry jam was killer and the coffee is very good (surprising across the Channel :)). An excellent Irish breakfast at a very reasonable price. A very warm welcome and nice decor.... Not for profit cafe and bookshop. We went for a full Irish breakfast costing about  8 which was nicely prepared and tasty. Service was good and staff were friendly. Makes a change to visit here instead of a multinational chain. Took Flat white, latte, scone and veggie pub...place is really good. Need to visit again to try Irish Breakfast (seems good) Fantastic neighbourhood cafe. Very fast service and good for quick bites. I wish they opened on Sunday mornings though. I cant wait to try more of their menu. Visited for breakfast.. Service was great. Breakfast was lovely.. Plenty of it too and great value.. Love the food, but a pity that service takes so long, lost half of my lunch hour today waiting for an already made wrap to be toasted... Gotta say the taste was different in an interesting way but good , mashed avocado with vinegar taste (but sour ) and spice sauce. Coffee was good as well ! Good ambience, lovely flat white coffee and a nice Irish Breakfast available in mini form. Well placed for Smithfield Luas tram stop The avo on toast was tasty  . The first coffee weve had was a bit bitter, but the second one was good and well extracted Third Spaces often refer to spaces that are not work or home. Places where communities are built. We came to this place as tourists from America on our last day in Dublin. I wish I could be part of the community this place is fostering long term. The staff here are amazing. The service and food are incredible. They showed us incredible kindness and grace after an accident we had shortly after starting our meal. I ate the mini Irish and a latte. Both excellent and the right proportion and recommend both. I can t wait to come back next time I m in Dublin."

200,Tourist Office Dublin,3.7096774193548385,"Its not the real tourist office. Its an office which sells tours thats why they are not really good about information. The real one is perfect and is situated near Dublin Castle. We were there twice to find out. We came across the first person who neither greeted us nor smiled, but rather gave us huffs and very shaky advice. Sir, why do you work at the Dublin tourist office if you dont like tourists? After this useless exchange, we went back and found a smiling, polite person who gave us extremely good advice! We thank her for this advice! When we ask what there is to do in Dublin for a day we come across a French woman who explains to us that apart from the bus tour which costs  30 there is nothing to do, I find it a shame to only talk about what is for sale in the Office. We thought we would have at least a walking route or that we would be recommended a museum to visit. We booked a tour to Moher cliffs and Galway...everything was amazing and Finn best coach driver ever!!!! See you next time, thankssssss!!! Very disappointed with the information on the sightseeing buss. I buy my 3 tickets on Thursday at 1 p.m. from a French seller so no communication problem between us. I ask when the 24 hour validity of the tickets starts and she replies  when you first board the bus, the QR code on the ticket is scanned and your 24 hour hop on hop off period starts . The next day, Friday, at 11 a.m. we start our first ride on the bus. The driver doesnt scan anything and just looks at the tickets. Later we have lunch and around 2 p.m. we take the bus again. We then see on the ticket that the validity period ended on Friday at 1 p.m.!!! So, either the saleswoman (student coming from Toulouse for the summer) is incompetent or she lied. But  28 per person for 2 hours of service provided is completely overpriced. Prefer city buses with a travel guide, cheaper and just as effective. We bought a bus ticket to the airport, the representative give us the wrong address (its not not infront of the castle (we were with baggage) - its half km away!!!!), did not give us the bus number, ans said the the station is visible (lilttle sign, we almost missed him) Don t trust the opening times! We arrived at 5:45 pm and everyone had already left and the cleaning lady sent us away. We traveled half an hour to the office to book a tour we were gonna do that evening. Very annoying! The staff were friendly though the next day Great that you can leave your luggage here whilst your your the city; however they closed the shop whilst they had a meeting and you could not collect your bags! It was only after a crowd gathered that someone came out. Very good advice for excursions and saving time to avoid the queue to purchase tickets from the Trinity College library. To recommend Good advice. We were given a map and recommended places to visit in Dublin Friendly staff but I dont consider this a tourist Office. They are onlly selling tours. (we did however get a free map of the city) They recommended many activities to do in Dublin Guy from the office provided me requested information and was helpful. I left the baggage here for 7 , but the downside is that they have open office only by 5pm. Got a map of the city there! Staff was very helpful and nice. Very good Great service and information Preso un tour con una delle compagnie con cui collaborano ci siamo presentati allorario stabilito in un posto pieno di altri tour. Nel casino generale il guidatore non si e presentato o se si e presentato non si e preoccupato di 6 persone paganti. Risultato tour perso, soldi persi ed inutile sveglia allalba. Chieste spiegazioni ci dicono di essere nella ragione. Sconsigliato Nettes Personal und ausreichend Flyer fur samtliche Fuhrungen und Veranstaltungen in und um Dublin. Empfehlenswert ist die Stadtkarte von Dublin selbst. Lediglich die schiere Masse an Flyer konnte einen erschlagen. Ein System in Rubriken ware schon. Wir hatten eine Frage zu den Busverbindungen zum Flughafen und diese konnte uns nicht wirklich beantwortet werden bzw. wurden wir an die falsche Adresse geschickt!! Wozu arbeitet man in einem Tourist Office, wenn man von solch einfachen Sachen keine Ahnung hat ?!? Ufficio turistico situato appena fuori il Trinity ed in pieno centro, dove e possibile prenotare ogni tipo di escursione ed avere informazioni sulla citta!! Muy buena atencion. Y en espanol. Gracias a Esther por sus consejos y amabilidad Cortesi e precisi nel dare  informazioni nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan"
201,Touristy Private Guided Tours of Ireland,5.0,"We had an amazing day with Miriam. Our tour was Newgrange and she treated my eleven year old son and myself like family. Miriam is extraordinarily professional, she reached out the day before the tour to set up the pick up, arrived five minutes early, gave us the lay of the land at Newgrange and connected with the ticket counter to know when we would be done there. It was a lovely day exploring a beautiful part of Ireland. She anticipated our very need and even added a sweet treat stop for my son (his favorite part of the day). My favorite part of the day was hearing from Miriam about Ireland while observing the fabulous scenery that Ireland has to offer! Miriam made several recommendation about what else to do in Ireland and we took them all! She even dropped us off at one of the locations to help us maximize our day. I highly recommend this tour company ! Noel was so patient while we waited to disembark from our cruise ship, delayed by fog. He managed to get us to all the places we had planned in a slightly abbreviated tour. He is knowledgeable,  pleasant, and funny. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with him! Wonderful experience!   Miriam was so professional and contacted us the night before.  She worked with our schedule and    was so knowledgeable on the places we visited at Newgrange and Hill of Tara.    Even had us stop at few places we didn t know about that were on the way back.  Highly recommend this tour company! We had a lovely day exploring Newgrange and the Hill of Slaine with Noel yesterday. Highly recommend! Noel and Touristy were a pleasure to work with. Especially enjoyed touring the monastery ruins at the Hill of Slain, we had the place all to ourselves. We had a great time on our private tour!  Noel was very knowledgeable and we had the perfect amount of time at each stop.  The flexibility was great, and each site was amazing! Noel was a fantastic guide for our tour of Dublin. He took the time to keep us out of the tourist traps to get a real feel of Dublin. Thanks Noel. The hubby and I spent a magical day with Miriam today.  We visited Knowth, New Grange, Slaine Castle, and Hill of Slaine.  From insider info on the varieties of Irish potatoes to the in s and out s of Dublin traffic - we learned so much in our time together.  The day was perfection . Miriam even brought the sunshine with her. Many thanks Miriam - until we meet again. Theres a reason this tour guide service has only five-star reviews: theyre amazing. Noel was our guide and he made sure we had an absolutely wonderful time seeing Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, and other extremely unique and cool spots off the beaten path.  There were a large number of complications in arranging this tour, all on my end, and Bradley was incredibly patient and kind from beginning to end. A first class operation and well be sure to use their services when we return to Ireland. I highly recommend this tour to see all the best of Ireland! Our guide Noel was absolutely amazing. A genuinely nice guy with lots of knowledge about the beautiful history of Ireland. Noel  gave us tons of information and insights about all our top stops. We prepaid for all our tickets so that each stop was easy & quick. We were able to see everything we wanted with our kids which is no easy task. He was great with our kids! Thank you Noel for making our trip to Dublin so special! Miriam was an exceptional driver and tour guide during our visit to Knowth and Newgrange. She shared her knowledge of the surrounding area and gave us valuable tips for maximizing our experience. She also took us to other interesting sights such as Slane Castle and Slane Abbey and gave us a local s insight to these awe-inspiring attractions. She treated us like family, and by the end of our tour we were eager to come back for another visit. When we do, we ll be sure to connect with Miriam again for our next adventure! We had a great experience with Noel exploring Dublin.  Even though the weather did not cooperate,  Noel helped us make the best of it and we adjusted our sightseeing to inside activities and car tours.  He was very prompt with texting and returning for pick-up to go to our next destination.   All of his recommendations were very helpful and he even took the time to walk us into a pub for lunch and acquire our table for us.  We ran a little later then planned, but that was because he accommodated our daughters last minute request to see Dublin Castle.  All in all, it was a good day and we would definitely hire Noel again. Miriam was terrific! She reached out the day before to confirm the tour. Picked us up the next day, great driver and packed in as much as we could see in a day. I cannot say enough nice things about her. Thank you, Miriam, for making our time a special one! Miriam was a lovely host!  I had one teenager and two sons in their early 20s and they all so enjoyed her tour and company!  She was so easy to talk to and very accommodating. Please tell her you want ice cream from Storm in a Tea Cup!  It was amazing!! Noel was an amazing guide. Gave some great insight into the Newgrange site and then also took some side trips to other pertinent sites in the area to make it an exceptional day. Very much appreciated the humor, atmosphere and pizza recommendations as well. Wonderful trip! Touristy is incredible. They worked with us on a tour package that fit our schedule and budget, pairing us with one of their experienced guides, Noel. He helped us navigate a comprehensive and complicated agenda in the city, as well as the western portion of Ireland. Full and unreserved recommendation of Touristy and staff! We had an amazing private touring experience with Touristy! Our tour guide for Bru na Boinne was Noel was fabulous, lots of interaction and keeping in mind my husband Celts passion another day we set up another tour to Cliffs of Moher and it was wonderful to be taken to the cliffs through a back door entrance with less tourist it was just superb. We also added a third tour to Belfast with Michael a stunning tour guide with lots of passion and knowledge about history plus experiencing the real Game of Thrones filmed location and wonderful scenery, which our teenage liked so much. Miriam was extremely friendly, professional and gave us excellent service. She was very hospitable, accommodating and anticipated our needs and helped draw out what we wanted. She created a tailor made experience based on our preferences. Our trip was  paired with a unique local experience and her in depth insight into the local culture and community. I had a fabulous day in and around the sites of Dublin with Noel. Touristy created a wonderful itinerary for me based on the places I wanted to visit. Noel even took me to additional places that he thought I would like on the way to the ones I had asked to see. He really made sure I had a full and informative day. I was exhausted! Noel is a perfect guide and I highly recommend him and Touristy. The four of us just finished a top notch Wicklow Mountains tour with Noel!  He was so knowledgeable, kind and patient and he loves his beautiful country. He even delivered on great weather!  He provided airport pickup; highly recommended.  He will most definitely be one of our favorite Ireland memories!  Thank you Noel! Our trip was awesome to Newgrange ! Noel our driver and also out trip guide was friendly and shared great stories. We had a good day and kids and wife loved the tour. Highly recommended!! Brian was our guide for this super fun tour of Dublin by car we highly recommend! Brian put together a custom tour based on our conversation Dublin Bay, incredible views of Guinness Lake, lunch at Johnny Fox s pub.   Brian added his knowledgeable commentary from Dublin history and recent events. We were able to see what we wanted to see so each tour can be unique!   An added advantage, as a taxi driver he knows every inch of Dublin, and can drive in the special lane for buses and taxis! Noel was on time, suggested some excellent options and took us to visit an  ancestral  personal site too! Made the trip fun for our 16-year-old grandson too! Noel was a fantastic tour guide. Incredibly knowledgeable and kind, we felt we got a true local look behind the scenes. We had a great visit in Dublin with Noel He is a great guide, very organize, efficient, and profesional. Don t hesitate he is the best !!!! Noel was fantastic. Very knowledgeable and fun. Really added to our trip. Great time, first call tour. Noel was a perfect guide. Highly recommended Very knowledgeable and provided lots of options for activities to do. Great personality and easy conversation. I would definitely recommend to anyone nan"
202,Two Pups,4.725,"Lots of great options on the menu. Coffee was lovely & staff were friendly. Will definitely visit again. I visited with a friend and we were able to sit for ages chatting. Great little breakfast spot with good specialty coffee! There was a constant loud hammering sound from the back during my visit, so had to take a star off for that but otherwise a wonderful experience! Food Two Pups is by far the best of a great selection of cafes and coffee places in Dublin. The coffee is always perfectly made by the best baristas, the pastries and snacks are gorgeous, and the dishes are all absolutely delicious and you can tell they re made with the best possible ingredients. I ve been coming here for years and I just never get sick of it. Special shoutout to Finnuala who always looks after me and she is just the best! My favourite cafe in Dublin. There are some amazing coffee/lunch/brunch options in Dublin, and especially around Dublin 8. But the atmosphere and the staff make this place stand out for me. Friendly and chill. The coffee is taken seriously, prepared to an extremely high standard, above and beyond most cafes. No syrups here. The menu is small, elegant and frankly superb. Fresh, high-quality ingredients and it shows. If you are nearby you should try. Kid-friendliness: No high chairs, it gets quite busy at lunchtimes and weekends Lovely spot with so much seating available. Very tasty, quality food. We ordered the Mexican eggs and the breakfast bap. Wow! Everything was so fresh and tasty. Coffee was beautiful too Food : 5/5 I recently visited Two Pups Coffee, and it was a delightful experience. The cappuccino was hot and frothy, exactly how a good cappuccino should be. The highlight of my visit, however, was the sausage rolls. They were absolutely delicious. The sausage roll had a nice flavor to it, thanks to the addition of some black pudding wrapped with the sausage. The dough was crisp and flaky, making each bite a perfect blend of textures and flavors. In addition to the great food and coffee, the service was exceptional. A friendly red-headed woman greeted me warmly and made sure I was able to carry my takeaway without any issues. Her kindness and attentiveness added a personal touch to my visit, making it even more enjoyable. Overall, Two Pups Coffee is well worth a visit for anyone looking to enjoy quality coffee and tasty treats. This Irish cafe has certainly earned a spot on my list of favorites. Great spot for breakfast. Tasty menu options with high quality ingredients, cute and comfortable ambience and super friendly staff. Hands down my favorite brunch place in Dublin! The staff is always so lovely, the food is amazing, there s always a bit of a wait but I genuinely love going there so much. Definitely the place to be! This place is great! The flat white was delicious and the orange cake was tasty as well. Nice place to relax and have a cup of coffee. Unreal spot for coffee and pastries! Apparently the brunch is really good as well but we didn t try it. Everything was delicious. Staff was very nice and they did everything to accommodate us on a very busy day. Cute atmosphere! Food : 5/5 Got the potato hash for brunch. Absolutely Divine. Everything else looked fab too. Great delicious and pretty reasonable prices. Big inside the cafe which I didn t expect! Staff are lovely and it s cute inside. Definitely recommend checking this place out Vegetarian options: Absolutely fantastic Absolutely feel in love with this place from the moment we walked in and they were playing Aint It Fun by Paramore, I knew we were in the right place. Staff are so welcoming and friendly, and the food in is incredible. So fresh and tasty, and did I mention the hot sauce? Big fan and brought my own bottle to take home. We will be back, with love from your Welsh fans We chose this place because theyre dog-friendly. Lots of seating available and their staff are friendly. Their menu is small which is great because you know then that everything is cooked fresh. I had egg on toast and it was so tasty and full of flavour. The one disappointment that I had is that they dont serve pup cups which would really be a nice touch. Otherwise they are a lovely place for a bite to eat. Really cute little cafe in the Liberties! Menu didn t have as many options for vegetarian as I original thought - but I realised this place has a regularly changing menu with lots of different options, so would be interested in coming back again! My drink was also very nice! You have to way outside to be seated, fortunately we didn t have ti wait for more than 5 . The service is really polite and welcoming. I loved my choice, found the taste really interesting. The hot chocolate was okay. Nice atmosphere. A bit overpriced but that s how things seem to be in Dublin. Would go again If visiting Dublin. Lovely brunch spot, food is always amazing and the people are lovely! Definitely one of the best cafes in Dublin Nice hipster vibe. Very good food and excellent coffee: priced not cheap, but similar to other places in Dublin. Servers are great! However, management made the odd decision of giving half-arsed service: you get food at the table; you get water to your table; tables are cleared; but you CANNOT place an order from the comfort of your dining. Meaning, you place it at the till, and pay before receiving food or beverages (?!). Odd approach, to say the least... Two Pups is a great cafe. The staff makes you feel welcome when you arrive, and the cafe s atmosphere is relaxing and laid back. The coffee is fantastic and served at a good price, along with plenty of great food and take away options. Two Pups is a cafe I go to at least three times a week, usually more. It s a great cafe in Dublin and definitely worth a visit for both locals and tourists alike. Really good food, there is usually a queue outside. You pay at the desk. Recommend the potatoes & eggs is really nice morning meal, feel healthy. Right amount of good you would expect. Coffee is relatively good as well. Service is good. We mentioned we want the eggs running and it was perfectly cooked. We love this place and will come back. Almost once every 2-3 weeks Food was good if pricey. Probably no worse than most places for brunch these days though!The classic avocado on toast was good and the coffee was lovely. The star were the garlic potatoes with a lemon butter, delicious. No table service, order at the till. AMAZING PLACE! I had my breakfast here and I m in LOVE. Super friendly and welcoming staff, delicious food. The croissants dough is extremely delicate but so flavorful, milk and orange juice are spectacular. Calm and relaxing environment. 100% recommended. It was pretty, authentic, just YUM! There was a queue at the time we reached. 15 minutes later, we were able to go in. The place is mediocre, a bit old, and a bit expensive honestly. But maybe these prices are normal in Dublin. However, the food was pretty looking and tasty. You have to order your food at the counter and they will bring it to you. Service is ok, everyone looks positive but no one helps you to make choices if it s your first time. The cookies and cakes were tasty as well! Definitely recommend! Delicious meal and friendly service! Seating line moved quickly. Great cafe based in the Liberties. As the name suggest they are dog friendly which is a big plus as we had our dog with us at the time. We came here for an after lunch snack and had the peanut butter on toast and a raspberry, coconut and dark chocolate cake which were great. We would definitely come back to try the breakfast/brunch/lunch menu. The chai latte and filter coffee are also fantastic. Very good and welcoming service with a chill/relaxed vibe. Referred here from our hotel. Neat place with a cool vibe. Food was really good. One of the best cafes and brunch spots in Dublin. The coffee is perfect. The kitchen goes that extra mile to make brunch a real treat. Amazing cakes. The staff are so friendly and fun. Staff stay a long time which says a lot about the management. There is a genuinely friendly atmosphere. Superb spot for brunch. Dont let the line out the door discourage you, the place is bigger than it looks and they turn over tables quickly. The seasonal hash with black pudding was outstanding, but everything was good. Highly recommend. Vegetarian options: Many vegetarian options, very few vegan. Had the french toast and my goodness was incredible, great mix of savoury and sweet and fixed the hangover perfectly, nice coffee too Excellent excellent food and coffee!! Service was 11/10- would absolutely recommend for breakfast and/or coffee. Had an amazing brunch at this cafe! The ambience is really soothing. They ve good indoor and outdoor seating. Staff is friendly and courteous. The brunch was delicious. The beetroot turkish eggs were delicious and coffees were nice! SO. GOOD. I ordered an oat milk latte (steamed perfectly, not too hot, doesnt taste burnt or flat), along with the eggs & toast + bacon, and a side of garlic potatoes w/ lemon aioli. The toast is thick and crispy, the eggs a lovely medium/mw, perfectly salted, comes with sambal (spicy chili sauce) on the plate if you want to elevate the flavors even more. The potatoes were soft and crispy, the aioli just tangy enough, the plating simple and rustic. Im so happy I stopped here before the Cathedral. Im extremely picky about my lattes and they knocked it out of the park. Service was kind and quick, even sitting in the back courtyard (which felt like a Main Character moment). If I lived here I would be a regular. Vegetarian options: They have a small menu but its varied enough to suit most eaters. Dietary restrictions: They have dairy alternatives for coffee (oat milk steams the best, so thats what I look for) and ask you to divulge allergies when you order. Cute place for coffee or brunch. Has enough tables, so also during the weekend they are able to accommodate you quite quickly if there is a queue. Excellent experience, a cozy cafe that looks small from the outside but big on the inside. Friendly staff and the food is top notch. Fine crafted quality meals! Drinks were amazing as well! But Id like if the Chai tea had a cup handle, was quite hot just holding the glass cup by itself. Other than that, would visit again! Cool spot, queue outside moves quickly and interiors are nice. Order at the counter, and grab your own water etc but asked to tip when paying. Breakfast hash is 10 baby potatoes, some salad and two eggs for  16 - when asked if you want to add any sausages/bacon when ordering say yes or you ll be underwhelmed. Food : 2/5 Great food and coffee in a lovely setting. Definitely worth a visit. Its walk-in only, but the queue moves fairly quickly. Weve been the last 2 weeks and have waited about 20 mins both times. Love that its walk-in only when its so hard to get into other Dublin cafes without a reservation. There were 3 of us and we all loved our dishes - savoury French toast, Avo eggs and Turkish beetroot eggs. The mini brownies are very good too.  Highly recommend. Well be back! If we had one small criticism, it would be the price of the sides. Theyre a bit overpriced. Parking: Free on-street parking nearby, as well as paid options. Absolute hidden gem! Im convinced that no one does brunch like local shops. Two Pups reminds of the college that I attended university, earthy crunchy, young, upbeat, sustainable, rustic, and cozy! The staff goes above and beyond to be friendly, and the food is super creative. Its no longer on the menu, but their eggplant with fried hardboiled egg (yes, you heard that right) was spectacular! Be sure to try their Vietnamese Ice Coffee! ALSO they have more seating in the back/side, more than you think/can see from the outside (theres also an outdoor patio in the back)! I just really wish they were open more days of the week. Staff was so friendly, food was excellent. I ate the sandwich with meatballs which was delicious and huge. My friend took croissant, it was fresh and delicious too. Browni is worth to try! Last but not least coffee was professional and delicious: Big thanks to awesome barista. Outside sitting available. For sure, I will return back. Thanks for nice experience. Lovely spot with great and friendly service. Definitely a good spot for brunch and has a tempting selection of treats to finish. The breakfast bap was particularly tasty! Food is absolutely delicious. I have to confess I hardly empty my plate, and today I finished it. I had the beetroot salad, absolutely gorgeous. Tasty, light, thoroughly made to perfection. Staff is very friendly and the place has a different and special atmosphere. Definitely recommend it. Wonderful staff. Great coffee. The brunch seemed a bit pricey but the food was good nevertheless. Had a bit of a suggestion with the Green Shakshuka, the eggs are supposed to be runny and not completely fried and that s the essence of an authentic shakshuka. Apart from this all the food was great, coffee was excellent and loved the Lemon sponge slice"
203,Unearthed Tours Dublin - Free Walking Tours Of Dublin,5.0,"10/10 would highly recommend this tour if you have a few hours to spend in Dublin. City tours can be so tour-guide specific and we absolutely loved ours. Our tour guide was Steven, and he had lots knowledge of the area and the history of Ireland in general. We also appreciated his tongue in cheek humor to make the few hours we spent together more entertaining as sometimes tours can get a bit stale when learning so much history packed into a short amount of time. He really made sure we all had a great time while learning. We also appreciated his answers when we asked questions between stops, he was very thorough in his answers and we loved chatting with him. We ve been on many city tours and this was hands down in our top 2 ever!! I had two tours yesterday one in the morning where Jack(the guide) with a purple umbrella will guide us through the city and tell stories about Dublin beginning. I have learnt so much and I am glad I had this experience. He was engaging quite well with the group, very enthusiastic and proud of his country and made everything so enjoyable. The second one was an evening tour and it was good. Could not have had more fun with Steve! Visiting in February and had only 24 hours in Dublin, this was a great way to see more city sites and learn more history. Is there anything better than an Irishman telling dark stories on a windy night in Dublin? I hope I m saying this right bc I m still learning, but: it was good craic. Ciaran was our guide for the walking tour, and he was fantastic! He was informative and thoroughly explained things in a way that kept our group engaged. He was absolutely hilarious. I adored him. I would recommend his tour to anyone. Tara is an incredible guide through Dublin and Irish history being truly as Dubliner as possible as she says. It was engaging to walk with her through the city streets and listen to her amazing stories about the highlights and heritage of Ireland and Dublin. Her gift for storytelling together with excellent sense of humour made the tour really memorable. She is also open for questions and dialogue, making it all even more meaningful and fun. Taras tips for further exploring of the city and good places to visit such as pubs, restaurants, live music venues and everything else was also priceless. I would highly recommend the tour with Unearthed Tours as its a great way to start your Dublin and Irish journey or complete the existing image about it. If you happen to lack time for exploring city further, it will also give you just enough insights. Big thanks to Unearthed Tours and Tara. In a word: Fantastic. I brought a group tour to Ireland, and Annemarie and Cillian worked with us to coordinate booking the tour for multiple folks, combining us into our very own tour. They went above and beyond to accommodate our large group. Cillian, our tour guide and the co-owner, was knowledgeable and entertaining. He truly cares about Irish history and lore. This is more of a historical tour than strictly paranormal, and that was just fine with us. If youre looking for a jump-scare type of tour that presents as a haunted house, this isnt it. If you want to learn about some of the things that actually happened in Dublin history and left an energetic mark on the place, then do book this tour. There is a fair amount of walking, so plan for that, and be prepared to learn a lot about this history of the city of Dublin. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. A fantastic experience. Ciaran was a delightful guide, passionate, funny and extremely knowledgeable about Dublin and Irelands history. Took us to all the most important places but also showed us some secret gems. I really recommend doing this tour on the first or second day here as you will get to know the city better and youll know what to visit next. Ciaran was the best guide I had in all 36 countries I ve visited in my life. He s not only very knowledgeable, providing plenty of information about Dublin and Ireland, but delivers an extremely interesting and fun walking. His energy and enthusiasm are contagious and his advices on what to visit are precious! I m very glad to have booked the walking tour and would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin! What a great first tour in Dublin! Our guide gave us such great stories as we walked around and we learned a lot about the dark side of Dublin! Best tour in Dublin! Ciaran was so informative, and a great story teller! I would 1000% recommend to book and get a proper tour of Dublin. He was above and beyond!! We even met famous street artist Maser!! This tour was an amazing way to see the city of Dublin. I have been here for a couple of months, and I had not realized how close together everything was. Steven was our tour guide, and he made everything fun and engaging the entire time. All while intertwining modern and historic facts about all the things we experienced. One thing to note: Since this is a free tour, bring cash for tip. We took the Dark Dublin Guided Walking Tour 11/22, 5:30 pm. Kieran was a knowledgeable, entertaining, welcoming guide. He made sure to talk to everyone on the tour-ask where they were from, any questions, give recommendations for food/entertainment/activities. We learned so much about the History of Dublin and visited some sites we would never have gone to unless on the tour. We highly recommend taking this tour. Things to know- *it is a lot of walking and there are stairs. *Take a water bottle as it is a Activity packed full 2 hours-hydrate. *Ask lots of questions-Kieran has a wide range of knowledge, not just the specifics of the tour. *pre-arrange a taxi to meet at the last spot, there is no easy place to flag down a taxi. Engaging walking tour, led at the perfect pace for the intellectually-curious adult. Killian was very knowledgeable and passionate about his work   a good combination of historical and down-to-Earth that I always love about free tours! Thank you for introducing me to Dublin! I just finished a delightful tour with Ciaran and would highly recommend his tour to everyone interested in a local s guide to Dublin or anyone who s interested in some Irish history. I really enjoyed how diverse his tour was - thank you again, Ciaran! We did the dark Dublin walking tour and it was such a great way to see the city and learn so many facts about Dublin that not most people know. We covered a big area and our guide was really happy to answer any questions and had great recommendations for what to do whilst we were in Dublin. This free walking tour was amazing! Jack was our tour guide and he was fantastic. He was informative and thoroughly explained things in a way that kept our group engaged. We learned a lot about Dublin and Ireland and saw many nice places across Dublin. I highly recommend this tour to everyone :) We did the dark dublin tour with Ciaran and he was an excellent tour guide for a fascinating tour. It included all kinds of macabre history and stories from Dublin and all around Ireland. Ciaran had a great sense of humor and was obviously very knowledgeable about Irish history. We thoroughly enjoyed this tour. Kieron managed to tell us a lot about Ireland s history and sights in an easy-to-understand and even entertaining way. He also gave us great recommendations about where to eat, drink and what else to visit. We also loved the fact that he spoke very loudly and clearly which is not the case with every tour guide. We would absolutely recommend this tour. Best thing we did in Dublin ! James you are a great storyteller. Fantastic places and great insights into Dublin and Irish history, tradition and culture. Will be back for sure. I loved this walking tour!! I did the Womens Walking Tour and it was incredible! Our tour guide was very engaging and very knowledgeable not only about the history of women in Dubin, but about the city itself! I loved learning about the different roles of women in Dublins history!! I highly recommend this tour! From beginning to end this walking tour with Jack Redmond was outstanding. His humor mixed with excellent history lessons was refreshing and engaging. My two teen age girls said it was the best tour they had every done - anywhere - and they were enthralled the whole time as well. Do yourself a favor and sign up for one of these tours, a great way to start your trip in Dublin (and Ireland)! Thank you! Hands down the best walking tour in Dublin!! I bring tour groups to Ireland and over the years I ve tried a number of different walking tours with different guides for my groups but BY FAR, Ciaran has been the best guide we ve ever had! Super knowledgeable, very professional and above and beyond hilarious. 10 stars!!! We took the free walking tour on our first day in Dublin. The tour covers a lot of ground in the south side of the city. Killian, our guide, was fantastic! He was very knowledgeable and fun! We had a great time and highly recommend this tour! We were only in Dublin for 2 nights but this walking tour was definitely the best activity that we did. Our guide was knowledgeable, entertaining and engaging. We got to learn about parts of the city that we would have walked straight past had we not done this tour. We were a big group so the company put on an extra guide and split the group into two to make it more personal. Our guide also had a loud and clear voice so it was easy to hear what he was telling us. Tara, was absolutely awesome! Very easy to understand, hospitable, funny, knowledgeable, provided great recommendations, and we look forward to booking with her again when we return!  Invest your $ into a tour with Tara! Well worth it! What an Irish Welcoming!! A-W-E-S-O-M-E tour!! Ciaran was our tour guide and he was totally one of the best tour guides I had! A great balance of history, fun facts, suggestions and deep knowledge of Dublin! Definitely one thing all those 10 things to do in Dublin net articles should add to their list I took the Dark Dublin Tour and I would highly recommend this tour! The tour guide was great and gave tons of information about the history of what dark and terrible things have occurred at each site that he took us to. He was very knowledgeable about Dublin and was able to answer every question. He explained everything in detail and was very animated with the storytelling. The stories were fascinating! Ciaran was our guide for a Dark Dublin Guided  walking tour. Outstanding! He shared great tidbits of local lore, both of national significance and local, too. Really funny and knowledgeable guy who was entertaining throughout. He encouraged questions from the group and stayed after to answer more. I d recommend him for any of the tours this group offers. Unbelievable walking tour in Dublin! Ciaran was not only extremely knowledgeable but very funny! Making the history and the hidden gems of Dublin an extra special part of our trip! Highly recommend! Perfect start of your stay in Dublin. Our guide Ciaran gave a great introduction to the history of Ireland, excellent advice on what to do in Dublin and which bars (not) to go to in Temple Bar. He had a great sense of humor too. Highly recommended! Highly recommend!!! The best of Irish history made fun. I have done the  Discover Dublin and its hidden gems  tour with Cieran and I have to say of all the walking tours I ve done so far this is one of my faves. It goes through most of the main Dublin attractions (St Stephen s park, new and old parliaments, trinity college, temple bar, the castle etc), all Qs are answered, knowledge packed and lots of laughter in between. I ve really liked how at the end of the tour he s done a wee recap of everything we ve seen so far and that he s given loads of recommendations and tips to get around. I also recommend to do the tour the first day of your stay in Dublin to know your way around the city, take advantage of all the advice and suggestions  and decide  what you want to explore in more depth. What an amazing tour! Ciaran walked us as much through Irish history as the city itself and showed so much passion and interest that it was hard not to be infected. Despite the drizzle we had an amazing time and would highly recommend this tour to everyone who wants to know more about Dublin and the Irish. We really loved our walking tour!!! Our guide Jack Redmond was wonderful, he knew absolutely anything and everything about Dublin s history! We heard some interesting (and sometimes wacky!) stories along the way, so as well as being informative, it was also funny. Some more sensitive topics of Irish history were mentioned too, so very thought provoking in places. Jack also kindly gave us a QR code to scan with articles he had written about recommendations for restaurants / pubs / things to do / day trips outside of Dublin etc. which was so useful as we had never been to Ireland before! I think the tour would be suitable for anyone of any age. You don t do much strenuous walking (each check point was only 5 or so minutes from the last and you stay in the central city area) but do remember you will have to be standing for 2.5 hours (so maybe don t bring any heavy bags). One small potential improvement would be maybe the opportunity for a quick toilet stop (if there are free public toilets in Dublin I don t know?). Obviously we were allowed to leave at any time, but didn t want to miss any of the action by going off on our own to find a toilet, so would be nice to integrate that into the tour in case anyone needs to go. Overall an excellent experience and would 100% recommend! We enjoyed this free tour with Ciaran so much! It is very well documented and he was very passionate and enthusiastic about his city. It s so nice to go around Dublin with a local. We highly recommend doing it when you don t have much time to get documented yourself. Ciaran is an amazing tour guide! We joined him for a Dublin city tour right after Saint Patricks, and Im still thinking about it. We left the tour happy and inspired by the way he presented Irelands history and the modern times! Im really sorry we only had limited cash on hand, it was genuinely one of the best tours Ive been on. One of the best walking tours Ive done. Jack is an incredible guide. He took us all around Dublin and told us everything we need to know about the history of the city, without being boring and repetitive. He was funny and smart and you can sense that he cares about this beautiful city a lot. I highly recommend the tour and jack in particular. The best tour we did in the 8 days in Ireland. Ciaran was terrific! The info. he tells about the history was presented in a way that was relatable, interesting and entertaining. He has a friendly, outgoing personality. Highly recommend taking a tour with Unearthed Tours Dublin. Definitely a different type of tour to take! I had a great time and loved hearing all of Kirans stories. His humor is fantastic. Even recommended places to grab a pint and info about general life in Dublin. Keep up the good work- support small businesses! I went on the Dark Dublin walking tour with Killian, and it was excellent! I m very familiar with Dublin and it s history, but a lot of what was covered was new for me too! And Killian kept things light when he could, but also didn t shy away from explaining the brutal history. It s an excellent way to spend two hours, whether you know something about the history of Dublin or not! Cathal was our guide, and had a wonderful introduction to Dublin, and a great sense of humor.  We really enjoyed the tour and would highly recommend it to anyone.  Its such a wonderful and approachable experience and way to learn about the city."
204,Vice Coffee Inc,4.65,"Stopped in here on a food tour of Dublin and had an authentic Irish coffee.  Staff were informative, helpful and service was excellent.  Have yet to successfully recreate the coffee here in Canada to the level we had at Vice.  I even bought a nice bottle of Teeling.  The cream pour is vitally important. Excellent coffee! Great Mexican influenced food and a super atmosphere. Slightly confusing at first as the premises houses an amalgamation of two businesses, Vice Coffee & Wigwam, a fun late night drinking venue. But worth ignoring that conflict for the coffee they are producing. Smooth and elegantly presented it is a must try on the Dublin Coffee Scene. Located in Middle Abbey Street it is easily accessible and the Luas runs past the front door. Toilets are clean and well maintained on the upper floor where there is also access to a roof terrace. In the bowels you will find an Uber cool games area featuring table tennis. The juxtaposition between the two businesses is made obvious with the empty stage at ground level. This is a main feature of Wigwam with live entertainment and DJs a regular feature. Well worth a look for either venue!! To find the place is a bit tricky, collaborative with a different location (wigma), As for the toasties disappointment, not enough cheese, barely melting in your mouth. The addional relish was a nice touch but not covered up for the mess up for lack of cheese. Service was fast both for the food and the hot drinks considering the high peak that was in the place. The table was too sticky as if not enough time to clean between costumers just to swip the crumbs from last dashes but nothing more. We stopped for a coffee and toastie as a late morning snack, both were wonderful. The staff were really friendly and the venue itself is fantastic. Don t go to the big fast food chains for lunch / coffee, go to Vice instead. Went in to try their signature Irish coffees, and they didnt disappoint! Shared the Fancy Frankie and Luxurious Linda with my partner and both were fragrant, flavourful and very smooth. The staff were also friendly and happy to chat about them to us. As a bonus, we knew wed get some good quality espresso in our drinks when we saw the Square Mile beans on offer just next to us. I just popped in after a bit of shopping to try their coffee as it was highly recommended by a friend. Got a flat white along with a brownie and it was good. There happened to be a drag show and the place was pretty lively and fun. Their staffs are very friendly too so would no doubt recommend this and prolly try more stuffs on their menu. Always a pleasure to stop by! Amazing service, unbelievable treats (lemon bar and chocolate chip were yummy) and the coffee - wow, from another world. The coffee three ways should become a standard offering in all cafes - ingenious! Thank you for being such rockstars! The aesthetic is lovely with subtle neon light in the bar area. I ordered the award winning Irish coffee at  9 and can see why its so expensive after one sip. Theres probably 2 shots of spirit inside. It was far too strong for me to drink so I couldnt finish it. Taste wise, theres alot going on. Its not bad per say but its not for me. Ill be sticking with the regular Baileys Irish coffee. The soffee we got was great. I came twice during our stay in Dublin and tried filtered coffee, friend had Irish coffee. Next time I tried three way - espresso, espresso macchiato (called piccolo here) and cold brew. I cannot say anything against any of these coffees - espresso had nice acidity, latte art was spot on etc. The only issue is the interior - it is a party of some bar, so it does not look very cozy or nice to sit inside for a cup of coffe. Sat in here for about 3 hours. Friendly service, great aeropress and v60 and an incredibly good cheese toastie with a free tunnocks on the side The place in Dublin if you want to drink an Irish coffee!! Not so easy to find in the city and whats more, their Irish is really good! They also serve cocktails there, but not tested... nice terrace... The place was very cute, I liked the vibe and the general decorations. I went there for a coffee and the people there were lovely. The coffee was delicious but the lemon cake a bit too sweet. Overall, nice! Def, recommend it (: Food : 4/5 Lovely spot for a tasty lunch. The hot chocolate is great, chocolate milkshake really nice and Vietnamese Iced Tea very pleasant. Loved the chicken chipotle toastie and nice to have a cooling pint of cider. Felt very safe at this time of covid. Ate in the roof garden, so nice and quiet. Next time we might go later for the Wigwam menu. Lovely people and a great spot I had the special irish coffee. It was quite pricey but totally worth it for me! The staff was very nice as well. They gave me iced water after I finished my coffee. There were also lots of other interesting options on the menu so I definitely would come back to try them if I have a chance. A great place to engage in all sorts of vices. Hot chocolate with Baileys was top notch, service was wonderful, and the peanut butter brownie was almost as sinful as the hot chocolate. Plan to go back tomorrow earlier in the day for Irish Coffee! Beautiful coffee and the sandwich was sensational, very tasty nice atmosphere service really good Decided to go for my first ever Irish coffee last Saturday. So good  ! Literally if you haven t tried one, try Vice! I had the Plain Jane typical Irish coffee. So good and easy drink. Not overbearing! Perfect. The award winning Irish coffee is a must order. The orange citrus shaving and nutmeg in top does wonders for the aromatics and combines beautifully with the temperatures and textures of the drink. Would have orders another but thought it best to save space to try something else in Dublin too  . This is a must when in Dublin. Absolutely the best Irish coffe I have ever tasted. Great personell. The place is very modern. We happened to be there while there was a drag show (also great show) so the overall atmosphere were great. Please make sure you try the Irish coffe. This place is great. Very charming - inside of bar called Wigwam. I had the Roasted Turkey and Thyme and PB&J Toasties, along with an aeropress coffee. I can recommend them all. Bonus: there is free WiFi inside, so I watched YouTube while I slowly ate. 5 stars. They got Vietnamese iced coffee here with a generous dollop of condensed milk! This will be my go to spot for breaks if I m shopping near this area again! Top class coffee with large space inside - we felt very welcomed but not overly interrupted too This place could easily be 5 stars if it wasnt freezing inside. Friendly staff, good coffee, okay food, and a nice environment, but I had to wear my winter coat and scarf inside while trying to enjoy a coffee and flip through a book. I ended up leaving after about 15 min because I couldnt stand it Such an uncomfortable situations! I was there finish my Irish coffee + cookie ( 15) them some of the staff decided put my table and the table beside together, took a sign on my table, minutes latter other staff ask me to leave the table because they needed back Whats???? How you can treat your clients like that? Is not my fault that someone forgot to organize your place. About service -10 horrible experience... Vice Coffee Inc. in Dublin is a coffee gem. Exceptional brews, inviting atmosphere, and passionate baristas make it a must-visit for coffee enthusiasts. Tom is the best and so is the Irish coffee. He told us which pubs to go to and those to avoid. Thanks Food Best coffee I had in Ireland, and I tried some good ones! The barista was super friendly, and made us a very special cortado. Cool place too. Discovered this place while doing a food tour : the lads that we making the coffees are really good craic ! True baristas ! Great atmosphere here, the space is shared with a bar, they share the lease. Therefore its a very versatile space. I came here and sampled the Irish coffee as part of a food tour. It was so good that I came back just to try the full-sized version. Its extremely refined and will definitely ruin any standards you have for other Irish coffees! My favorite regular and Irish coffee spot in Dublin thus far. Fancy Frankie Irish coffee must try spot Loveliest staff, brilliant coffee and great selection of sambos and Irish coffees. Couldn t recommend enough! Coffee is obviously solid but what I like so much about this place is that they offer beans on bar from outside of Ireland. Had a white red brick for the first time and its so good I didnt wanna finish it. Tasting notes orange and chocolate shine through, its solid espresso. This place ticks all the boxes, they also use village dairy and have really sound staff. I might just become a regular :). Pretty swan too! Great Irish coffees - get the Fancy Frannie! Really good coffee, nice space, laid back atmosphere Vegetarian options: Vegan and vegetarian options for brunch/lunch Azong coffee and cakes, they also do a mean Irish coffee. Service is top notch. Flat white taste okay, very strong, not really my kind but the people their are very friendly Best Irish coffee in Dublin hands down. Fresh nutmeg on the top was a nice touch. Really nice place to escape for an hour with an excellent flat white and a book up on the roof garden. Friendly staff with a great vibe. My wife and I came to Vice on a walking food tour in October and loved the Irish coffee s (her the Fancy Frankie, me the Luxurious Linda). We went a couple mornings after that as we were staying close by. We just came back in June and made a visit. It was so good once again. We even bought the at home Irish coffee kit and it was great! Worth the visit just for the Irish coffee but they have so much more. The music is a bit loud for me but that s probably because I was studying. Other than that everything is amazing. The staff is so kind and friendly. The food is pretty good, I ve tried the vegan toastie and it was delicious. Also the peppermint tea smells DIVINE Vegetarian options: Many vegan options Good coffee beans, nice oat milk, unique and exceptional atmosphere."
205,Viking Legacy Trails,5.0,"he brought history to life for our kids- best part of our trip! I have a child with autism and Bren was super accommodating, personalising the tour to accommodate both my sons. On the day of the tour, there was no way my kids were going to do a walking tour in the cold, wet rain but I didnt want to cancel! Bren agreed to come to our hotel to give his presentation in the lobby. He lugged all of his gear and weapons and props and heavy shields to us without complaint (10 stars for that!). He was engaging and kind; dressed them up (complete with viking war paint) and told them stories, took lots of pics and taught them to sword fight. Battling a viking to the ground was the hi light of our trip. We look forward to coming back to Dublin- when its sunny- and doing the actual tour in the viking quarter! Definite must do - rain or shine! Absolutely Phenomenal Viking Tour Experience with Bren! Where do I even begin? Bren took us on a journey through Viking history that felt more like a captivating conversation with an old friend than a traditional tour. His depth of knowledge is astounding, weaving history seamlessly with humor, making every moment both enlightening and enjoyable. Behind his Viking armor lies a heart of gold, evident in his genuine care for his country and its rich heritage. The only downside? The tour ended too soon! Bren, youre a true master of your craft, and were eagerly anticipating what the future holds for you. Thank you for an unforgettable experience! I ts the most amazing, passionate, full of history tour. It was such an excellent time that completely overcome the expectations! Walking with a  real  Viking around medieval Dublin, getting to know such amazing details that couldn t been told in those regular same like tours. It s a mandatory point on Dublin s checklist of things to do and the host makes it so worthy, interesting and exciting! Imagine a Viking with the most nice and enthusiastic character that will make you fall in love with Ireland! Absolutely loved it and 100% recommend it! I loved the viking tour! Bren loves his history, and is really knowledgeable. His costume and his weapons are amazing and he makes the tour enormous fun as well as really interesting. You will see much more than you would just walking round on your own. 100% recommend! This was an incredible tour! It included the perfect amount of information and ground covered. The guide was deeply knowledgeable and passionate about Viking history, it was infectious! Everyone should take this tour, it was a fantastic way to experience Dublin. My friend  Helen and myself did a tour with our own Private Viking Bren. We had a ball from begining to end. Bren is passionate about our Viking heritage and his knowledge of the subject  is amazing. It was eye opening. It is such a shame that Wood Quay has been built over in favour of a cement monstrosity. Our heritage is so much more valuable  to us than an office building. Thank you Bren it was a blast. Pauline  and Helen. Kilkenny. Bren was amazing!  He has a deep and rich understanding of Viking culture and knowledge.  He also is a phenomenal story teller and keeps your interest.  He was in the show called Vikings and Vikings Valhalla and wears that gear during your tour.  Everyone knows Bren and the kids want to come up and get a pictures with him.  Overall it was a great experience. Bren was our very knowledgeable guide on this vikings tour and was phenomenal. He told stories, was respectful and he is just a standup guy.  Hes an actor, body guard, musician, and just a wonderful human who is also all inclusive. When we ordered this tour, we didnt know what to expect. We arrived at the pick-up location and met our fantastic dedicatet guide Bren, dressed in a full viking costume. He told us the Dublin viking history with great passion and showed us locations that is nearly impossible to locate ourselves. According to the program the tour was supposed to take 2 hrs, but due to his engagement and passion for the history and also to answer our question, it took early 3 hrs. A big thank for his story telling and information. He really got us to understand the viking history impact on Dublin. My wife and I had a wonderful time on the tour today with Brendan. From the beginning, his deep passion for history of the Viking past and the legacy of it in present day Dublin was obvious. The tour was fun, informative and detailed. Brendan was very generous with his time and energy and delivered above and beyond what we would have expected. We wholeheartedly recommend it as a must do while in Dublin! Overwhelming experience! Bren is the most friendly and openly person weve met while staying in Dublin. Very interesting history brought to life by the viking of Dubh Linn. He took very much time and gave us great tips where we could experience more of the irish culture in and around Dublin. We will see us again! Fun, informative and interesting to talk about history with Bren. He is very patient and holds a lot of information. Dont be afraid to ask questions as he enjoys answering them. Great to have Luna, the dog, with you along the way. Go down to old streets and paths that other tourists do not walk and have a great personalized experience. Highly recommend! This is by far the most amazing tour of Dublin that I have done. You find yourself roaming the streets of Dublin alongside a Viking warrior as Bren takes you far back in time to make you discover Dublin s Viking history and legacy, as well as a few fascinating stories and legends related to various places in the city. The tour is both highly entertaining and insightful. Bren is an amazing human being and he is truly passionate and knowledgeable about Viking and Dublin history. If you have to pick one tour to discover Dublin city, this is the one! A tour not to be missed !!! ,Fabulous tour that I would recommend highly to all visitors and locals. Brendan is a fantastic tour guide with great knowledge of Dublin and its viking connections. I will be definitely joining this viking warrior again next time I visit Dublin. Great city ,great people and a fun packed day on this tour. I would recommend this tour for all ages.. Skol   ,Thank you Brendan Fabulous time with Bren on the Viking tour. Great for kids and adults. Fun and educational. He loves what he does and it shows. Highly recommend. A++ This was such an amazing knowledgable experience. Bren the tour guide is done to look like a Viking!! His doggie Luna joins the tour from time to time and she fits in perfectly!! I was lucky to have been able to book a VIP tour so all of questions were answered with such pleasure and ease. I not only learned about Vikings! I learned about the history of Dublin and the crazy amazing things that happened and came from Dublin! I would recommend this to everyone!! This is was one of the most knowledgeable and adventurous tour I have ever been on. He really takes you back into the time, and you can get a great sense of what it was like back at that time. Bren was an amazing tour guide. He had a wealth of information to give, even non-viking related but still Dublin related. I highly recommend his tour. He was very entertaining and kept our 8 year old daughter involved asking questions to her and pointing out little things for her interest. We had an absolute blast on this tour! It was very intimate, and Bren was our tour guide. He was dressed in full Viking gear, which was a lot of fun! He was very knowledgeable about the history, and every building that we passed. He pointed things out that we would never have known to look at. He also answered questions we had about Ireland in general. He recommended a wonderful place for dinner and we quite enjoyed it, we highly recommend this walking tour! This tour was lovely! The website mentions meeting around Max and recommends it as a quick bite or coffee - I checked it out and the recommendation is well deserved! The tour takes you through the medieval quarters with many interesting facts and history being shared. Bren was fun, knowledgeable, engaging and very friendly. Even though we were on tour others kept coming up and asking for pictures with him - being dressed like a Viking will grab the attention of many - he kindly never said no. I d recommend this to anyone who s a fan of Viking history but also history of Ireland, I would definitely do this again if I found myself back in Ireland (which I hope I do!) This tour was epic! I ve spent over 6 years living in Dublin and it was so special to walk the Viking trail with such a passionate and knowledgeable guide. This is a perfect activity for a group in Dublin. Amazing value for money too! Bren went above and beyond to ensure we understood what we needed and that we were comfortable throughout the tour. We had enough time to take pictures and ask any questions. Really amazing time & unforgettable experience! Extraordinarily enjoyable tour with a passionately knowledgeable Viking in full regalia. Great information about the Viking era in Dublin and across Europe. Be prepared for other tourists to stare at you in envy! Viking Legacy Trails gave us the best historical walking tour we ve ever experienced. Best time ever with Bren the Viking! Learned so much about the history of Dublin while having a ton of fun!!! Definitely recommend to everyone! It was an excellent experience! And the highlight of our stay in Dublin. Bren is an amazing tour guide and truly passionate about vikings and their history! I learnt so much aswell as meeting his lovely dog Luna. I highly recommend this tour if you are in Dublin! What a great day with Bren. He showed us all the historic points and the history of the Vikings in Dublin. We had so much fun during the tour. It was an amazing experience with an awesome guide. Visited on What a fabulous afternoon ! Bren was so engaging & full of interesting facts & stories of Viking Dublin. Hes great company & Id highly recommend for both adult groups & families...not your usual guided tour as its something special.  Paul & Grainne. Dublin. If youre looking to dive deep into Dublins Viking history (the real history), the Viking Legacy Trails tour is an absolute must! Led by an amazing guide dressed as an authentic Viking, this tour brings the citys rich past to life in the most captivating way. The tour is not just about facts and dates; its an experiential journey that makes history tangible and exciting. PS. You might even recognise your charismatic and knowledgeable guide from somewhere! THANK YOU Viking Legacy Trails! What can I say? That was the most engaging and epic guided tours I have ever been to. They really delivered and gave a proper show, both in an entertaining way but of course also with a great depth of history knowledge. We were a group of 18 lads for a Bachelor party and this was the highlight of the trip. We can strongly recommend it! Bren meets the group for walking tour in Viking outfit which is great. Even better is his entertaining and educational description of the medieval sites along the tour of medieval Dublin.  My girlfriend and I were on a few walking tours while in Ireland and this one was by far the best Bren was a great guide and stayed late to take photos and answer everyones questions. We met up with him later that night for a pint at ODonoghues where he played a cracking flute solo Myself and my girlfriend booked this tour and absolutely loved every moment, Bren is a total legend, such passion towards the viking world. He bought us on a gougous journey throughout the area teaching us the viking worlds and ways that once was and he continues the experience of his knowledge and devotion towards its history. Highy recommend this tour, youll never feel in SAFER hands! Great tour, great guide! Learned so much about the history of Vikings and saw much of the beautiful city. And I got to hold Ragnar s actual axe from the show Vikings! Looking forward to seeing Bren in Vikings: Valhalla. 100% must do excursion! This was an historically accurate, fact filled and enthralling tour.  Get a real feel for the historic center of Dublin and skip the jokes and plastic horn helmets of other tour operators.  Dublins past is so interesting . Dont hestitate to book this tour!   Wow! Brendan really knows his Viking stuff! Perhaps this is because he actually is a living breathing viking himself! What a fabulous tour for all ages, interesting, funny, great photo opportunities and a fabulous way to see old Dubh Linn and learn about the huge Viking settlement here! Thank you Brendan (and lovely Luna, the beautiful dog! Alice and family :-) Great walk across Dublin with Bren Mor ! A lot about viking and anglo-normand history in Dublin ! It was a splendid way to know Medieval Dublin. My students loved it. You can t miss it! We had a very great Time and much fun with our Viking Tour Guide Bren. The history about the Vikings in Ireland was very interesting, an he took time for every Question we had. We really can recommended it. Bren was very knowledgeable and brought the whole viking Dublin experience to life.  We had an incredible afternoon Absolutely fantastic day. So much information to share and a thoroughly brilliant viking. What more could you want. Made our day.x  (buy tickets in advance you wouldnt want to miss out) Awesome experience! We had so much fun at the tour. Bren took us to beautiful places in dublin and told us a lot about viking history in ireland. He also gave us some great tips for dublin for our next days. We will definitely come back! Viking Legacy Tour is a must do! When asking my hotel for a walking tour, they raved about Viking Bren. Now I have a chance to rave. He is a Viking! He takes you back in time. Kids circle him and stop in awe. The walk is casual. Bren is passionate with incredible knowledge and even shares the small fun details. Our last stop was the 300 year historic Tailor s Hall (cave like with ancient wood beams). Stay for lunch! Don t miss VikingLegacyTrails.ie. . Lisa V"
206,Viking Splash Tours,4.875,"The most enjoyable sightseeing tour Ive been on in a long while. The guide, Vinny, was pumped with energy and delivered a comedy-club-worthy series of observations warmly mocking Dublins past and present. The pretty unique amphibious gimmick was just one of several highlights, which included roaring at unexpected passers by. It lasted over an hour - I could have stayed for another. Great fun! Awesome way to see, Dublin and learn some snippets of very important history that makes you want to find out more. Tour guide was very funny and knowledgeable and a great craic. Would recommend and come again great for kids and adults. Amazing trip! The tour guide was super friendly! Got to know loads about Dublin history and it has developed over the centuries. Absolutely brilliant tour and would definitely recommend , suitable for adults and kids .  We had Chris and Mary who guided the tour they were both lovely and Chris was hilarious . Lots of humour but also very educational Fabulously funny tour of Dublin through land and water. Our guide Conor (with one N) was very informative as he was funny. Thoroughly enjoyable for all ages, and a must do activity while in Dublin!! ROOOOAARRR!!!!! *you have to pre book and arrive 15 minutes early like the email states! They do leave bang on time and will leave without you, as happened to two unfortunate people! (Who were told they ll have to get the next one) but hey rules are rules! Very knowledgeable guide, showed us all the different part of Dublin. Very funny. The whole ride took about 1 hour or so. About 15 mins of it we went into the water. The weather was good. Would recommend! Viking Splash is not a classic city tour, but a very funny alternative. We enjoyed the tour with Winnie who was very kind, making us laugh a lot and providing background information about Dublin in a very entertaining, professional way. We would definitely do the tour again. Great fun for young and old. Guide is very funny and knowledgeable. Highly recommended. The tour brings you from St Stephens Green to Dublin Castle and Christchurch, along the north quays near The Four Courts and past the Customs House - with a drive through Geordian Dublin. The trip includes a boat trip  in Grand Canal basin with a view of the U2 recording studios. The vihicke used is a DUKW. Our guide advises that these vehicles were built by ladies only for General Motors during World War II, a DUKW is an amphibious six wheel drive vehicle shaped like a boat. They were once used for transporting goods and troops over land and water. Loved it! I had Keith and his Vietnamese driver, whose name I cant remember, possibly Vic. But Keith was absolutely great, very informative, and very fun. We had a good laugh during it too. Highly recommended. Thanks again, folks! So far the best tour weve had in Dublin!  Booked this on a whim and we were lucky to get Vinnie... Ask for Vinnie...!!  The guy is hilarious and absolutely awesome at what he does. We were in tears from laughing and all roaring like Vikings by the end of it. Absolutely worth every penny and then some! Absolutely brilliant. Kenny was our tour guide he was witty and made us laugh throughout. Highly recommend for people of all ages! We saw these duck boats whilst roaming around Dublin and decided to book on a whim. After reading some reviews we came into this a little bit skeptical, many mentioned laughter and fun. This is a very personal thing and forced fun is my absolute worst nightmare. However, Chris, our tour guide, and Mary our driver were excellent. Cynical, a little dark, a little loud, but very entertaining. Dont go into this however if you take yourself or your country too seriously. Overall, even with a minor delay due to our clutch failing and having to swap boats/cars, me and my girlfriend had an amazing time. Thanks Chris! On our visit with family in Dublin, we went on this tour.  Would recommend for kids and kids at heart. You get a different view of Dublin that included a dip in the water. Mary and Chris were lovely. Only bad thong was the wonderful Irish weather. 4 season in one day?? More like 4 seasons in one hour!! This would ve been a mid or average tour  but Vinny the guide made it great. He was funny and knowledgeable. He basically is the Conan O Brien of tour guides. He made it very funny and entertaining even though it was freezing. Give Vinny a raise immediately. The tour not only involves a plunge into the water but also provides a lot of information about Dublin and Irelands rich history. My boat presenter was a hilarious person. absolutely amazing tour guide, great fun, and definitely worth the price. Thank you to cara (our tour guide) for making such an amazing experience for us, our German penpals enjoyed it very muchv Very good tour of Dublin in a coach going both on the road and on the water... The tour of the city allows us to have several anecdotes from the guide who knows how to put us in a Viking atmosphere. After this 1h30 visit, which passed quickly, we left with a smile and a beautiful presentation of the city. Entertaining and interesting to a degree, we learned more history about U2 and Riverdance than we did about any kind of vikings, would have been nice to not wear plastic helmets that have been used a million times, for the price you pay for the tour of Dublin and a few minutes in the water they could at least give you a clean new helmet to use and to take home. It wasnt the worst tour Ive ever been on but it could be better, and the tour guide seemed like he might have had a hangover which is a bit unbecoming. I get that its Dublin and people drink a lot but at least try have a backup plan for a hungover tour guide. Apart from that no issues. Great job guys. I would still recommend people try it, maybe theyll be a bit luckier than us, tour guide was very funny. This is a MUST DO tour in Dublin City, if you re after 90min of laughs and fun!! There s something for everyone, no need to hop on and off this one, just sit back and enjoy the ride! Not just for tourists, locals would enjoy this tour just for laughs too! We were walking past midweek and our kids pointed out the big yellow tanks filled with people dressed as vikings, begging us to join the fun! The group were about to set off and we were lucky enough to grab the last 4 seats on the bus with our tour guide Vinnie, who was full of energy and laughs. It was like being at a stand up comedy show and a tour all at the same time! There was so much to take in a he drove around the city and then took us into the water and back. He had the group engaged in  Viking behaviour  and the kids were absolutely loving it! This experience was unlike anything we have done before - Highly recommend booking online in advance so you don t miss out! Ask to go with Vinnie too! Great Fun and fantastic jokes all the way through. Learned some fun facts about Bono, didnt know he could walk on water Super fun guide with a great driver. The city and the water tour was interesting and fun and we saw things we wouldn t with a  normal  city tour. The stories and songs made it to an extraordinary experience. I give you a big  rooaaaaaar 1,2,3 ROAR!!! Such a fun tour to do for the whole family. Our tour guide and driver were Peter and Bryan today. They were so much fun interacting with everyone on the ship and even off the ship. Definitely book in advance but if you are like us and took a chance the day of, they are willing to help you find a spot on a later tour. Which is the only reason we had to wait an hour. Thank you for laughs and showing us your town today! Great craic! Good alternative classic hop on  hop off. With Irish humor and water experience.  Tour takes about 1.5 hours, going through the city center mostly, about 15 minutes you spend on water. Absolutely brilliant tour, would highly recommend it. Great laughs, great commentary by tour guide and the whole experience was fantastic. 2 adults and 2 kids and all enjoyed it so much. Really cool tour. The guide Chris is a funny guy, always joking. You see some parts of Dublin and get basic informations of the history of the places you pass. Top banter from Keith, was a really fun tour of the city with a great mixture of history, information/facts and certainly humour. Yes it s quite expensive, but what isn t in Dublin?! It s certainly more fun than a standard bus tour that s for sure, thankfully we were blessed with sunny weather. Would highly recommend if you want a tour of the city with a side order of fun, thanks again Keith. We later went to the national gallery of Ireland and drew a picture of our memorable experiences from our little city break My daughter has also called her gift shop bought leprechaun Keith   Cheers guys You feel a little strange at first getting onto a really old vehicle and being handed a Viking helmet. But I was surprised with how good this was! The tour guide was super energetic and gave us lovely random facts about Dublin as well as some personal opinions of his own. I personally loved the banter and picking on various nationalities on board. I hope no one else took offence. Would definitely recommend! I cannot possibly recommend this tour highly enough!  Our guide, whose name I think is Vinny, had so many great stories and was absolutely hilarious. What a pro! It was just a ton of fun, and very reasonably priced. If you dont like laughing dont do it! It is a funny city trip with a lot of explanations and stories. Our guide, Paul,  gave us a lot of recommendations, too. He asked everybody where they came from (he even knew about our little country, Luxembourg, so plus points for that Paul!) and interacted with us throughout the tour. We were only 3 and half days in Dublin and due to this tour we were able to see another beautiful part of Dublin. I recommend this tour. Buy your ticket in advance, it is well booked. PS: Paul, bus driver would have been too boring for you. You wouldnt have been able mock people there 1,2,3 ROOOAAAR Such a great way for locals and visitors to explore Dublin with some great laughs thrown in for good measure! Vinny was our tour guide and the craic was mighty. Brilliant!! Just Brilliant. Even though our duck broke down, it was dealt with promptly and professionally by our fabulous guide. Kind of added to the experience! Our guide was top class. So funny. Well worth booking. Would do it again in a heartbeat. Our Viking tour guide was a hella funny, bearded dude...forgot the name. But yeah, chill worthy, for sure. A must-do experience when visiting Dublin. I loved having a high-energy and enthusiastic guide take us around the city and sharing their vast knowledge of history, language, and culture. The tour starts and ends right by Stephen s Green so it is super central and easy to find and get to. The tour took about 90 minutes and I was highly entertained the entire time. Definitely bring some warm clothing because it can get a bit chilly on a day when there is some wind. Our guide really made this an awesome experience. He had us laughing every minute, and we loved having so many buildings pointed out to us so that we could learn about their history and architectural style. I also loved getting so much insight to words and turns of phrase that entered the Irish and English languages from the Vikings. I really cannot praise this highly enough. Eoghan was dressed the part and overall great craic. My son really enjoyed the tour and especially the water part. Now to address some negative points Ive seen here - The reason the water part consists of a tour of the Grand Canal Basin and not the Liffey is for safety. Not issues from the water as such but it leaves everyone in the boat open to projectiles of all types from assholes on every bridge they go under as well as the promenade. The tour of the basin is informative and shows a lot. - The tour isnt a historical tour as such so it not as detailed as it could be as its more of an experience. There were a lot of children on our tour including my son and long winded deep dives into Viking history would have been too much. I think they got the right balance of history, humour and banter. - Being stuck beside or behind a bus with the fumes is unpleasant but not the tours fault. - Would recommend. How to review this trip ....  you cant its utter nuts in a great way whilst seeing the city and getting some factual information Cant believe I live in the area and left it this long to do. Best afternoon Ive had in a while Decided to book a tour after we saw one underway during our first day in Dublin. Fantastic experience, our driver Vinny made this one of the best things we did while in Dublin. Would highly recommend, ask for Vinny and you ll have a blast! Excellent tour - great way to get a quick tour of Dublin while having so much fun at the same time! Well worth it! Our tour guide Ken was brilliant! Excellent tour. Kens great craic - just the right amount of Viking, Dublin, Norman and U2 knowledge to keep everyone happy. Remember to lubricate your throat before you go, and get ready to roar, sing, and laugh your way around Dublin. Outstanding!! Would highly recommend. Keith was very knowledgeable and had me in stitches. Hes comedy gold. Give him a raise. Loved it from start to finish A fantastically fun way to tour Dublin. The guide was brilliant, very informativeand engaging. I would highly recommend it to anyone who isnt afraid of being a bit silly and laughing a lot."
207,Vintage Tea Trips,4.95,"I loved it! We sat on the top deck right behind the VIP seats. There are 4 VIP seats. Two on each side of the bus. All four seats face the direction that the bus is traveling. The seats we had were one forward facing and one facing the back of the bus. Not bad seats at all! We could see everything. The food was good. You could have unlimited drinks but of course you have to be conscious of the fact that there is no bathroom on the bus. They provide a booklet with details of the sights you see. Everyone was friendly. It was a good time! I am very satisfied. The staff were very cheerful, helpful and showed excellent hospitality. The food was delicious, especially the hot scones, which were great value. I was also pleased to be able to take a tumbler of drinks home. I would highly recommend this tour to any tourist as it is a great way to see all the sights of Dublin city at once. Took my mother and 2 aunts on this on our last day in Dublin. Not only was all of the food seriously delicious but the whole staff incredibly friendly. The narrator was funny and entertaining and the bus itself decorated so fun and charmingly. All 4 of us highly recommend this tea and want to give a big shoutout Daniel, Liam and team. If youre looking to do an afternoon tea in Dublin thats also entertaining, do this! You also get to keep your take away cup, bonus! We had the VIP seats which gives the best view. The vintage tea bus was an absolute delight! I went with my mom and sister and we really enjoyed our time. It is a great way to see some of the main attractions in Dublin and learn some history, all while sipping tea! All of the staff were extremely nice and welcoming. Adam did an amazing job with describing the points of interest and keeping things entertaining and fun. If you re traveling to Dublin, I definitely recommend booking a tour with them. Had a fabulous time on the vintage bus tour today. All the team were friendly and helpful,  especially Leah as there had been a slight miscommunication between the office & the team on the bus (office had said the vegetarian & daily free option would be Nutella but on the bus it was vegan cheese - which to a child with sensory issues with an aversion to cheese was a big no-no.  But Leah went downstairs and sorted a Nutella sandwich with no problem,  making our experience ((and the whole of the passengers)) much better I paid extra for my family to sit at the front,  which was definitely worth it,  even though the heating radiator was blasting out due to being an old route master. We did this tour mainly because we have done all the other Dublin tours with different companies and wanted something different, which is exactly what we got and thoroughly enjoyed. My sister & I went on the Vintage Tea Trip today and we had a great time.  Adam, Rachel & Leah were very welcoming, friendly and great fun. They attended to our every need. Adam entertained us with some history and fun facts about Dublin City with added humour. As it was a birthday treat for my sister, she was treated to a special surprise and a sing   along to Happy Birthday    Thank you to each of them AND Paddy our very capable and efficient bus driver. It was a wonderful experience which we intend to repeat. I had the most amazing time. Hannah (Montana) was a great tour guide. I though I knew Dublin inside and out but she managed to teach me things! Tea and food were delicious. Anna and Orla served us with a smile and the advice on how to eat the cream was perfect. Tried this experience on my own but the family and duo next to me looked like they enjoyed themselves as well. 100% would recommend. (Also you get to keep the cups  .) On Friday April 19th we went on Vintage Tea tours Dublin on Kitty. Paddy the driver was graciously offered to take our pictures while waiting to board. We had an amazing time Adam, Daniel and Orlaith were always there to get our drinks refilled and providing entertainment while on our journey through Dublin! The sandwiches and desserts were amazing and we finished with hot scones! I would highly recommend this tour! Book early to get the top floor and the absolute best views! This tour was absolutely fantastic.  The food and drinks were spectacular and the bit of commentary was delightful.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Just be aware that this is a vintage bus and it was made with smaller folks in mind. Being a larger fellow I was a bit cramped but thats not a slight on the company at all, but merely an observation for larger guests. Such a fun way to see the city! Leah, Logan, Hannah and Paddy made this an u forgettable experience! The food was wonderful, and the nonstop tea was definitely a bonus! I could highly highly HIGHLY recommend this tour to anyone coming to Dublin! What a quirky and cute adventure our tea trip was. Loved the fun facts and stories told while we sipped our tea and ate all the scrumptious offerings. Such a fun way to see the city. We brought a toddler along and they even made accommodations for the buggy. Plus you get to keep the cute cups as a souvenir! Loved that we were able to support a woman owned business. This is my 8th trip to Dublin and I ve done most of the touristy things but hadn t done this one but I m very glad I did. It was an absolute legend of a time and we had so, so much fun. I was initially worried about sitting up top but it was much easier than I d anticipated and we got the best views. The tea was delicious and the coronation chicken sandwich was terrific as were the desserts. Now, those scones. Those scones were probably the best I ve ever had (and I ve had a lot) and may ever have again. Hannah told me how good they were and I m a firm believer now. The entire team was wonderful and I would recommend this trip and I will do it again on my subsequent visits. Really fun day out in Dublin. Great afternoon with Vintage team trips. Adam and all the staff on board were super friendly and helpful. The bus itself is very quaint and cosy. Sandwiches were tasty, and the desserts were lovely. We also had plenty of tea/coffee refills. Afternoon tea with a difference I hesitated booking because I worried it would be a mismatch for myself and my fifteen year old son. He stumbled onto the tour at the park and asked to go. The stars aligned and Anna got us on with a last minute booking. It was absolutely fabulous. My son thought it was the highlight of the week long trip in Dublin - snacks and drinks on a double decker bus while we toured the city. If you are a mom of a bottomless teenage son, this is a surprise big win. They even managed extra sandwiches upon request. Were now off to a full dinner (for him) and Im still glowing with how wonderful it was. My heart is so happy! 10/10 star rating!! From the moment we approached the bus, the driver was so kind he offered to take our picture, he told us where to stand for the best shot. Then as our name wore called to get onto the bus as our seats wore pre assigned I thought that was as great touch as ther e was no scurrying or rushing into the bus. Literally from the moment we sat down until it was time to get off we enjoyed every single second, so much so we didn t want the journey to end. The sandwich selection is amazing, the taste is even better and then come the freshly made hot scones delivered around the buss to you in a basket. The cakes wore beautiful too. Unlimited drinks is amazing especially for tea lovers like us   . There wasn t enough all of the staff onboard could do for us, they wore so so welcoming and friendly, they checked up on us as the tour went along to make sure everything was okay for us, to see did we need anymore drinks. The small guided tour part was great too, even though I am from Dublin myself I still learned a lot on the tour which was great. I have to say most surprising and wonderful part was that we wore allowed to keep our little plastic portable cups home with us, I just thought that was a beautiful touch. Over all I couldn t recommend this tour to anyone enough!! It is absolutely brilliant, you certainly won t be disappointed. It s a brilliant aftnoon out for anyone from couples to family s to a mother and daughter it suits all even solo people. BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT. It s a wonderful gift for someone, I will most certainly be going again!! Thank you so so much we had a brilliant time My 15 year old daughter and I really enjoyed our Tea Time. The treats were delish, the team were awesome and our guide, Hannah, made us laugh. This was a casual drive around Dublin on an adorable, vintage double decker bus from the 60s! Very unique and fun experience. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone wanting to get a bite-sized experience of Dublin, on a beautiful vintage bus, eating tea treats and listening to classic music. The tour is semi-guided - leaving room for conversation and just the right amount of witty commentary from the guide. The tea snacks were divine. The service was impeccable. Daniel, Hannah, Leah and Paddy exceeded our expectations! This was an amazing outing. The interior of the bus was so cute - like being in a tea shop and a garden at the same time. The food was scrumptious. My husband and I had a great time. We were in the front VIP seats and the view was great (although it was bit cramped at the knees- if you have bad knees or like alot of room youd be better off at the roomier tables). But that was a minor point. We had a fantastic time!! Highly recommend. A perfect afternoon tea experience! We were very lucky to have a sunny afternoon, but it was the perfect way to get a nice glimpse of the city. The pastries, desserts & drinks were great (free refills). You start & disembarked at a great location central to shopping, great pubs and only a few blocks away from the temple bar area. Dan, Hannah, Aaron, and Dave were delightful hosts. I would highly recommend this for a  I just landed in Dublin & checked into my hotel & it s too early to start drinking & I don t want to eat too much because I want to go out for a hearty Irish dinner, but I need a snack & would like to see a little of the city before I do said things  or just any other reason! Had a great time on the bus, comfortable and airy! The sandwiches were fresh, the pastries were so tasty, carrot cake was my fave and they couldnt ask you enough if you needed anything else. The tour around Dublin was just as delightful. Would go again and would highly recommend for a day out:) thanks to all the girls, Sarah, Selma, Anna and the driver Leo Orla was amazing!!! The service on the tour was brilliant. Everyone was so nice and very prompt with our orders! The tour itself was awesome. The 5th star wasn t included because the gluten free cakes were terrible, they were so dry and weird tasting. The sandwich s were good! I make gluten free treats at home and they don t come out that dry... It was especially disappointing since I had to pay extra. Other than that it was a wonderful experience, and I thank you! When visiting Dublin for my wifes birthday this was high on the list of things to do for us. We are both Vegan and it was so lovely to see they already had a vegan option and it wasnt a case of asking. Our mums also came on the trip with us - my mum is an extremely fussy eater but a quick email asking if they could do plain ham and cheese sandwiches i had a swift reply saying that wouldnt be a problem. The trip was fantastic and all 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed. The food, decoration of the bus and staff were all wonderful. Big shout out to all staff who were professional, friendly and so welcoming. Lovely tour around Dublin, the busses look great, and the food and drink was nice, especially the scones which could have done with more clotted cream though. The girls were very nice and had great facts about Dublin, although they were talking very fast. Very fun and friendly little tour.  A little disappointed not to have had our VIP place but we had been warned 1 week in advance (thank you for taking the time to call us in France).  Its an afternoon tea, not a full meal.  But dont eat too much before coming.  The team is really lovely and the visit, aboard Kitty, went very well.  Thanks again to Dona and Lea (for her first tour) for the little surprise for my partners birthday.  You sing very well Great way to see the city if you want a fun activity in between meals. Learned a lot of fun facts of the city from our guide Adam and didn t spill any tea thanks to the amazing bus driver Robert. Nothing better than warm tea, hot scones, and yummy finger sandwiches. Highly recommended! A very fun, interactive experince. Little bit turbulent, but that just made it more entertaining! At first, there seems a small amount of food, but by the time you finish there is more than enough. It was the first time for Aaron to do the speaking tour part & he absolutely smashed it. Highly encourage people to try this, a very fun way to spent the day out! It was absolutely wonderful and our highlight in Dublin. We recommend this tour to everyone who loves to do things a bit diffrent (far away from hop-on-and-of). The food is delicious (best sweets we had in Ireland!!!), all members of the staff are friendly and helpful and it is spectaculare to see all the faces when Kitty - the Bus - is passing them.   A really relaxed why to have a tour through Dublin, while drinking a cup of tea. The vintage tea trip was fun and amazing experience to see the surroundings of dublin while having a tasty and delicious coffee and cakes at the same time!. The whole crew are so informative, fun, accomodating and well professional and always checking us if we need more drinks and foods, I can say that the whole experience is worth it! Thanks again! My favorite moment in Dublin! A comfortable and warm bus, lively atmosphere, plentiful treats, friendly staff, and an efficient way to explore top city attractions! We opted for the VIP Top Deck Seats at 54 EUR/person for the prime view, though other top deck seats, while equally fantastic, offer more space with a lateral view. Traditional, vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options are on the menu, and drinks are included. The plates are very beautiful! Note: Toilets are not available. Even if it s not directly impacted by the Vintage Tea Trip organisers, I would suggest having a collaboration with a nearby pub/hotel to give tokens for the passengers in order to use the toilets before leaving and when returning. We had to go to a restaurant that was close and to buy a water and it felt quite embarrassing because of the attitude of the owner Absolutely fantastic experience!! Adam, Hannah, Dan, and Mr. Robert were lovely hosts, touring us through the city and keeping us stocked with delicious treats and tasty drinks. One of our favorite things we did while visiting and a wonderful introduction to Dublin, could not recommend enough <3 Really nice experience - our guide Anna was full of funny stories about interesting places we passed. There were plenty of good tea, coffee, water and very nice scones, cakes and sandwiches. Our trip was absolutely wonderful. We booked the Vintage Tea Tiur on the last day of our honeymoon and it was such a great experience. The staff ( Daniel, Sara, Leah, and liam) were great. The food was delicious and the commentary about the sights was just the right amount t of informative and humorous. I highly recommend this tour as part if your Dublin stay. Enjoy some great tea and treats on an adorable vintage dou le decker bus! Had such a lovely time. Took my mom for a belated Mother s Day tour. Tea was way better than I expected for a tourist attraction. Daniel the guide was funny and kind and not too over the top, so as to distract from your visit. Provided just enough entertainment to teach you a thing or two, but not too much to interrupt your tea. Layla the server was also great, as was our driver Liam. Make sure to bring some cash so you can give some bucks for their beer fund, as you can t do so via card. I did this tour on the afternoon of Mar 9 and WOW! What a super cute, fun experience. The food was EXCELLENT, I was full and even had some to go. Anna, Sara, Orla and Robert were all so great at making sure each guest was satisfied. Highly recommend! Husband and I took this tour and it was so much fun! Delicious goodies and beverages, a delightful tour hostess, and terrific service from All. Nadine, Daniel, Rachel and Leo are the best, we highly recommend this experience!! The trip was so lovely and enjoyable. The team (Adam, Dan, Dev & Liam) and their enthusiastic interaction makes the one hour journey ends in a flash of time. Moreover the food served was very delicious. I loved all the desserts and sandwiches without any exception. I came with my mom ( who is picky about food) and a friend who also surprisingly enjoyed both the food and journey. It was worth coming even though it was expensive. Regarding the seating arrangement- if you prefer the top deck front seats then you should book VIP tickets. The standard booking get arranged in a way from top to bottom based on the booking sequence- first booked first served. Overall satisfied with this lovely journey. Must try at least once for a variety experience when visiting Dublin. Fantastic experience on the vintage tea trip. We had a birthday party on the bus and was such a cool surprise by the staff on board. A million thanks to Daniel, Aaron, Hogan and Leo they were absolutely friendly and amazing. The trip itself is wonderful, joyful and the food on board is absolutely gorgeous and delicious. Highly recommended if want to celebrate special occasion with your loved ones for an exceptional experience. My only request would be to drive via the IFSC/Custom house square part of Dublin too showing the Samuel Beckett (Harp)  bridge which is a highlight of Dublin :) Thank you again :) Super cute tour with great tea and really friendly nice staff. They offered lots of options for dietary restrictions! My only recommendation would be making it a little longer, and potentially a bathroom break and medication for those who get a little motion, sickness, or the ability to sit on the bottom of the bus if that s your situation! What a fun way to spend some time! Anna was very informative & had a great sense of humour. I had booked early, & VIP, so I was fortunate to have a front seat in the upper deck. Absolutely worth it! I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience, & learned a few fun facts from Anna. The little sandwiches, scone & sweets were all nicely presented, & a good selection of beverages was offered. Thank you Vintage Tea, it was awesome, the whole crew was fantastic! Highly recommend! Really nice experience, the bus was clean and in great shape, the attendants were friendly and took great care of us. I thought tea & biscuits, and while that was true there was also sandwiches, scones, coffee and hot chocolate offered. I would do this again, was great to drive around town and enjoy the architecture and Phoenix Park."
208,Walking Dublin Tours,4.714285714285714,"We had an amazing view hours with Brendan and Maurice. From booking to the tour itself, the whole experience was very personal. I wanted something different than the usual Dublin tour for myself and a group of friends who were visiting. Ive lived in Ireland for a while now and was keen to learn more about the literary characters and the politics of Ireland and its history. I learned a lot. Maurice has a lot of information to hand and knows just about everything on the history of the city. There are several options for tours on the website and we did the Tribes, Scribes and Bribes but Brendan will organise a bespoke tour if there is something specific you want to learn about. This shows a different side of the city away from all the crowds and doesnt just focus on all the usual tourist spots. Absolutely brilliant. Booked a private tour for some visiting American friends and myself. Very good communication by email and the tour was totally customised for our requirements. As a Dubliner I wasnt expecting to learn much but Brendan was a fountain of fascinating knowledge and brought everything to life for us. I would highly recommend his services as a tour guide. Brilliant history nan nan nan nan"
209,Walking Food Tours - (Dublin),5.0,"We did the Pub Tour with Kevin and had a great time! His local knowledge is awesome. Each of the pubs we visited had distinct qualities and were special places to visit. One of the top highlights of our trip to Dublin. Thank you for a memorable afternoon!! WOW! What a fantastic tour! It was so much more than a food tour. Our guide, Kevin, provided a ton of information about the citys architecture, history, and local stories. Even though Ive lived in Dublin and visited countless times since, I still learned so much. The food spots were fantastic and I loved how people were provided suggestions but could make decisions based on their preferences or whatever caught their eye that day too. Talk about a sustainable, interactive, and engaging way to explore the city. Thank you for a great experience! We had the best day with our guide Kevin.. and the food was fab. The extra added touch of Kevin s history knowledge of Dublin along the way was brill. he also does a bar tour too at the weekends!!! Did a walking food tour with Kevin in June of 2024 and couldnt recommend with any higher praise. We do food tours virtually everywhere we travel and this one was one of the best - appreciated his education and history lessons as we wandered around the less touristy parts of dublin and his endless recommendations customized to each and everyone of us. First food tour wed been on where you did NOT have the food included - not only ended up being way cheaper (even after we ordered everything and then some) but allowed us to customize to our wishes without having to make any effort. For anyone looking for a fun food tour in Dublin, look no further Honestly Kevin and his tour was our groups favorite highlight of Dublin. Kevin is an absolute gem we wanted to stay with him all day so we liked it so much we followed him on the bar tour. His passion and love shines through while talking and guiding us through street food. Our fave was the fish and chips. Book early in your trip because he has so much knowledge and recommendations for every part of the city. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Kevin has great enthusiasm, is very fun to be around, engages with everyone and knows his stuff! Besides sharing all of the spots you have to go to (did a food and a drinking tour with him on different days) he s also very willing to help you in other aspects on your visit to Dublin. He is so kind and encourages people to contact him for any activity, transportation, directions, etc. that you may need throughout your visit.  That is always a nice feeling when your visiting somewhere new. I also got to meet his wife at the Food Tour and she was an absolute sweetheart, she is also very helpful and looked into recommending an Indian restaurant I wanted to check out in the area. 200% recommend! Enjoy! We had a fantastic time on this food tour. Kevin and Tracy treated us like family. We loved that food was not included as we were able to customize what we wanted to eat at each stop. Kevin s enthusiasm and hospitality was incredibly welcoming. The history he provided was fascinating and added so much to the over all experience. This was a 10 out of 10 experience. If you re in Dublin it s a must or you will be missing out on a fantastic day! I took the 3 hour walking talking food tour with Kevin on Saturday 08 June 2024. We started with breakfast at a modern indoor/outdoor Cafe right at the Guinness Brewery area of Dublin. From the start, Kevin gave great depth of knowledge, tremendous insight into the origins of Irish food and food culture. Highly entertaining, highly informative, highly enjoyable. After breakfast, we wandered the streets to 4 further locations for lunch, dinner dessert and dessert. While all the food we had was small to medium sized portions, everyone was well and truly satisfied by the time the tour ended. Kevin also gave great recommendations on selections at each stop. There was a person who needed gluten free choices, and a vegetarian in our group. Both were able to choose options at every stop and missed out on nothing. Some of the foods I enjoyed were * Sausage Roll (Pear & Black Pudding) & Barista Coffee * Spicy Beef, Jalapeno, Cheese Toastie * Traditional Fish and Chips * Baileys Cheesecake * Irish Ice Cream (I had 2 flavours: Sea Salt & Chocolate Whiskey) Thanks Kevin, everywhere we great! Kevin is awesome!! An amazing tour with lots of history, good laughs, and delicious food. He was very helpful, kind, outgoing, and friendly. He was very helpful offering tips on how to navigate public transportation, different food or bar spots to visit, places to visit outside the city, and other activities to attend while we were in Dublin! Very highly recommend! Kevin was an awesome tour guide. Its more than a food tour you also get to know a lot about Dublin and Ireland. Kevin had great stories and was kind and professional. You get to try a variety of food representing Ireland both savory and sweet. Highly recommend this tour for your trip to Dublin. Kevin was an excellent guide! We had a great time walking, learning, and eating. Come hungry! This model of food touring was cool because you got to order at each location what you wanted and we were given recommendations too. Definitely a good time :) Loads of fun! Our tour guide, Tracey, was kind, hilarious and an overall delight to be around. We had such a great time listening to her stories about the neighbourhood and the foods she recommended were all delicious. I went on this tour early on my trip to Dublin and Im so, so glad I went, especially since Tracey provided recommendations on what to do later on in Dublin. My girlfriend and I went on the drinks tour on February 23rd, 2024. Honestly we expected a touristy experience but instead got a proper Irish drinks tour and absolutely loved it. Note that this tour is not a get blasted drunk pub crawl and it shouldnt be taken that way. Kevin the tour guide is an absolute legend and seriously knows his stuff. He is one of the many reasons why we loved our experience in Ireland so much and I cant praise him enough. We wish him, his wife, and soon to be born baby the absolute best. - John & Rowan 10/10 recommended. An exceptional guide for 2 exciting visits! Thank you again Kevin for introducing us to Dublin through its culinary specialties and its typical pubs (and drinks). If we had only had to do 2 visits to really discover Dublin, it would have been the  Food on foot tour  and the  Drink on foot tour !!! A must-have that we highly recommend  ! Kevin was our guide. He was both knowledgeable in Ireland history as well as Irish food and food in general. He also had a delightful sense of humor and took time to speak with all of us on this walking tour. I highly recommend taking this tour. Kevin was a fantastic guide! He is fun, friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, and created such a fun atmosphere on the tour. He showed us multiple spots in Dublin that you ll never find as a tourist and these pubs showed us different aspects of Irish culture and history. Highly recommend! I went on this tour with my son (25) while Dad did his own thing. Best choice we made! We had an EXCELLENT guide and I really wish I remembered his name (Steve?) I hadnt expected the tour to include a history lesson but was pleasantly surprised not only to gain the knowledge but to have it delivered in such an enjoyable manner. Thank you for truly making this an experience to remember!! I like how the tour allows you to make your own food choices rather than a set menu.   We enjoyed a breakfast spot, a lunch spot and a couple of desserts.   Definitely take the suggestion to split the food offerings with a friend! Well, maybe all except the ice cream! ;-) Kevin s tour was great. He wanted us to get to know Dublin s street food and he s obviously very knowledgable about the subject and of the local area. If you fancy going on this food tour I d recommend doing it at the start of the trip because he can give you some tips and recommendations on where to go for the rest of your time based on your preferences. My wife and I took part in Kevin s drinks tour and had an amazing time. He took us to 4 unique and different bars that really got us to experience the culture here in Dublin. I cannot recommend this enough for anyone visiting the city. Kevin also provided us a lot of great suggestions for places to eat and see that helped us plan the rest of our time in the city. We did this our very first day in Dublin (and it just happened to be our first day in Ireland as well) and we re so glad we did. Coming off a flight and jet lag, some brisk walking in the cool weather (it was March when we went) and eating some awesome food (breakfast white sausage rolls with bacon and ballymaloe jam, fish and chips) is exactly what you need to start getting settled in. Kevin is an awesome guide, not just for food but for culture and drink as well. His energy and enthusiasm for the city and all it has to offer is infectious and we spent the rest of the day popping into bars like the Brazen Head, the Cobblestone pub, the Church, the Giddy Dolphin , and off the course the Guinness storehouse. So if you love food, and want to know where to spend two to three days eating and drinking well in Dublin, take this tour. You won t regret it. We did both the Food tour and the Drinking Tour.  We were so happy it exceeded our expectations.  Kevin was our tour guide and all his suggestions were spot on.  He is pleasant and knowledgeable.  He is like having a friend in Ireland that gives you the inside tips.   We highly suggest doing both tours, you won t be disappointed.   There was no pressure to purchase anything.   Book it ! Kevin was awesome! He shared a lot of interesting, local facts/history/culture of the area while also taking us to delicious food spots. This tour was not only about food, but getting to know Dublin more as a whole. Kevin also was very personable and gave great recommendations, showing us street food/day to day spots rather than simply walking us around and showing us the most popular/expensive places. Would absolutely recommend Kevin provided a great experience. Excellent commentary about sites and history as we made our way along, and the food stops were very local, authentic and tasty. My partner and I joined Kevins food walking tour in mid November with little to no expectation. We were immediately welcomed by Kevins kind face and friendly demeanor. He took us as part of a group of 12 through the Liberties and the newer parts of the city. Equal parts street food and Dublin history, Kevin took us to 5 stops. At each he provided ample recommendations and instructions on what to order, sharing his favorites and helping us maintain a sustainable eating pace. Having worked at Guinness for many years, Kevin gave us great insight into Irelands most famous product, and frankly we learned more about Guinness from him than from their own brewery tour. With so many added recommendations for dining and touring alike, our only regret is that we didnt do this tour on our first day. It would have been the perfect welcome to Dublin and set us up to seek out even more local and authentic experiences. A heartfelt thank you to Kevin, one of our favorite tour guides ever! This was a great tour. Not only did we have delicious street food but we also learnt a lot about Irish history and culture. I highly recommend doing this tour early on as Kevin gives great recommendations on hidden gems in Dublin - places to see, where to eat etc. Do this on your first day in Dublin! Kevin was entertaining, informative and full of advice and recommendations for what to do in Dublin. The food selections were great, different, tasty and authentically Irish! Being able to buy what you wanted meant you didnt have to over eat or over pay. Highly recommended! We had the best time on this walking tour, even though it rained through part of it! Our guide, Kevin, was very informative, not only about the local food, but about history and he tied it all in very well. He is also very entertaining, we were delighted with the entire tour. We especially loved that fact that he taught us about Ballymaloe Relish! It is indeed delicious and we bought some at the airport on our way out to give to friends. #BallyMaloeRelish #BallyMaloe #BallyMaloeFood, you really need to make Kevin a spokesperson! The food on the tour was so delicious and we had to purchase it but it was not very expensive at all and honestly, it was more than we could eat. If you go with a group, you could feed 4 persons on one serving and I am not exaggerating! It was all so good, we went back the next day for more. You really need to take this tour, you will get more history than a tour without the delicious food so why not? We did the walking food tour with Kevin on our last day in Dublin and are so glad we did! Kevin s sense of humor, knowledge of Irish history/current happenings, and food recommendations made this an incredibly worthwhile experience. His recommendations extended far beyond the five tour stops with music and pubs we enjoyed for our last night! If you d like casual - yet delicious - food, to learn more about the history or Ireland, and explore the city like a local might, book this tour. You will not regret the time you spend learning from Kevin! We had such a great time on this tour! Kevin our guide was really knowledgeable about Dublin and gave loads of recommendations for places to eat and things to do. The food was delicious at every stop too. You choose your own food but Kevin recommends a choice so its the best of both worlds. There are some sit down stops along the way so its not too strenuous, but the walking helps to not feel too full either. Thoroughly recommend! I did the Food on Foot tour as part of the Dublin Pass, and it was the best part of the Pass. Booking via email was painless, and Kevin was the guide. He did a fantastic job of telling some of Ireland s history (such as the Proclamation of the Irish Republic) in between food stops, of which there were five -  breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and dessert . The actual food is not covered by the tour fee, but none of it is expensive, and it s entirely your choice what and how much to buy. Even though it never stopped raining the entire duration, I had a good time. The walking food tour of Dublin was fabulous - Dublin s history came alive as we walked thru the streets and the way Kevin weaved the history of Dublin into the food we ate was wonderful - 5 stops which is plenty - on food tours u can often can feel full after a couple of stops - but this was just the right amount of food - we tasted the street food of the locals - breakfast, lunch and dinner with two stops for dessert - the baileys cheesecake was to die for !!! - highly recommend this tour - Kevin s enthusiasm and sense of humour was infectious - he also had lots of recommendations for pubs, local music, restaurants and anything irish  - 10/10. What a wonderful experience. Kevin and Aoife were simply brilliant guides and extremely friendly - always happy to answer questions and very informative. We can definitely recommend this as a to do when visiting Dublin. Will have to go back one day to try the best baileys cheesecake ;) Kevin was fabulous!! We learned so much and had some amazing food! Do this tour at the beginning of your trip and he will give you ideas for the rest of your vacation. DON T LOOK FURTHER. THIS IS IT! The best Tour and Tour Guide on the planet. Thank you Kevin for what definitely was the highlight of our Trip!! Keep spreading that enthusiasm and positivity. Much love from Germany and good luck with the upcoming big changes! Cheers! Max, Lukas and Mario. We went on the Bar Tour during our vacation. I highly recommend this tour. The locations were fantastic, and our guide (Kevin, in our case) was great. Have a chat with him and ask plenty of questions for an even better experience. We also tried one of his food recommendations afterwards and didnt regret it. be aware that no food is included in the price of the tour. (food is quiet cheap, you can share at each place so it wont be to expensive by the end) the tour was really nice, the guide is amazing and shares a lot about the city and life in dublin. the places youll eat at are really great. highly recommend the breakfast and lunch place. perfect to discover the city, its history and the ambiance. Absolutely loved this tour! 10/10 would recommend. The tour guide (Kevin) offers a locals perspective to street food around old Dublin. We encountered no other tour groups while on our journey, so you know it truly was a locals perspective. Between stops you receive stories and tips for making the most of your visit to Ireland. I would recommend making this one of your first tours, because he offers so much insight on how to authentically see this country. I only wish I had more time here to visit all the recommendations Kevin made! If you are touring on a weekend, be sure to book in advance. Cheers! I wanted to take Kevin home with me!  The most lovely and Irish proud man on the island.  He s not just knowledgeable but gives genuine history.  You ll leave as friends with the know how to get best food Ireland has to offer. Kevin was an excellent guide with tonnes of knowledge which he was happy to share! Really enjoyed his personal view on a tour of Dublin bars and beers. Had an absolute fantastic time with Kevin on this walking food tour. His knowledge and passion for the city of Dublin was amazing to witness and I learnt so much. His suggestions for things to do and to eat were spot on for us during our time in Dublin. Would thoroughly recommend this tour."
210,Waterfall Iveagh Gardens,4.425,"Is a wonderful and very quiet place. Dublin doesnt have ugly parks. They are all amazing! Big oasis fan...or in this case waterfall! What better way to get lost in the city than to find a secluded spot in the centre of the city. Watch the water fall and listen to it. So good for the soul. Gardens have so much on offer too. Beautiful stunning park especially when the weather is nice and sunny and hot. This waterfall looks amazing in person and the whole park is just gorgeous. In the summer months the many grass areas are full of people enjoying the sunshine. Their is also a football pitch just to the right as you enter the park from the Harcourt Street side. I highly recommend to all people to have a walk around this park especially people on vacation. Its just a stones throw away from Saint Stevens green park. The park was pretty, the waterfall is fake lol, so it doesn t have to be on when you arrive. Not really special, but nice piece of greenery and it s not too crowded. 4/5 Another must-see place in Dublin. Many benches are available. This park is very well maintained which makes it even more pleasant. It is also very calm and relaxing, you want to stay there all day reading or lying on the grass. Idyllic Tranquility: Iveagh Gardens and the Waterfall One of my favourite place to photograph waterfalls <3 The Iveagh Gardens in Dublin, with its hidden gem of a waterfall, is a place of pure enchantment and natural beauty. This serene haven, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city, offers a blissful escape where visitors can immerse themselves in the soothing sounds of cascading water and surround themselves with the allure of lush greenery. The highlight of the Iveagh Gardens is undoubtedly the picturesque waterfall. As you approach the cascading waters, youre greeted by a mesmerizing sight and the delightful sound of natures symphony. The waterfall, with its gentle flow and tranquil ambiance, creates a sense of serenity that instantly transports you to a state of calm and tranquility. Sweet little garden in the middle of the city Close by coffee shops Pret managers has bathrooms that was very helpful Visited on Weekend Great place to spend time Love the park as it felt like separate yourself from the city. Really nice thing to see in the middle of a city, couldnt believe how loud it was. Great little park but be aware that the waterfall has no water in winter Calm and peaceful garden with a one of a kind waterfall. Great relaxing place! Mashallah a very good waterfall. I expected a tall waterfall. Tall like a titan but my brothers it was a big hmm a tasty waterfall. Very good picture you can take. Vallah Garantie as we say in germany lovely place to rest Couldnt see the waterfalls cuz they were doing some renovations but the garden itself is so surreal...Definitely found one of my fav spots. Waterfalls are so lovely and peaceful but so violent at the same time Lovely  place, could do with more park benchs Great for a break away from the city with a lovely waterfall and garden perfect place for some photo shoots if you want to change your profile picture and do not have time for a 2 day trip. Waterfall and fountains not following Beautiful Park with a stunning waterfall ! The waterfall was powered off at the time I visited the garden. Nevertheless its a beautiful location. Waterfall was out of action (July 22). Area is cordoned off. Almost hidden park that is pure joy to those who like green urban spaces. Beautiful In the middle of the park, there is this beautiful waterfall. Beautiful and peaceful place for a lunch break It s like deactivated At this time no water.... Unique, great location. Gorgeous hidden garden nice place Its central and peacefull Pretty even in winter Beautiful sculpture Waterfall was off lol Couldnt access to it. Lovely place A hidden gem"
211,Weaver Park,4.1,"Nice skate park and playground and green area for kids, skaters, skateboarders, young and old and dogs. Just on Cork street. Nice greenery, trees and wooded area and graffiti ramps. Im truly appalled by what I witnessed today. Someone thought it was perfectly fine to allow their dog to roam freely in a very crowded playground. Predictably, the dog decided to leave a not-so-pleasant surprise right next to the climbing frame while children were using it. Its an absolute disgrace, and we need stricter enforcement of rules regarding NO DOGS in such areas! At the very least, put the dog on a leash. This blatant disregard for the well-being of others is simply shocking. To make matters worse, the owners child started throwing tree bark at other children, which speaks volumes about the example theyre setting for the young ones theyre raising. Its disheartening to see such behavior. Nice open Street style Skate Park, with mini pool, flat ground space. Grindeble ledges. Kids playground Small inner city park that finally gives area children a place to burn off energy. Now the city of Dublin will need to create a Parks & Rec Department to oversee the maintenance of the growing number of parks. Sadly, with cameras in the park teenagers regularly are damaging the park. The Gardai fail to regularly patrol and monitor the park. The city unfortunately appears to have left this park to just fail. The City Council build social housing now around the park on land that once housed community gardens. The other area would have been perfect for a basketball court and a soccer (football) net. Instead the area in the park is no longer safe for families. The locals stay away now because of youth gangs and drugs and alcohol being used openly. It was a welcomed opportunity for such a poor area of the city, but no longer a fun family park. Fun place for the adrenaline heads to meet up and have some fun together love the atmosphere and creativity that happens here on a daily basis Great City park, looks quiet new and well maintained. Installations are built from high quality materials.  The only downside is that there is no swings. Playground is best for children from 2 years +. Nice park, playground for kids, skate park for teenage. These are the pics of how the park looks now. A part of the big climbing frame got removed due to it being burnt in a fire. Lovely park.need more stuff for kids Dangerous afternoon activity are used  fireworks practice with no adults supervion and authorities dont come to check often enough for those times that actually needed. On once occasion even reached to the road and a car nearly hiy by the practice. On other days there are cycle or skateboarding or other similar practice for the theme since the park made for that purposes. Great Park for kids, Nice things to play on, Good slides, and play area. Nice skate park too of youre interested in that, Few parking spaces outside, but not loads, youd find it hard to park on a busy day. Nice area, and safe environment for the kids. Could do with some more stuff inside, but over all, its pretty good. Lovely playground. The kids didnt want to leave. These places change kids Outlook on life. They are worth every penny. Decent but small urban park, has a great playground for the little ones and a nice skate park for anyone who skates - if a bit small. Clearly a big demand for this sort of park based on the numbers using it, Dublin city council really should install more skate parks around the city! I cant understand why they included gravel at the sides of the paths, it only ends up getting all over the concrete where people are trying to skate...would suggest replacing with bigger flower beds, grass or just widening the paths. As the skate park is quite small for the numbers who use it, I would recommend they extend it out by replacing a big empty grass area in the middle (this is wasted space at the moment). They could even increase the size of the kids playground and fence the whole kids area off properly so there is a separate entrance and exit - as its dangerous having so many little kids running between the skate park and the playground, requiring parents to be extra watchful. All in all, great it exists and it was badly needed, but room for improvement! Great city Park for kids and teenagers Small but Good local park. Playground for the little ones is good. If you are a tourist and not from the area I would recommend you head for St Stephens Green as there is more to do there. This is very much a local kids area with a small skateboard section Great Park, amazing playground for the kiddos, love watching the skateboarding only thing I dont like is people not cleaning up after themselves. Please put ur trash in the bins, there needs to be more bins in the park Thoughtfully designed skatepark and playground in the heart of Dublin 8. First corporation park to be constructed in 100 years Great childrens playground. Skate park is very popular and sometimes skaters dominate, but are generally harmless. No shops or toilets in immediate vicinity that Im  aware of Good early morning and during the day up to 5pm. The park is new (opened 2018) with a large embankment slide, a wooden climbing frame designed to look like a row of houses and a smaller climbing frame/slide for toddlers. No swings. Cycle parking. Free on street car parking on Chambers Street. The playground has fence and 2 entrance gates so its fairly safe. There are 5 benches to sit down on. Skateboarding area, about 10 by 15 metres. Usually busy, especially in the afternoon. If your kid is a toddler or a teenager- they will love this park. Great design for the playground for the little ones. Skate park for the older kids. Always clean and looked after I love this park. I use to live in the flats that use to be there. So its a bittersweet feeling when Im there. Great facilities, especially for teenagers who like skating great to see that kind of encouragement. Nice climbing frames for the small ones and a little skate park for the slightly larger ones. Nice park enjoy stopping there only way to/from town. Open for public skate park with basic and medium level ramps, combined with a decent size mostly wooden playground. One wide slide  situated at the little hill there. Great plece if you live nearby! Recently redeveloped and built, nice public park, with huge childrens playing area,with slides, wooden kids houses, and a small skatepark,always full of action! They have different community events and food festivals, that are always fun to attend. Nice meeting place for people from the area, or to chill out with your children & pets! Ok for kids to spend time Good skating area but they removed half of the play areas recently probably because of delinquency.  Its not as fun for my kids anymore as it used to be. Fantastic amenity. Good mix of things for children to do, jungle gym, a tall wooden structure with a slide, two tunnels, ample seating, skating area, good open spaces, a hill with a slide. It really is a good use of space. Bike parking too. Shame about the south east footpath being such a pain for bringing a buggie up that big curb, completely inaccessible for wheelchair users and painful for some with mobility impairments such as arthritis. That looks to be a relatively newly laid bit of concrete too. Confused as to why it doesnt dip to the road for easy access to all. Could be better but its great overall. Wish I had a space like this one close to me where i grew up. A lovely play Park to take my grandchildren if I go before 12.30 in the afternoon. Later in the day a lot of youths gather and take over the playground siting smoking whatever and stop the children having fun. Great Fun but a swing would make it even better. A great place to relax Great little park for kids and skaters. A nice inner city mini park. Theres a popular playground for kids and a cool and eternally busy skate park. More parks like this would be a great way to utilise vacant lots around the city. Not great, not terrible. Good park for a mess about. If youre a serious skater it hasnt got the best mini ramp or decent variety of ledges Nice park for children. Although I went there around 10:00 am during the week and there were 3 classes there. So for the little ones can be a bit overwhelming Love this park and childrens playground it should be more and more places like this in Dublin!! especially that just around area are lots of places which could be a built a playgrounds instead large grass areas are surrounded by a fence and is used as storage for rubbish. Thats just sad. I love this small neighbourhood park and playground. Its a great place for kids to run around. It would be great if it had a bit of shelter for rainy days. Awesome playground for a 6YO. It has a nice green area and a smaller kid park. Ll these apart from the nice skatepark Good small local park with a good playground for kids, a few benches and a small skateboarding area. Could do with a few more plants/trees. In general is well kept. Really great job by Dublin City Council. It is still sort of new, but looking forward to seeing it as the shrubs and tress grow. Great to have a skate park as part of it."
212,Wellington Monument,4.625,"Very impressive monument and great place to relax on the grass in the surrounding are. Just shows that if you put in the work and defeat Napolean, people will dedicate a nice pointy stone to you! Much bigger than I expected so impressive, amidst the large green lawns. The reliefs and information on the monument are interesting, albeit limited. A quick visit is enough but manu people go to chill in the area around. Towering over the landscape of Phoenix Park is this colossal monument to the Duke of Wellington - who was born in Ireland. Tributes to his successful military campaigns adorn the sides, but its the sheer scale of the obelisk which impresses ... its the tallest in Europe at 62 metres, and it dates back to 1861. A large monument which you can climb up onto part of it with a large green space ideal for lounging in the sun in summer Beautiful, clean, well-maintained place.  Many places where you can walk, many things to see.  There is a zoo nearby, which is very large. Its so massive and the cold simplicity of it makes it even more impressive. Its in the middle of a park, do you can just chill there and relax too. A large monument located at the beginning of Phoenix Park in Ireland. The monument is located on a huge green field, when you get closer to the column you begin to feel how big it is, although from a distance it doesn t seem so. A place with a rich history, surrounded by a huge, very well-kept park. To get there, you need to walk a little from the entrance about 5-7 minutes. Phoenix Park in general is an amazing place. It s quiet, beautiful and peaceful. Perfect spot to walk, cycle, hang with people, meet friends, walk with the dogs, bring the kids  it s a place to everyone that enjoys the green and the nature. A magnificent man-made monument. A place still steeped in history, surrounded by a vast, very well-maintained park. You have to walk a little from the entrance to get there, It is always open, don t hesitate to take a tour and discover other monuments and activities :). As far as structures go... its pretty impressive  . And the surrounding park is a nice place to chill on a (rare) sunny day Also... theres a plaque of the Indian War   . Which, as an Indian, was a happy surprise to see. Visited on Weekend First thing you will see when entering the park is this monument that stand tall and beautiful there. If you like to have a picture and alone time early morning is recommended. We rented the Dublin bikes to move around a bit faster then by foot. Nice green lush area to visit. If you here also good to try Dublin Zoo - but no tickets at gate / advance booking mandatory! Nothing much to see here but good photo opportunity in the middle of a nice big urban park A large monument in Phoenix Park. If you are nearby, its worth a quick walk to see it. Otherwise, its just a miniature version of the Washington monument in Washington DC. There is no informational placards about the monument, which is unfortunate, but also is consistent with most other Irish historical sites (that tend to have minimal to no informational signs). Great spot for a stroll and sight see   Im a native of Dublin and I havent been near this monument in donkeys years. Ive really got into photography and its really giving me a new found appreciation for my home town. Well worth a visit if youve never been to Dublin! Big monument situated at the beginning of Big green Park, nice place for walk. Nice monument. We can use this as a landmark to meet our friends when we are new to this park. Stunning, green, beautiful, fresh air,  perfect for run,  walk,  family walk... I like Phoenix Park, i would highly recommend this spot for any person who visit this beautiful Ireland. A Ziggurat that has little relevance to Ireland except perhaps to remind the populace of Britains military might. It commemorates a man who presided over a vanquishing of one empire to assert another. Lets not forget that when Wellington was prime minister, he ensured that the rebuilt houses of Parliament were put next to the Thames so he could escape disorder by boat. Beautiful obelisk.....all sides have a different inscriptions  and sculptures dedicated to Duke of Wellington....pretty impressive but in need of a clean, sadly. This 62 metres high obelisk is a tribute to the Duke of Wellington and is located in Phoenix Park. The obelisk is almost featureless, but between the steps and the obelisk are four bronze plaques cast from cannons captured at Waterloo, three of which have basel relief sculptures of scenes from his career while the fourth has an inscription. Its really not possible to appreciate the sheer size and scale of this monument until to see it in person, stand right beside it. A monumental obelisk for a monumental man. Great spot to lounge or walk around. Beautiful flower beds Great views and a nice place to sit and watch the world go by, can be windy because of the height. Giant monument, very hard to miss. If its a sunny day its nice to go and climb on top of the first level, you may need some help though as the first step is around 6ft. Beautiful veiws all around and close to the pond. A quick walk from Dublin Zoo. Very tall monument founded in 1861 Big concrete pillar, fun to sit on, grass is cool too Beautiful view over Wexford bay, and many other spots below, including castle. This rather unattractive obelisk was originally intended as the centrepiece for Merrion Square. Thankfully it was put out here in the Park as the locals near Merrion neither wanted it nor were they willing to pay for it. Named for Arthur Wesley, Duke of Wellington and English commander at Waterloo, the monument is a tribute to a man who denied his Irishness. The Hapenny Bridge is also named after him but nobody ever utters his name with that one. Like all obelisks, it serves no purpose but many young people make attempts to climb up bits of it. It is something to look at when driving by or a focal point for somebody lost in the Park A wonderful place for a short rest at Phoenix Park. Its sometimes overcrowded and a little dirty but they clean it up every day. If youve a good timing you can meet up with the deers of the park. Will Danaher at the Wellington monument in the phoenix park great place for walking and beautiful scenery Always make this part of our zoo visit just wonderful So huge in the real life Gorgeous and large park. You could walk here for hours easily. Very clean and safe. Would be a good place to jog or play frisbee. The monument is also cool. I used the hop and go bus to get there and wasn t disappointed. a nice place for a stroll with friends or family, very green and the obelix is a very grand and impressive view Amazing Duke of Wellington memorial - Really nice walk with the appropriate amount of Drama attached.  Would be lovely for a picnic in summer. Great view and atmosphere, green is everywhere I met my love by the gas works wall, Dreamed a dream by the old canal. I kissed my girl by the factory wall, Dirty old town, Dirty old town Phoenix park, Wellington monument, Monday, 8th of May 2017 It was a beautiful park . Had lunch from Subway right up the street and went to the monument! Very beautiful and above all very large English-style park. I regret not having visited it by bike. I recommend visiting the nearby zoo. Majestic monument in middle of green park, very calm place to a busy Dublin, best getaway from work and busyness"
213,White Rabbit Cafe,4.2,"Theres this really cool little coffee shop on a busy street, right near the National Art Gallery and Trinity. Its got a really nostalgic feel to it, and the staff is super friendly. I had the tomato soup yesterday and WoW, what a fresh wholesome and amazing homemade soup! Couple that with friendly staff and a lovely vibe and atmosphere and a dedication to good food and service and you have a winner! This White Rabbit is one happy bunny! I visited in November 2023, having a flat white and chocolate cookie. The coffee was well roasted and made. The cookie rich and balanced. Service was warm, friendly and inviting. I would recommend and return. The food here is excellent and Sasha and all the staff are so kind and friendly. Highly recommend. Lovely flat white, friendly service. Great for quick access to museums. Lovely local cafe in centre of city. Food is fresh and prepared on site. Great coffee, value, and the staff were really lovely and friendly. Their pastries and sandwiches are especially tasty. Thanks again for all the information guys! Will be back soon! Great healthy salad options. Vegan/vegetarian friendly. 2 small tables outside Lovely central spot just behind Trinity. As an Italian, I usually struggle to find a good espresso at a reasonable price (mostly in the city centre) but the barista Sasha really blew me away with a lovely italian style macchiato! Food is as fresh as it gets, offer is quite wide (express salads and bowls, sandwiches, soups) I myself had a tuna sandwich and chicken soup, both were absolutely superlative!! Highly recommended, definitely adding this to my list of favourites! Lovely cafe with the most friendly staff! Highly recommend Definitely a favourite! Food Its on my way to office so thought of getting a latte, the lady barista made this art in everyone s coffee, i was looking forward to be having same experience, but alas when it came to me she was so done , and handed the coffee not even polite there you go, no art in coffee nothing. I wanted to give her benefit of doubt and went back next day, same behaviour, the only difference b/w me and other ppl was my color . Shame of the barista! If it was indeed intentional its sad. Never went back again. Petit Cafe is much better , i would recommend that Just paid EUR3.50 for a croissant so old, even ripping it apart to toast it to get some freshness back into it, didnt help. Ive walked past here 1000 times, always wanting to go in because it seems really cosy and popular. So disappointed and will not be visiting again. Best chai latte of my life. My friend described the flat white as  average . Salad was good. Customer service was mediocre along with toasty sandwich. Our table was not cleaned after previous customers. Also, the seating was uncomfortable and the pillows looked very dirty (crumbs etc.). Would return for the chai and the nice vibes, however. Nice little cafe with friendly staff and comfortable feel. I absolutely love this cafe, always come in for a flat white and toastie, and both never fail me. The affordable prices, which are hard to come across in town nowadays, and the kind and welcoming staff makes this cafe one of my favourites! Really disappointed. I always went for the food not the service. This is why I won t be back. Today I went in & took my place in the queue of two others. Premises were empty, no bums in seats. Lady at the till chatting away with a friend while I m waiting,  she decided to tell me she had not seen her friend in ages, & continues to chat. Ok. I step back & he apologizes for delaying me. This happens twice..! Since when is a chat with a friend (who should take a seat or come back) take the place of a polite but also paying customer. It s lunch time, Iv politely waited & now I m just being ignored, while the chat continues!!! This is not the first time either. Bad service is the death of most businesses. Sadly, Really bad customer service. Don t waste your time going. Really nice to see somewhere in Dublin with good food at reasonable prices. Our whole office can been seen here at lunch time for the take away soup and sandwich. Staff are always nice, (I think Gabriella) is always super friendly and knows most regulars orders off by heart. Keep meaning to pop in for a glass of wine in the evening! Amazing food! Soup was absolutely lovely  . BEST COFFEE IN DUBLIN!!! And all the staff were amazing and so kind and a lovely atmosphere! Will vist again! <333 Food It is a shame that there are no zero stars to rate this cafe . After 15 minutes from ordering i was approached by a staff member asking me if I would like to order something else, otherwise I have to leave as it is lunch time 1:00 pm and they will be expecting customers . I have never encountered such rudeness in my life. will never return to this place.  for the fellow customers, beware, to finish  quickly around lunch time or else you have to vacate. This cafe was really nice and the staff were lovely, but I was very put off by hearing the owner/manager (unsure) talking down to his staff. He was quite loudly being hostile and demeaning to the women working there with him, and listening made me very uncomfortable. I hope this can change. Fantastic!  quality of food and exceptional service. What a coffee! Lovely place and also the baristas were amazing, and so kind with us, obviously I ll come back. Overheard manager/boss demeaning and being really condescending to female barista. Barista was lovely and should not have been treated like that. Not impressed with the misogyny with my coffee. Hopefully manager starts treating his staff with the respect they deserve. The prepared sandwiches were tasty and well crafted, I loved them. Also nice service! Will definitely go back when in the area. Lovely little spot for some soup or a sandwich. Service with a smile and some great outdoor seating. Soup was excellent and could have had another. Great little coffee shop in Dublin! Stopped in for a smoked salmon sandwich and a latte. Both were so delicious!! The best latte I ve had in Dublin. Visually appealing presentation, classy cup, and complex coffee flavor. A couple of delicious chaos and a Danish roll were delicious at this cute cafe! Loved this place, the staff and the atmospher. The food was amazing. Really handy for popping in and picking up a pre-made sandwich, and the ones ive had are all tasty and fresh. Good coffee too. Toasties are amazing,  I recommend the one with pesto and veggies, delicious. I like it here cafe is alright staff are very friendly and welcoming service at times is slow but great location for pearse station food is average. Beautiful coffee and most pleasant staff. Love to visit again sometime. This is a hidden gem for a great lunch. Toasties are delicious with the chunky soup. Great, friendly staff too. Wrap was good quality and reasonably priced but they took 16 minutes to toast it, and there was only one other customer there, was a bit bizarre Affordable, for Dublin, quick, super tasty, great staff. Excellent vegan wrap and lovely staff, would highly recommend Amazing toasted sambos & soups . Super quick service and friendly staff. Cant find better value for money Great salad!! I m sure the rest of the food is great as well Absolutely delicious sandwiches and wraps, so so yummy! Lovely break from bustle on Nassau Street. Attentive staff, quiet spot for a conversation."
214,Wolfe Tone Park,3.925,"A popular little square with seating and grassed areas. Theres a cafe in an old tram in the square. Good location to take a break and its close to many of Dublins large shopping centres. Was on a singing walking tour. Nice atmosphere. Coffee and snack hut in a converted tram car. Very urban but a nice place to sit and opt out of the hustle and bustle from the many shops nearby. Well kept little park beside Jervis shopping centre. Nice coffee shop there too. The Tram. The area in some parts   is under a  construction upgrade not sure exactly but it will be finished soon . The is a lovely cafe The Tram which is selling take away fine coffee and tasty food and snacks . There is public toilets with mobility access thats open 7 days a week 10am to 8pm . its spotless , there is security and cleaners on site during opening hours . Big old trees line the sides and solid benches , and old headstones lying on the walled side . its just perfect for welfare break , nice coffee and a tinkle if needed. its very well maintained . Great outdoor place to sit in the city center,  it had the tram cafe and a free seating around it. There is a public toilet as well and all at ground level.  There are usually a lot of people here and also birds/seagulls around waiting to get a bit so not the best place to have a relaxing lunch. There are no shelter for rain and no place for parking but overall a great park in busy city It is difficult to decide how many stars to award as it has been redeveloped a green  public space but as they are waiting for the trees and plants to settle in there is no public access except to the Tram Cafe. It the past I would have liked it except for the fact that it was a magnet for anti-social behaviour. I will give it three stars with a possibility of upgrading to four or five at a later date depending on how well it is managed. Litterally full of addicts and alcoholics that I witnessed on two occasions fighting like something out of homeless Tekken. Then one of the other undesirables set alight to someones shoes and nearly lit the entire park on fire The only place in city that DC set up toilets. Very well maned and very clean and also could have cup of coffee from the tram sitting on bench A nice spot to relax and take the air close to the bustle of Henry St Enough space to sit and eat outside at the heart of Dublin city centre. Great place for selfies for tourist Interesting little spot in the city that stands out from its surroundings. The Tram cafe livens it up a bit but it can look dicey after hours. Thats fine! Lovely place for drink coffee on saturday afternoon with your friends. Location in the city center Nice stopping point at Tram Cafe there. Plus. Public Toilets now there as well. Look up pictures of what it looked like before 2001. Its insane what theyve done to it, even recently the grass was removed for that beige gravel. Insane Great spot just be careful you dont trip over a junkie.... Bekind Theres always something on there! Great location to wait for a friend. There is a Dublin bikes station. Very good coffee from a pleasant and polite barista The Tram cafe has a very friendly staff. Love this tram cafe. Coffee and ice cream is lovely I miss the cow    but nice relax place Really nicely kept, lovely space to read a book in good weather This is a small park at the top of Henry Street. A place to relax and have a bite to eat, local food Very nice public space It was a great experience and amazing place, must go Great food great service Wonderful coffee They are the slowest park builders in the world Fantastic beautiful peaceful The people around and this area dirty, dangerous Beautiful place and beautiful people. Love this Ok Like it Historical site Full of junkies Love Der Park ist ganz nett, allerdings sehr viele komische Leute hier, Alkoholiker, Suchtige etc... , parco piccolo ma molto comodo e carino."
215,World Poverty Stone,4.45,"Impressive lean face people figures made of stone to conmemorate the many victims of the great famine in Ireland. Very close to the EPIC museum which once was the main departure point in Dublin for many people leaving the country in order to escape from a hard life seaking a better future abroad. World poverty stone unveiled in Dublin. ... The United Nations General Assembly adopted 17th October as its International Day for Eradication of Poverty in 1992, and the day is now observed in more than 100 countries to highlight the struggles faced by poor people throughout the world. Stumbled upon this whilst walking. It was a nice little impromptu history lesson of the poverty and famine faced. No complaints. The World Poverty Stone is a commemorative stone to mark International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. The stone, which is situated between the Famine memorial and Sean OCasey Bridge. The stone is also embedded in the pavement and easily missed if youre not looking carefully. Purely from an aesthetic point of view, I wouldnt go out of the way to see it unless youre already going to visit the EPIC exhibition or to see The Famine Memorial. On the stone the following words are inscribed,  Whenever men and women are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are violated. To come together to ensure that these rights are respected is our solemn duty . The sentiments are noble and worthy. A good memorial for the victims of the Irish famine. The views of the river is a plus The sculptures are a memorial work of the Irish people who were forced to emigrate during the famine of the 1800s. I stark reminder of a past that was not too long ago. Human Rights, Poverty, Famine and all beside the River Liffey and the Financial Services Centre of Dublin. Excellent place to visit and ponder....and hopfully act  upon. Another statue in the city. This one tells you about the Great Famine. Views onto the river and thought-provoking memorial. Really nice detailed sculptures Intense and very powerful art True depection of Irish potato famine. Esculturas muito belas, mas que acabam passando desapercebidas por quem passa pelo local, assim como quem passa fome pelas ruas das grandes cidades do mundo... Great. Das Famine Monument in Dublin wurde zum Gedenken an die Grosse Hungersnot in Irland 1845 bis 1852 und weitere Hungersnote, mit uber einer Million Toten errichtet. Es wurde von Rowan Gillespie aus Bronze geschaffen und 1997 errichtet. Das Monument befindet sich in der Nahe des Hafens am Custom-House-Kai, am Ufer der Liffey. Viele Betroffene waren im 19. Jahrhundert zur Auswanderung und damit zur Einschiffung nach Amerika gezwungen. Eine der ersten Gruppen dieser Auswanderer reiste 1846 am St. Patrick s Day mit dem Viermaster Perseverance[1] unter Kapitan William Scott vom Custom-House-Kai ab. Alle 210 Passagiere uberlebten die Reise und kamen am 18. Mai 1846 in New York an. Frente al museo de la emigracion encontramos este conjunto escultorico que recuerda los anos de la gran hambruna del siglo XIX. Atracao turistica de historia interessante Construido per commemorare la grande carestia Irlandese La World Poverty Stone e una pietra commemorativa  che  ricorda la Giornata internazionale delle Nazioni Unite per leliminazione della poverta nel mondo.

Le  sculture situate nei pressi  della pietra commemorativa  sono state  istallate  dal  1997 al 2007  e  ricordano  la  grande  emigrazione  del 19.mo secolo dovuto alla poverta Ver esta escultura te hace sentir en cierto modo lo que se vivio durante la hambruna. Dirljivo je osjetiti preko metala toliko patnje gladi i jada,pozelite ih utjesiti ali njihov izraz lica je kamen jada,nema tu vise sri e Impresionante conjunto escultorico en bronce nan nan nan okay nan Ciekawe miejsce nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan"
216,"laine, my love",4.35,"Nice use of a small space. Really affordable and good portion sizes. Coffee tasted a bit peculiar but overall a really nice cafe. Coffee is delish! Food amazing and good location 2 min walk from Connolly train station .. can t wait to go back! Found this place walking with a friend, we saw a line in this small corner close to the city center and I think  this place must be good  and what a surprise. I ask the cashier for her recommendation - the three cheese sandwich- made with rustic bread and a dry tomato sauce, AMAZING!!! The quality of the service was lovely too, I ll recommend everyone that it s looking for something fast and delicious to give them a chance, I m definitely coming back to taste the rest of the menu. 10/10 It s became my luck spot before class, the mushroom sandwich my absolute fave and lemon and mint tea mix to die for. Obsessed! Finally big portions low price. Everything was delicious and really enjoyed the sun I found this spot while planning for holiday as it was near our hotel. All the photos we saw made us excited for our visit for over 4 months. The wait was WORTH IT! The Breakfast Sambo was by far the best breakfast I had while in Ireland. The employees were all so kind and sincere, this is by far the place I will be recommending to anyone I know that is traveling to Dublin. Very delicious breakfast with coffee in Dublin 1. Perfect way to start the day. Cozy little place with a lovely atmosphere. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and Food was delicious and served quickly. All menu items are well priced. Amazing breakfast! Really tasty great portion! #Supportlocal Great place Bagel with salmon so delicious Food Nice coffee. Customer disservice. Not sure they collectively could be more up themselves, rude or possibly hungover. Get some new staff. Nice looking place . Id like to share my experience at this cafe. The coffee they serve is truly excellent and of high quality, which is definitely a plus. However, Im saddened to say that the customer service leaves much to be desired. On several occasions, Ive noticed that the staff seem to be in a bad mood and are rude in their demeanor. Often, they dont respond when I thank them or even when I simply greet them upon entering. While Ive been a repeat customer at this cafe, I no longer feel comfortable patronizing it due to the consistent negative interactions with the staff. Improving the attitude and courtesy towards customers would greatly enhance the overall experience and encourage customer loyalty. Great coffee. Lovely aesthetic. Wifi didn t work. Couldn t find the network and when it finally showed up, the password didn t work. The people working weren t helpful either. I was looking forward to spending time here to get some work done but had to slam my coffee down and find a different spot. Would recommend this place 10/10 if you don t need wifi. Cafe accross this fantastic place for morning coffee. Enjoyed Hot chocolate. Definitely worth giving a try  . The most aesthetic place in town to start your early morning with. Always new items in menu; Great breakfast / lunch offers; Vegan/Vegetarian options are included; Coffee of a very higher standard; And, yes, the stuff is as good as flat white with brownie. Will recommend this place to everyone, who s having some time on Monday - Friday: 7:30am - 3:00pm. During the lunch hours place is usually super busy, but you can always get a take away! Delicious little spot   had an americano and granola to go. Both absolutely spot on in terms of flavour and presentation too! Weekly visit. Simple and tasty. Amazing soup and best mushroom toast EVER! This was one of the nicer surprises in Dublin so far - went in by the recommendation of the Indy Coffee Guide, and planned to get just coffee and toast. I ended up returning the following morning for breakfast as well. The coffee was not exceptional but well above average, and (quite surprisingly) not overextracted. Food exceeded my expectations in any realm - toasties were crispy and flavorful and croissants had close to perfect lamination. Definitely worth it for a casual breakfast and a chat with very courteous staff. Beautiful coffee shop with amazing food. I had one of the best salads I ve ever had here. Stayed in Dublin for two days and came here on both mornings. So awesome! Delicious breakfast menu and coffee. Good value for money! Friendly staff Good place to grab a coffee. They have a good selection of tasty sandwiches and the staff is super friendly. Chirpy little independent coffee shop selling good selection of breakfasts. They have made the best of their narrow floor space and provided good seating area for groups and solo patrons. The food was good and priced very competitively for Dublin City centre ( 10 for large Irish breakfast and coffee). Whilst there isn t any Wi-Fi, this doesn t seem to be an issue for the majority of people. The coffee was sadly of very average quality. Highly recommended good place for breakfast and price is fair enough Really nice place, bright and theres a good few seats if you dont mind sharing big tables with other people. The staff were really friendly and the coffee is good This cafe is really lovely Quite cheap and great quality coffee It s rather busy during lunch time so you may find it hard to find a seat inside! Overpriced! 8  for a chicken sandwich (chicken leaves and mayo). The bread was nice, but the sandwich was nothing special... The cashier was very fed up. An Overal score of 3 stars, the sandwich did the job. That was all. Delicious pumpkin latte, excellent customer service and great (creative) cakes! They ve even got the pastries halloween-themed! Very good food, lovely atmosphere Fantastic coffee and baked goods. Was reasonably priced and very friendly staff. Would definitely come back! Just had the most gorgeous Avocado on sourdough for breakfast. Absolutely delicious. This is a little gem of a spot. Its a shame that the service is so unpleasant . They receive you with a bad attitude, a bad face, they do not bring service with a good attitude. I have attended and filled out more than 3 loyalty cards in these months because the location is too comfortable for me and the food is quite good. The five young women who work here have a lousy attitude. Disappointing. We found this place with a friend during our stay. During the 4 days we were there, we had our breakfasts there. Cookie, banana bread, porridge, granola, avocado toast, scrambled eggs, bagel, we loved it all. Portion more than correct. In terms of drinks, we only tasted the hot chocolate which was also good. Small place, only a few seats, but I find that that contributes to the charm. Very pleasant and gentle atmosphere. We will definitely return there on our next visits. Coffee is always so good probably my favourite coffee shop in the city Lovely cozy cafe. It s a tiny cafe but the quality of coffee and food is great. Lovely staff also! I enjoyed a large pain au chocolat for  3 here! The soup I got was really gorgeous. However, all the sandwiches were pre-made and had fillings I couldnt eat, like mayo. There were closing while we were in the middle of eating our lunch so I felt rushed to finish and leave. If you could eat what they had on the menu you would probably go back, but I more than likely wouldnt return due to the limited menu Great for a pop-in coffee. Try their three cheese toastie. Hits the spot Lovely creamy coffee. The staff are super nice. Toilet was clean. Got very very busy once 12 hit. There isnt a whole lot of seating. Also, Beware. Their salt dispenser looks like the sugar dispenser. The staff kindly replaced my drink, I think it happens alot. Nice coffee, but the staff are most consistent in their misery, rolling eyes at customers and confrontational at non-issues. You can forgive an isolated rude experience, but its the norm for here. We had breakfast twice at this cute cafe during our stay in Dublin. The coffee was more than decent and I loved their homemade granola with yoghurt and fruit. The almond croissant was also quite good. I was pleasantly surprised with their prices considering the quality and quantity of their food. I really liked the minimalistic design that doesnt sacrifice customers comfort. This would be in my Top 10 for takeaway coffee in Dublin. Whoever the baristas are; they get the mix between coffee richness and smoothness almost perfect! The result is highly palatable cup of joe served up by very affable staff. Highly recommended."
