Initially constructed in the early 13th century under the orders of King John of England, the castle served as a symbol of English rule and authority in Ireland for centuries. Over the years, Dublin Castle underwent numerous transformations, reflecting the shifting dynamics of power and governance in Ireland. Initially designed as a military fortress to protect the Anglo-Norman colony in Dublin, the castle expanded over time to encompass residential quarters, administrative offices, and ceremonial spaces. One of the most notable features of Dublin Castle is its diverse architectural styles, which blend medieval, Georgian, and Victorian influences. The castles State Apartments, constructed during the Georgian era, boast elegant interiors adorned with intricate plasterwork, lavish furnishings, and exquisite artwork. These opulent spaces once housed the British Viceroy and served as the center of colonial administration in Ireland. Beyond its State Apartments, Dublin Castle is home to several other historically significant buildings and attractions. The Chapel Royal, dating back to the 19th century, showcases stunning Gothic Revival architecture and serves as a venue for religious ceremonies and cultural events. The Record Tower, the only surviving medieval tower of the original castle, offers visitors a glimpse into Dublins medieval past. Surrounding the castle is the Dubhlinn Gardens, a tranquil oasis that provides respite from the bustling city streets. These landscaped gardens feature lush greenery, manicured lawns, and historic monuments, creating a serene retreat in the heart of Dublin. Today, Dublin Castle stands as a symbol of Irelands complex history, serving as a testament to the resilience and endurance of its people. While no longer a seat of political power, the castle remains an important cultural landmark and a source of national pride.

We saw giraffes,zebra, sea lions, a variety of monkeys, red pandas, lions, tigers, snow leopards, elephants, birds, penguins, wolves and more. Luckily, all of the animals were out and active on this day. They did start to bring all the animals in around 15:45 especially in the Africa area. Although not bad, they could use some updates here and there. We saw cracked glass on several exhibits and lots of dirty hand prints on the windows.

What really impressed me is this: they called us to tell that the place from where the boat was changed, but because we were distracted by the number format we did not answer and did now know that boat left from another place (river level issues). So, when we got to the kiosk and told the lady we do not see any boat, she explained what happened and proposed us to go on the next tour, 1h later, which was also the last one that day. Good place to eat recommendations too! Very easy going, natural, a good customer orientation and diplomacy.

Did this tour on June 22nd when we were in Dublin for the Artic Monkeys concert(lets not talk about it  ). We were across the river and saw the boats so we did a quick Google and realised we had 5 minutes before a tour started so we RAN! Anyway, best spontaneous thing we did. The guy that sold us the tickets was so friendly and even though we were totally last minute,he made sure we got on and didnt make us feel like a nuisance for not booking ahead or showing up with seconds to spare(I know that was probably annoying because we were chancing it). We had no expectations but this is one of the best things to do in Dublin if youre visiting! Nice way to get a feel of things while relaxing in a boat and also get a really informative but funny history lesson that was really engaging and didnt make me feel like I was back in college getting a lecture   Daire/Darragh(sorry if Ive mispelled) was fantastic!!! So funny and knowledgeable he didnt miss a beat and although Im sure he could do this in his sleep, felt like a very naturally spoken tour instead of robotic like tours can sometimes feel. Mark was also fantastic and I love how he slowly circled the boat at points so we could all see everything! Recommend this 100%! Such a nice experience and being from Cork, Ive been to Dublin a lot and seen all of these sights before, but I definitely learned new things and wasnt bored for a second!

I do have to take the tourguide to task over the Coat of Arms on the Custom House. Yes, the Lion represents England, the Unicorn is Scotland and the Harp for Ireland but the reason Wales isnt represented isnt because its a Principality. Its because Wales originally was captured by the English Crown of Edward I and therefore became part of England. Subsequently, annexed by England in the 16th Century bringing it under English Law.

My son really enjoyed the tour and especially the water part. Now to address some negative points Ive seen here - The reason the water part consists of a tour of the Grand Canal Basin and not the Liffey is for safety. Not issues from the water as such but it leaves everyone in the boat open to projectiles of all types from assholes on every bridge they go under as well as the promenade. The tour of the basin is informative and shows a lot. - The tour isnt a historical tour as such so it not as detailed as it could be as its more of an experience. There were a lot of children on our tour including my son and long winded deep dives into Viking history would have been too much. I think they got the right balance of history, humour and banter. - Being stuck beside or behind a bus with the fumes is unpleasant but not the tours fault. - Would recommend.",10 months ago,2023-09-02 22:56:59.596124,"Thank you so much for your lovely feedback!

Pathways meander through the garden, inviting visitors to explore and discover its beauty from different angles. The garden is also home to several sculptures and art installations, enhancing its aesthetic appeal and providing points of interest for art enthusiasts.

Just had a fantastic experience at the Guinness Storehouse today! The self-guided tour was the perfect mix of informative exhibits and interactive displays, taking me through the rich history and brewing process of this iconic Irish beer. Learning about Arthur Guinnesss vision and the meticulous steps involved in crafting the perfect pint was fascinating. Plus, who can resist the opportunity to pour your own (almost) perfect pint at the end? Lets just say the surge and settle is harder than it looks! But beyond the beer itself, the highlight was the stunning panoramic view of Dublin from the Gravity Bar. Sipping a fresh Guinness while overlooking the city was the perfect way to end the tour. Heres what I loved: Self-guided tour: Freedom to explore at my own pace and focus on the aspects that interested me most. Interactive exhibits: Kept things engaging and fun, especially for visual learners like myself. knowledgeable staff: Ready to answer any questions and share their passion for Guinness. Breathtaking view: The Gravity Bar offered a truly unforgettable vista of Dublin. Overall, I highly recommend the Guinness Storehouse for anyone visiting Dublin.

Rising majestically from the heart of OConnell Street, it symbolizes the citys journey towards a vibrant, forward-thinking future while honoring its rich history and cultural heritage. Designed by British architect Ian Ritchie, the Spire was conceived as part of Dublins Millennium Spire project, a visionary endeavor to create a contemporary landmark for the new millennium. Its slender form, constructed from stainless steel, reaches an impressive height of 120 meters (almost 400 feet), soaring above the bustling streets below. The Spires construction marked a transformative moment for Dublin, replacing the once-iconic Nelsons Pillar, which had stood on the same site until its destruction in 1966. Unlike its predecessor, which celebrated British naval hero Horatio Nelson, the Spire represents a departure from historical associations, embracing a more inclusive and forward-looking vision for the city. Since its unveiling in 2003, the Spire has become an integral part of Dublins urban landscape, captivating residents and visitors alike with its sleek, minimalist design and commanding presence. Its reflective surface catches the sunlight by day, casting ever-changing patterns of light and shadow, while at night, it is illuminated by a dazzling array of LED lights, transforming it into a radiant beacon in the darkness. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Spire serves as a symbol of Dublins resilience, creativity, and cultural diversity. It stands as a testament to the citys ability to embrace change while staying true to its roots, embodying the spirit of innovation and progress that defines Dublin as a global capital. As a cherished landmark and meeting point, the Spire holds a special place in the hearts of Dubliners, serving as a gathering place for celebrations, protests, and moments of reflection. It stands as a reminder of Dublins ongoing transformation and its enduring spirit of resilience, unity, and hope for the future.",a month ago,2024-06-02 22:57:13.017233,,,,0,336,1094,True,,

Maybe it was the time of year (April 2024) but our tour was nothing more than a very cold bus ride listening to a pre-recorded geo-fenced recording. Our first bus had no heat and we all froze.  The recording said that we could go into the library at Trinity College for free, but when we got off the bus at Trinity the guard at the college said there was a per person charge to go in the library. Maybe they hadn t updated their recording.  Our driver seemed unhappy and offered no information over the Microphone.  On a later bus, the driver was more vocal and that made for a better trip.",2 months ago,2024-05-02 22:57:17.453249,"Hi Bill. Were sorry to receive your review. We always recommend the live tours to English speakers, but just to confirm our recorded commentary buses are not geo-fenced but are controlled by the driver. The drivers on multi-lingual buses are not supposed to offer information over the mic as people are listening to their chosen language with headphones. The buses can be cold at times in April, but it is not practical for us to heat open-top buses. The covered area at the front does offer shelter from the elements. We do not advertise that Trinity College is free entry, it has always been pay to enter. The National Library and National Galleries are served by the same stop and are free entry which we do mention. We hope you enjoyed your visit to Dublin otherwise.

My wife and I selected DoDublin based on factors such as positive reviews and pricing. Our tickets were purchased online and we utilized the electronic voucher for boarding which was seamless. The drivers were superb.  They were professional, informative and entertaining. Unfortunately there was an instance where DoDublin really let us down which almost resulted in missing our Kilmainham Gaol tour (which can be a very difficult ticket to get). We waited at one of the stops (#6) for the first bus of the day. We observed the DoDublin bus approaching from stop #5 but it then turned off the designated route, not to be seen again. An email enquiry and complaint to DoDublin was responded to with the following: Unfortunately, we were only alerted that there was a gas leak up by stop 6 and our services were diverted from this area. We were only made aware of this and in turn could not alert customers. Due to this factor being outside of our control and our services till operating, and the ticket being activate, we would not be in the position to refund these tickets. Regards, Jack O Donoghue Commercial Department This was odd as the gas leak was reported in the news at 07:41h and almost two hours later at 09:20h as we stood by stop 6, the road was completely fine. In addition, other tour buses as well as over a dozen local buses drove past our stop along Merrion Road without issue. We eventually got a DoDublin bus 30min later. It is unfortunate that this inconvenience to its customers is apparently of little concern to DoDublin. A gesture of goodwill such as perhaps an extension of the ticket by 4-6 hours would incur no cost to DoDublin. Instead they adopted a stringent company-first position resulting in a much less than satisfied customer.",a month ago,2024-06-02 22:57:17.463473,"Hi Russ Were sorry that you felt so let down by our decision not to refund your ticket on this occasion.

As the lava cooled, contraction occurred. Horizontal contraction fractured in a similar way to drying mud, with the cracks propagating down as the mass cooled, leaving pillarlike structures, which are also fractured horizontally into biscuits. In many cases the horizontal fracture has resulted in a bottom face that is convex while the upper face of the lower segment is concave, producing what are called ball and socket joints. The size of the columns is primarily determined by the speed at which lava from a volcanic eruption cools.[8] The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns seen today. The basalts were originally part of a great volcanic plateau called the Thulean Plateauwhich formed during the Paleocene.[9] #heritageofireland",5 years ago,2019-07-02 22:57:27.883679,,,,1,51,141,True,,

Our tour guide was very nice, but she spent so much time talking and telling stories that we didnt have time to actually see anything. By the end of the 2.5 hours she was stopping on random street corners and pointing to where things were, rather than actually taking us to see them. We only saw 3-4 of the stops listed on the website. An overall very frustrating experience. Updating my response based on my note below: I appreciate your response, Pat. I dont mean to argue. But I do believe I have fair reason to be upset with our experience. Because we did not see half the things you mentioned. I knew what we were supposed to see. But we spent 90 minutes of the 2.5-hour tour inside Dublin Castle, and most of that time was spent standing in one place hearing various stories and histories. Which was not uninteresting -- it just wasnt what we signed up for. We only saw Christ Church from across the street, because we were running low on time. We then did walk through Temple Bar, but our tour guide only pointed to where River Liffey was -- we never saw it or crossed any bridge. So we did not see the OConnell Monument, the post office or anything on the North side of the city. And we never went past the Houses of Parliment or Trinity College. Our last stop on the tour was The Old Storehouse. After that, we were dropped back off at the Tree of Gold statue. I have no doubt these tours are typically great, based on all the positive reviews. And again, our tour guide was very nice. Had I not expected to see all the things you pointed out, I wouldnt have been as disappointed.

You were taken to Dublin Castle, Christ Church Cathedral, the former Viking & Medieval Quarter, Temple Bar, the River Liffey and its bridges, the Historic cafe/bar The Church, Henry Street, OConnell Street,The General Post Office, Daniel OConnell Monument, College Green, the 18th century former Houses of Parliament and the outside of Trinity College. There would have been a number of other little gems along the way. What works for one person may not work for someone else. I understand that. The other folks on the tour showed their appreciation of the tour to the guide at the end even though she didnt look for any gratuities, as is our norm.

You don t do much strenuous walking (each check point was only 5 or so minutes from the last and you stay in the central city area) but do remember you will have to be standing for 2.5 hours (so maybe don t bring any heavy bags). One small potential improvement would be maybe the opportunity for a quick toilet stop (if there are free public toilets in Dublin I don t know?). Obviously we were allowed to leave at any time, but didn t want to miss any of the action by going off on our own to find a toilet, so would be nice to integrate that into the tour in case anyone needs to go.

We were ca. 50 people on a single bus floor with nearly no ventilation and absolutely no air conditioning (during covid pandemic). It was super humid and very hard to breathe with people coughing all around us. What is even worse is that the main actor told us a story over a burning candle while the bus was in motion. I am wondering how no one in this company thought of the aftermaths in case the candle dropped over someone sitting nearby. We would have easily become the story for their next tour. The performance ended right in front of the graveyard, no idea why we even drove there. The plot is all about the plague - the stories are  rather disgusting than spooky. The language is not really suitable for kids. The actors did invest efforts but I think it did not work out so well - it was hard to hear them, sometimes they were way too far, sometimes way too close in our personal spaces.

The history part is of no use really as its so garbled and fragmented.

Overall, the tour is a licence to print  money for the operator and I got a strong sense that they cant be bothered to change it in any way.

The rest of the house, after the initial video on the family, is largely focused on Oscar.

Daniel OConnell, known as The Liberator, was a driving force behind the movement for Catholic emancipation and the repeal of discriminatory laws against Catholics in Ireland. Designed by the esteemed sculptor John Henry Foley, the monument stands as a majestic landmark at the southern end of OConnell Street, Dublins principal thoroughfare. It was unveiled in 1882, years after OConnells death in 1847, as a fitting tribute to his tireless efforts to advance the cause of Irish freedom and equality. The monument itself is a masterpiece of Victorian-era sculpture and architecture. At its pinnacle stands a commanding statue of Daniel OConnell, depicted in a dignified pose, his outstretched hand gesturing toward the future. Surrounding him are four allegorical figures representing the virtues that defined his life and legacy: Patriotism, Fidelity, Courage, and Eloquence. These figures, crafted in bronze, serve as eternal guardians of OConnells vision and ideals. The monuments Corinthian column, rising over 50 feet into the Dublin skyline, is adorned with intricate carvings and ornamental details, a testament to Foleys artistic skill and craftsmanship. At its base, four bronze winged victories hold laurel wreaths, symbolizing the triumph of justice and the enduring spirit of the Irish people. Over the years, the OConnell Monument has become more than just a statue; its a place of pilgrimage, remembrance, and reflection for countless visitors from around the world. It stands as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought for Irish independence and a beacon of hope for future generations. As Dublins most iconic landmark, the OConnell Monument continues to inspire and unite the people of Ireland, reminding them of their shared history and the enduring values of freedom, justice, and equality for all.

It was built in 1757 and was the largest smock windmill in Europe used to power the Roe Whiskey Distillery. A smock mill is a type of windmill that consists of a sloping sides that resembled smocks worn by farmers in the Netherlands, where their construction originated. George Roe and Company started their company here in the 1750 s and by 1887 it had expanded into the largest distillery in Europe. At that time the Thomas Street Distillery covered 17 acres and was producing 2 million gallons of whiskey annually. Roe Whiskey was exported to the United States, Canada and Australia as well as to all over Europe. The Row family became so wealthy that they even funded the restoration of Christ Church Cathedral. By the turn of the new century however the whiskey industry went into a global decline. By 1926 the distillery had ceased producing whiskey but held large quantities of unsold stock in storage. In the mid 1940 s the company finally dissolved and in 1949 the next door neighbours, a little unknown company called Guinness bought the entire site!

A legend has it that the statute is A retelling of ancient the Irish myth of King Lir, his four children and his powerful wife Aoife, that forms the basis the of the ballet classic, Swan Lake. It goes on to say Many years ago, in ancient Ireland lived a King and ruler of the sea, called Lir. He had a beautiful wife, called Eva, who gave him four children   eldest son Aodh, a daughter called Fionnula and twin boys, Fiachra and Conn. When children were young, their mother Eva died. Lir and children were very sad, and King wanted a new mother for his young sons and daughter, so he married Eva s sister Aoife who, it was said, possessed magical powers. Aoife loved the children and Lir at first, but soon she became very jealous of the time that King spent with Aodh, Fionnula, Fiachra, and Conn. She wanted to have all of his attention for herself. One day, she took children to swim in a lake while the sun was hot in the sky. When they got there and children took to the water, Aoife used her powers to cast a spell over children, which would turn them all into beautiful swans. She knew that if she killed children, their ghosts would haunt her forever, so instead, she cast this spell, forcing them to live as swans for 900 years; three hundred on Lake Derravaragh, three hundred on Straits of Moyle, and three hundred more on Isle of Inish Glora. The spell would only be broken when children heard the ringing of a bell, and arrival of St. Patrick in Ireland. But Aoife s spell had not taken away children s voices, and so it was that these four beautiful swans could sing beautiful songs and were able to tell their father what had happened to them. Lir, who had been searching for his children, came down to the lake and saw Fionnuala, now a swan, who told him of spell cast on them by Aoife. Enraged, he banished Aoife into the mist, and she was never seen again. Although saddened by his children s fate, Lir remained a good father and spent his days faithfully by the lake listening to their singing. Their three hundred years on Lake Derravaragh were filled with joy, but at end of this first part of their spell, children had to say goodbye to their father forever. They travelled to Straits of Moyle, where they spent three hundred years enduring fierce storms and spent much time separated from each other. But they survived these three hundred years, and eventually traveled, together again, to fulfil final stage of their spell, on a small saltwater lake on Isle of Inish Glora. The King by now had passed, and of his once glorious castle nothing but ruins remained. One day, they heard the distant ringing of a bell   one of the first Christian bells in all of Ireland   and swans followed the sound, knowing that end of their spell was near. They followed bells to house of a holy man called Caomhog, who cared for them for last years of their fate. One day though, disaster struck again, when a man appeared at house dressed in armor, saying he was King of Connacht, and he had come for now legendary and mystical swans with beautiful singing voices. He threatened to tear down and ruin Caomhog s house if swans did not come with him, but just as he was laying his hands on them, bell tolled again, and mist of lake came and enveloped swans, turning them back into children they were nine hundred years before. The frightened King of Connacht fled immediately, and children in their human form started to age rapidly. Caomhog knew that they soon would die, so he quickly christened them before their human bodies passed away, so that their legend and their names could live on forever, for these were Children of Lir.",5 years ago,2019-07-02 22:58:33.777405,,,,0,439,2349,True,,

The experience has super friendly and patient trainers.  The trainers teach you the rules and skills step by step, which then allows you to play a short game.  The tour can be as intense or as relaxed as you want.  It was a very memorable experience and I would highly recommend doing this tour for an Irish experience. The experience is about 3 hours long and you learn three sports:  the first is handball (not the same as Olympic handball - more like squash or racquetball).  Then, they teach you the rules of hurling, which is like field hockey mixed with lacrosse mixed with baseball mixed with cricket.   The last sport they teach you is gaelic football.  That is like basketball mixed with soccer mixed with volleyball and also like American football or rugby.  They take breaks between each sport to explain the rules and give you glasses of water.  The facilities are very nice as well. It is super interesting to learn the history of these sports, how they came to be, and how the Gaelic Athletic Association is an amateur sporting association -- in fact, it is the largest amateur sports association in the world.  Each neighborhood in Ireland has its own club, and the residents play only for their area clubs.  The association does not have any professional players - just amateur players.  They explained how previously the British would ban or restrict their ability to play these traditional sports.  Recently there has been a resurgence in these traditional sports, which is great to see right now.  The trainers also answer all of the questions you may have about any of the sports, how to play the sports, or even about life in Ireland. In conclusion, this experience playing Irish sports is the best and most fun way to experience your time in Ireland, especially if you are traveling with children who like to do active things while on vacation in a foreign country.  As a parent, this experience is a great alternative to indoor activities such as video games, youtube, chess, or other games you may play indoors.  I can not recommend this experience enough.  My children are still talking about the three sports even though it is over.  They will remember this experience forever and playing Gaelic sports will be a highlight of the vacation for them.",3 months ago,2024-04-02 22:58:34.180555,,,,1,101,14,True,,

There has been a place of worship situated on the site from an original church built by the Vikings in the 11th century. While originally Roman Catholic, it is now a Church of Ireland Cathedral. It was enlarged in the 13th century under the direction of Strongbow and suffered a major collapse during the 16th century. It was restored and extended to its current glory in the late 19th century with the addition of the tower and Romanesque flying buttresses. They also added the bridge section during this restoration. Today it still remains a place of worship with regular services. During other times it is a huge tourist attraction and, while there is a small entry charge, is a great visit while in Dublin. #Dublin #dublinireland #dublinstreets #dublinstagram #dublincity #dublinfood #dublinphotographer #dublinpub #dublinfoodie #discoverdublin #dublinrestaurants #dublinreviews #visitdublin",4 months ago,2024-03-02 22:58:36.301488,Thank you The Irish Chef Abroad for the wonderful 5-star review!,4 months ago,2024-03-02 22:58:36.301488,1,77,587,True,,

ChIJTzCMroIOZ0gRipj-adVtQCk,Grattan Bridge,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcEpXZXp3RRAB,5,"Grattan Bridge (Irish: Droichead Grattan) is a road bridge spanning the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland, and joining Capel Street to Parliament Street and the south quays. The first bridge on this site was built by Sir Humphrey Jervis in 1676. It was named as Essex Bridge to honour Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It joined several of Jervis developments (including Capel Street and Jervis Street) to the opposite side of the river and to Dublin Castle. Essex Bridge was an arched stone structure with 7 piers, and apparently partly constructed from the ruined masonry of nearby St. Mary s Abbey on the northside. In 1687 the bridge was damaged by a flood resulting in the loss of a hackney and two horses. The damage to the bridge was only partially repaired. In 1751 the second most northerly pier collapsed and damaged the adjacent arches. Between 1753 and 1755 the bridge was rebuilt by George Semple, to correct flood and other structural damage and as one of the first initiatives of the Wide Streets Commission. During this construction, some original features were removed, including the Equestrian Statue Of George I, by John van Nost the Elder, which was moved in 1798 to the gardens of the Mansion House. In 1937 it was bought by the Barber Institute for Fine Arts in Birmingham, in front of which it now stands. For much of the 18th century, Essex Bridge was the most westerly bridge on the Liffey. From 1872, the bridge was further remodelled (on Westminster Bridge in London), being widened and flattened with cast iron supports extended out from the stonework so as to carry pavements on either side of the roadway. The bridge was (and is still) lit by ornate lamp standards also in cast iron. The bridge was reopened as Grattan Bridge in 1874, being named after Henry Grattan MP (1746-1820). From 2002, Dublin City Council undertook a reconstruction of the bridge deck,[8] with granite paving for the footpaths and a set of benches with wooden seats and toughened glass backs. As part of what was intended to be a European-style book market, in 2004 several temporary kiosks (prefabricated in Spain) were also controversially built on the bridge. Originally intended to create a contemporary version of an inhabited bridge, such as the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, these kiosks were later removed. As is tradition among Dubliners, the name used locally for the bridge will vary from Capel Street Bridge, to Grattan Bridge and the original Essex Bridge.",3 years ago,2021-07-02 22:58:38.945535,,,,0,33,,False,,

The park was once the Graveyard of the nearby Newgate Prison and the debtors prison known as the Black dog. Lately landscaped by Dublin City Council.

Situated across several sites, each branch of the museum provides a unique window into different aspects of Irish life, art, and natural history. The Archaeology branch, located on Kildare Street in Dublin, is a treasure trove of ancient artifacts. It boasts an impressive array of Celtic and medieval artifacts, including the renowned Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch, which are marvels of craftsmanship and design. The exhibition on the Viking era is particularly captivating, offering insight into the daily lives and intricate artistry of these influential settlers. The layout is generally well-conceived, with chronological progression that aids in understanding the historical context. However, the space can sometimes feel cramped, especially during peak tourist seasons, which can detract from the overall experience. The Decorative Arts and History branch, housed in the historic Collins Barracks, presents a wide array of objects ranging from weaponry and furniture to costumes and ceramics. This site effectively illustrates the evolution of Irish decorative arts and the broader social and political changes over centuries. The military history section is particularly well-curated, providing a detailed narrative of Irelands complex and often tumultuous past. One critique is that the sheer volume of items on display can be overwhelming, potentially leading to exhibition fatigue. More interactive displays and multimedia presentations could enhance visitor engagement and learning. The Natural History branch, affectionately known as the  Dead Zoo,  offers a fascinating glimpse into the natural world with its extensive taxidermy collection. While this branch has a certain old-world charm, it has faced criticism for its outdated displays and lack of modern interpretive materials. Plans for refurbishment are in place, which will hopefully address these concerns and rejuvenate the exhibition spaces, making them more accessible and engaging for contemporary audiences. Lastly, the Country Life branch in County Mayo provides an immersive experience into the rural history of Ireland. The exhibits here are thoughtfully presented, highlighting the daily lives, crafts, and traditions of rural Irish communities. This branch is particularly praised for its interactive elements and educational programs, which bring history to life for visitors of all ages. Overall, the National Museum of Ireland excels in presenting the country s rich heritage across its various branches. Each site offers a unique perspective and depth of content that is both educational and engaging. With ongoing improvements and updates, particularly in the Natural History branch, the museum continues to be a pivotal institution for preserving and interpreting Ireland s past. The primary areas for enhancement include better spatial management in the Archaeology branch and more modern, interactive displays to cater to a diverse and international audience.",a month ago,2024-06-02 22:58:45.721823,,,,5,315,1297,True,,

Pass a Talking Statue, swipe your smartphone on a nearby plaque and presto, get a call back from James Joyce (written by Roddy Doyle and voiced by Gabriel Byrne), Oscar Wilde (written by John Banville and voiced by Andrew Scott), or Fidelity on the OConnell Monument (written by Paula Meehan and voiced by Ruth Negga)! Each has a story to tell. Together, they tell Dublins story.

Overall we enjoyed our visit but you couldn t spend the whole day here. You would want to combine it with another activity in the day to really appreciate it. I did buy the tickets in advance but on our visit there was no need to. Staff were very nice. They offered to take a photo for an additional charge as well but we re not pushy when we turned them down for this.

Theres a horror part featuring Hannibal lectre and a small setting of shining. The horror part is optional, so you dont have to walk through it and just skip it.

We visited several beer breweries and whiskey distilleries and this was BY FAR the best. I would highly recommend this tour above any other. Other places such as Guinness can handle a lot of people but this one was the most informative and best experience! We booked a tour online had no wait time. Our tour guide JOHN was phenomenal. Very professional, personable and friendly. John is very knowledgeable and provided a riveting tour on the history of the land, church, and whiskey. Although I had been to other tours and museums I did not fully understand the process behind distilling. John explained it in such a way that it clicked for me and it was just a valuable tour. I absolutely loved the added history of the location of the graveyard. He even added historical context of other distilleries, monuments and historical figures. The church in which the distillery is absolutely breathtaking. Also the whiskey was very good. I throughly enjoyed the tasting and discussing the flavors and experiences elicited. We also added drops of water to the whiskey which was so fun to experiment with. 10 out of 10 would recommend the tour with John. It was certainly one of the most enjoyable moments in Dublin.

I forgot the initial guides name, but he explained so much of the history and we talked a while about the graveyard and the numbers of people buried there. I was fascinated! After entering the church, it was incredible seeing the amount of work they had done not only making it into a distillery, but maintaining the beauty of the cathedrals personality and history.

Then we got a tour of the grounds and then a tour of the main church itself where the distillery facilities were based. We got to try a number of whiskeys between 4-12 years old, a Hapenny Gin at the end which was unexpected, and the new Pearse Lyon s Genesis whiskey which has a very unique packaging designed after the glass spire that replaced the original destroyed church spire.

We allocate this time as it is enough to talk you through your whiskeys and also leaves enough time to check out our gift shop. Thank you again for visiting and for the nice review.

They offer a few tasting tours, while all of them are the same, the difference is the amount of pours you get. 3, 4, or 5. Each comes with a starter pour while the video at the start plays so thats an extra for all of them. The Gin is included on every tasting and while good, wasnt the best. ( Even on the tour the guide gave us all club soda with it) The Whiskeys are very clean and easy to drink, partially owed to Irish Whiskey being lower proof on average than America Whiskey. The guides were fabulous and the entire staff crew were genuine and kind. The cemetery out back is interesting and a sight to see, but the star of the show is the church. The church is worth the tour alone, even if you dont drink. Dont miss it. The Whiskey bottles are very expensive but its craft Whiskey in Dublin so its worth grabbing a bottle.

Among the burials are Sir Thomas Moore s family plot, John Keogh (1740 1817), friend of Wolfe Tone. Hugh Leeson, the brewer, whose family gave its name to Leeson Street. The Lessons were Earls of Milltown and owners of Russborough House, County Wicklow. John DArcy owner of the Anchor brewery is buried here. DArcys funeral led to a huge public acrimonius dispute between Daniel OConnell and the Guinness family.

Yesterday I brought my Italian partner to the Jeanie with the hope it would be educational and add some weight, emotion, relatability and gravity to the Great Irish Famine. Noels tour certainly delivered. I felt his tour fleshed out and humanised the victims of the genocide that was the Great Famine. A genocide that is globally treated in a light-hearted, joking fashion, largely due to the depictions of the Irish in things like the Simpsons. Noel, tactfully and rightly did not use the G word, as it may put off those uninitiated to the subject.

ChIJXfZzqpwOZ0gRXSXFEdlq55c,Parliament House,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxeE5ybk1REAE,5,"Parliament House (Irish: Tithe na Parlaiminte) in Dublin, Ireland, was home to the Parliament of Ireland, and since 1803 has housed the Bank of Ireland. It was the worlds first purpose-built bicameral parliament house. It is located at College Green. Originally it was the site of Chichester House, which was built in the early 17th century by Sir Arthur Chichester. This building was adapted for use by the Irish Parliament in the 1670s, and was demolished to make way for a new parliamentary building. Chichester House was flanked by rows of narrow houses known as Dutch Billies, which were demolished and replaced during the Wide Streets Commission. Construction started in 1729. The building was home to the two Houses of Parliament, serving as the seat of both chambers (the Lords and Commons) of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland for most of the 18th century until that parliament was abolished by the Act of Union of 1800, when Ireland became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The current parliament building is Leinster House. Initially, the former Parliament House was used for a variety of purposes, including as a military garrison and as an art gallery. In 1803 the fledgling Bank of Ireland bought the building from the British Government for PS40,000 for use as its headquarters.[3] One proviso stipulated that it was to be modified so it could never again be used as a parliament. As a result, the chamber was broken up to form small offices and by a magnificent cash office. Architect Francis Johnston (then the most prominent architect working in Ireland) was employed to oversee the conversion. However, the House of Lords chamber survived almost unscathed. It was used as the banks board room until the 1970s when the bank moved its headquarters. The chamber is now open to the public and is used for various public functions, including music recitals. Some of the buildings contents survived. The ceremonial mace of the House of Commons remained in the family of the last Speaker of the House of Commons, John Foster, MP. The Bank of Ireland bought the Mace at a sale in Christies in London in 1937. The Chair of the Speaker of the House of Commons is now in the possession of the Royal Dublin Society, while a bench from the Commons is in the Royal Irish Academy. The original two tapestries remained in the House of Lords. The chandelier of the House of Commons now hangs in the Examination Hall of Trinity College, Dublin. The Woolsack, on which the Lord Chancellor of Ireland sat when chairing sessions of the House of Lords, is now back on display in the chamber. Copies of debates of the old Irish Parliament are now kept in Leinster House, keeping a direct link between the two eras. In January 1919, Irish republican MPs elected in the 1918 general election assembled to form the First Dail and issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. They chose the Round Room of the Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Dublin for their home. (The Round Room had more royal connections than the old Parliament House; it had been built for the visit of King George IV in 1821.)",3 years ago,2021-07-02 22:59:08.900563,,,,1,33,,False,,

ChIJg7hjxyUPZ0gR2IHVBtqkGBg,Luke Kelly Sculpture,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdTVTbVB3EAE,5,A beautiful artwork in an unexpected location. Yet there is method in the madness as the rustic industrial feeling of the statue is echoed in the background with a hulking rusting ancient Victorian creation over the water. The hair/beard as metal wires further reinforces this theme. Theres over 270 statutes dotted across Dublin. This is my favourite and Im sure loads of other folks favourites. The reason is that it reflects its environment & also the expression on Lukes face. Too many public artworks of notable people have them with either neutral facial expression or a gentle smile. This is Luke in the throngs of singing his soul out. It brings it alive in a deep meaningful way.,7 months ago,2023-12-02 22:59:13.804866,,,,0,121,1196,True,,

Treated marble was used for the formation of the head while treated metal wire was used to form the hair and beard. The hair is attached through the use of a metal mesh wig while the moustache is made of individual pieces of wire which were drilled into the face of the statue. An initial model with hair was made in smaller near life sized form. A secondary larger statue was then created from plaster but without hair. This second statue was then used for 3D scanning to create the final larger sized version replicated in marble via a 5-axis cnc milling machine in Italy. The appearance is based on a distinctive pose of Luke Kelly with his eyes closed while performing and is said to be taken from a still from his performance of Scorn Not His Simplicity on a show hosted by Jim McCann in 1974 called McCann Man.

ChIJg7hjxyUPZ0gR2IHVBtqkGBg,Luke Kelly Sculpture,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNLXRLWU5REAE,5,"Since we were in this side of Dublin we decided that it would be a shame not to have a quick gander at Dublin s newest statute, a Luke Kelly sculpture situated just across the bridge on the edge of Guild Street and Sheriff Street, to mark the 35th anniversary of his death. (Died in 1984 of a brain tumour aged just 43). Luke was born into a working-class household in Sheriff Street, in 1940. Luke Kelly, with his very distinctive singing style, was a quintessential Dublin singer, folk musician, and social activist, and a hero and all round Irish legend to many. Luke, of course, was a prominent member of The Dubliners, the Irish trad specialists, whose versions of Irish classics like  The Rocky Road to Dublin ,  Seven Drunken Nights ,  The Town I Loved So Well ,  On Raglan Road  enthralled millions of people not just in Ireland but all across the world, a folk singer that will forever be remembered. Designed by German born but Dublin based artist, Vera Klute, the sculpture is quite distinctive and definitely stands out, showing a big curly red head and bearded Luke on display for the whole world to see. Eye catching, just like Luke Kelly was, that being the point I guess! It s quite big and I have to say it s a great piece of artistic work, getting Kelly s facial expressions down to a tee. Hats off to Vera Klute, this is an excellent sculpture and one that the people of the Northside can be proud of. But wait a minute, the statue was apparently vandalized with graffiti just a few weeks after its unveiling! No one knows why but I was thinking perhaps it might be that the statue is really not in the heart of Sheriff Street but just across the bridge on the edge of the area he was from, and nearer to the nicer part of the town? Walking straight across the bridge to the statue one can be in no doubt that you are walking across a social divide, at least that was the impression I got, and not so much a gift to the local people but something for the tourists to gawk at and then promptly turn right around least they venture too close to the centre of Sheriff Street. Or maybe I am putting too much into that Anyway, thankfully the graffiti was removed and the statue was restored in all its glory by the time we had a look.",10 months ago,2023-09-02 22:59:14.210139,,,,0,495,2864,True,,

The Hapenny Bridge is also named after him but nobody ever utters his name with that one. Like all obelisks, it serves no purpose but many young people make attempts to climb up bits of it.

An influential organiser for workers rights, his role in the Easter Rising cemented his legacy, with his particularly cruel execution helping to fan the flames of Irish independence. Born in Edinburgh, June 5th, 1868, Connolly first went to Ireland as a fourteen year old member of the British Army. He married in Scotland where he became involved in Socialism. In 1896 he moved to Dublin where he founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party and also started a newspaper the Workers  Republic. He spent seven years in America where he lectured and organized. He was an organizer for the Wobblies in the New York area. Connolly returned to Ireland in 1910 and campaigned for the Socialist Party. Jim Larkin appointed him as Ulster Organiser for the ITGWU in Belfast but in 1913 he came back to Dublin to help during the Lockout. Connolly was one of the founders of the Irish Citizen Army. Throughout his life he wrote and published extensively on Irish and socialist issues. Tom Clarke was always sure to include Connolly and the ICA in any IRB or Volunteer celebrations, e.g. Rossa s funeral in 1915 or the Wolfe Tone commemoration. During the Easter Rising he was appointed Commandant-General of the Dublin brigade, directing the Army of the Irish Republic in the GPO.

Clearly a big demand for this sort of park based on the numbers using it, Dublin city council really should install more skate parks around the city! I cant understand why they included gravel at the sides of the paths, it only ends up getting all over the concrete where people are trying to skate...would suggest replacing with bigger flower beds, grass or just widening the paths. As the skate park is quite small for the numbers who use it, I would recommend they extend it out by replacing a big empty grass area in the middle (this is wasted space at the moment). They could even increase the size of the kids playground and fence the whole kids area off properly so there is a separate entrance and exit - as its dangerous having so many little kids running between the skate park and the playground, requiring parents to be extra watchful.

Went there with a group of 8, the place is not big and we had no reservation, so we gratefully accepted to be seated separately. 10 mins later the staff moved us to a table for the whole group. So really appreciated their attention to detail and flexibility. Food was as great as their staff! Best Irish breakfast in Dublin! I tried different Irish breakfast versions during my time at Dublin and this was hands down the very best. Fresh ingredients for a delicious homemade, farm-to-table Irish breakfast. I just wish the beans came included with the breakfast but its great that you can order them as a side (generous portion of beans, by the way). Coffee was also perfect!

Prices are reasonable, I m a poor college student and I found it affordable. Come early in the morning to find piles of fresh scones. I tried the lemon poppyseed, blueberry, and raspberry, and they were probably some of the best scones I ve ever had. Absolutely cannot miss. The cappuccinos are well-done and affordable. You get a pretty big cup for  4.50 I believe. I was able to get non-fat milk instead of whole. It had a good amount of foam and had nice flavor.

We truly appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to clarify any concerns you may have.

The difference in appearance might be due to the different ingredients and preparation methods used, which can sometimes give the impression of a size difference. We understand your concern about the pricing. The cost of producing our vegan sausage rolls is actually twice as much as the pork sausage rolls due to the high-quality, plant-based ingredients used. We strive to provide the best quality products to our customers and sometimes, this comes with a higher cost. We believe that the price is justified considering the cost price of our delicious vegan sausage rolls. We apologize if this was not clear and caused any confusion.

My friends had to leave before me because they had booked a tour and I was left sitting by myself. Finally, I decided to ask the waitress to cancel the order, but, since that wasnt a possibility, I settled on take-out.

Their beans are for sale in paper-based bags and they also sell them in 1 Kg sizes, reducing packaging a little. Most food on display (including sandwiches) is packaging-free (my current pet peeve is sandwiches in plastic clamshells). Along with their house blend they also offer a single-origin coffee, which changes every few months. Their Harcourt Rd. branch has a Saturday brunch menu that includes organic porridge, free-range eggs, and simple vegetarian fare like avocado toast. The main thing I d like to know about is their coffee sourcing   sustainability and fair pricing. Their website and coffee packages don t offer any info on this.

We ordered the eggs benedict with bacon and avocado on toast. The food arrived and we got two eggs benedict. The reciept we got was someone elses order and we found out that our avocado was given to wrong customer. Either the chef put all orders out at same time and waitress messed up or he done orders wrong. Which means the avocado came out to other customer 10 minutes earlier my eggs would be sitting there for a long time. They went to cook the avocado and toast while I ate mine, which was not very nice. Bacon was though like it had been cooked, let cool and reheated. The poached eggs were more like a hard boiled egg. For me poached eggs should be soft. After i finished and my girlfriends toast was still not ready and we had to leave. When we told them the chef behind the counter threw his eyes to heaven and tried to push the avocado eggs and toast on us in a take away bag. Not something you pay that much money for to eat out of bag. We were offered a free pastery...... Id say stick to the coffee and pasteries which are nice.

The chicken sandwich had great bread and was really nicely marinated, but the chicken was very cold out the fridge.

We complied, but when the bill arrived, the alcoholic drinks were still on it. This was puzzling and frustrating. If the restaurant knows it cant serve alcohol, it should not have been on the menu or the order in the first place. Moreover, my choice of babaganoush was disappointing.

However, what truly stood out during my visit was the exceptional service provided by Manager Ludmila. Her attention to detail and dedication to ensuring every customers satisfaction was evident throughout my entire visit. Not only did Ludmila greet each customer with a genuine smile, but she also took the time to engage with them, making everyone feel welcome and valued. Her knowledge of the menu was impressive, and she was more than happy to provide recommendations based on my preferences. Furthermore, Ludmilas leadership skills were apparent in the way she effortlessly coordinated the team, ensuring that orders were taken promptly and efficiently. Despite the busy atmosphere, she remained composed and approachable, handling any issues with grace and professionalism. In addition to the exceptional service, the quality of the coffee   exceeded my expectations. Each sip of my latte was rich and perfectly balanced, and the cheesy mushroom toastie with its perfectly toasted bread and generous filling of savory mushrooms and gooey cheese, this sandwich is a delightful treat for your taste buds.

However, after today, I dont really feel that keen on visiting any of their branches. The first issue was that having ordered Too Good To Go, we arrived at the store only to find it was cancelled. I enquired at the till as to why (due to an abundance of food being present). I received a curt reply that this was definitely going to sell in the next half hour; reader, it didnt. This was fine honestly though, I understand that an establishment needs all its profits. However, I decided to take part in the 50% off in the last hour deal. I went to the checkout, only to be met by an incredibly sour worker, who gave no greeting or indication of the price. It was only after tapping that I realised I was charged full price. Apparently it was take away only (depsite literally every other branch being sitting in, and the Hot Food at 50% off sign not having that stipulation). I was given absolutely no offer of compromise, or any kind of empathy. I do understand a business needs to be run, but honestly, the staff were so rude.

I wouldn t call it good value, i.e.  17.50 for Full Irish Breakfast,  15.90 for Avocado Toast,  5.10 for Latte, and  4.40 for tea. But it s understandable, considering its premium location. However, the quality of our food was pretty disappointing, at least for our visit today. I m not sure if it is really  full  Irish breakfast when baked beans, mushrooms and hash browns were missing, and fried eggs were replaced by poached ones. You might argue it s a healthier option. But who would order full Irish breakfast in the first place, if he/she takes healthy eating as a priority? It is perfectly fine if boiled or steamed bacon/sausage were to be introduced in the future for those value good diet over taste, but I think at least the customer should have been given the opportunity to choose fried eggs if he/she prefers the traditional/classic way of Irish cooking. And the rashers of bacon were so dry and hard, and my friends had to send them back to the kitchen. Also the presentation of the dish has some room for improvement, for a premium price of  17.50. The picture says it all As per the attached photo, there was a very thin layer (not really much thicker than the butter spread you would put on a toast) of meshed avocado on the small and extremely dry sourdough bread. And it was topped with pickled onion slices, which I personally consider a strange combination and don t think it goes well with the taste and texture of avocado. The Latte was pretty good. And it should be, for the price of  5.10. The Irish breakfast tea was OK. The waiter was very kind and professional, for which I added a tip to my payment, even though the food was far below our expectations. The decoration and atmosphere were both great. Bewley s has a long history, a good brand and nice atmosphere, which for sure attracts and will keep attracting tourists.

Inside there was an oase of tranquility of people working, talking, enjoying and being themselves. It is a small but lovely place where you get an honest and completely self made lunch. Even though my double espresso became a ristretto and was a tag cold, it is forgiven. It tasted perfect. We took a whole included lunch for 30,-/prs: the afternoon lunch. It is served on a tray of plates with a savoury plate of home made sandwiches on home made bread, with e.g. homemade cream and home made jam/jello. There was some salad with a really nice dressing, so don t ignore that. Your dessert-plate is in the meanwhile waiting for you on top. First you might think, no two of everything, but as you start you realize that you are forced to get romantisch and share.

The cake cafe is somewhere that if you didnt know was there, you might never find it. hen you do, your entire day is a little be brighter. You can get to the cake cafe either by going THROUGH the last bookshop directly on Camden (which is worth a visit in of itself, just to see the resident doggo, Bertie) OR you can take the side road and get there that way as well. When you enter the courtyard, you will be captivated by the my secret garden atmosphere and instantly feel at ease. You have your choice of either outside tables or inside. Both are lovely, but you have the chance of getting to pet a wonderful dog! This pet friendly place is no strangers to dogs, and provides water for the weary woolly traveling companion that you may find with their human entourage. Clearly, outdoor is the only option. One day down and situated, the friendly staff will give you a menu, one which includes mimosas, your choice of coffee, or some wine if youre in the mood. The menu is short but sweet, and gives you a pretty great variety to go through. I asked the waitress what her favourite was, which led to me getting the smashed Avocado on toast. As the meat glutten that I am, I couldnt pass up the chorizo, so I had that added on! BOY WAS THAT THE BEST IDEA EVER. The food came out pretty quickly, and prepared to perfection. The toast was perfectly cooked, the ingredients were fresh, and the avocado was perfect. The chorizo was a great addition to add a bit of spice to it, which to me, rounded out the dish perfectly. Ill never not get their chorizo again. IT WAS THAT GOOD. The flat white was fine as well. To be harsh, I wouldnt say its the best coffee Ive had in Dublin, but it was prepared beautifully, the coffee wasnt burnt, and the coffee to milk ratio  for my flat white was on point! So overall, it was great! Im incredibly snobby and critical when it comes to coffee, so my fine is likely very very good for normal humans. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this place. Stunningly perfect food, coupled with great customer service, great atmosphere, great coffee and overall great experience.

The bread was cut too thick, meaning it was a very dry sandwich as the ratio of bread to filling was nearly 3:1!  The goats cheese was plopped in the middle of the sandwich, so that most bites were just veg. I got Mayo to make it less dry. After being a waitress so many times over the years,  I have a high but fair standard of what good service entails. The server was perhaps new, and so inexperienced, but despite the restaurant being not that full, I had to go up and ask for a refill of water and it took them a long time to take my plate away when empty.

ChIJkeSG4oIOZ0gR_wPxNdF0ynM,Jay Kays Cafe,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkOEtHbEVREAE,3,"Jays Cafe fell short of expectations despite its 4.5-star rating and a high number of reviews. While the service was swift, the coffee left much to be desired, featuring a disagreeable sharp taste and lacking body. Disappointingly, the eggs benedict were overcooked, and the absence of sides, like fried potatoes, was notable. Additionally, the oversight of not providing condiments such as balsamic further detracted from the dining experience. The wobbly table and cramped corner seating contributed to an uncomfortable atmosphere.  Jays Cafe dining is indicative of a hospital cafeteria. Although a saving grace was found in the enjoyable Irish burrito, the overall impression suggests that Jays Cafe may be more fittingly rated as a 3 to 3.5-star establishment. It appears that certain aspects, particularly the coffee quality and attention to detail in dish presentation, did not align with the high rating and extensive praise. While individual preferences play a role, the discrepancy between expectations and reality may leave patrons seeking a more consistent and well-rounded dining experience elsewhere.",4 months ago,2024-03-02 23:02:30.738367,,,,1,212,1309,True,,

I ordered an oat milk latte (steamed perfectly, not too hot, doesnt taste burnt or flat), along with the eggs & toast + bacon, and a side of garlic potatoes w/ lemon aioli. The toast is thick and crispy, the eggs a lovely medium/mw, perfectly salted, comes with sambal (spicy chili sauce) on the plate if you want to elevate the flavors even more. The potatoes were soft and crispy, the aioli just tangy enough, the plating simple and rustic. Im so happy I stopped here before the Cathedral. Im extremely picky about my lattes and they knocked it out of the park. Service was kind and quick, even sitting in the back courtyard (which felt like a Main Character moment). If I lived here I would be a regular. Vegetarian options: They have a small menu but its varied enough to suit most eaters.

We understand it is very disappointing for you, as it is for us to read. Our team prepared and created our usual quantity of salads today.    However, there appeared to be an event in a nearby building, which resulted in an early rush and an additional demand for our salads. David, Honey Truffle employs a full team of chefs who prepare everything we offer freshly each day.    Indeed we do offer a very full and vibrant selection of salads daily,  We also try balance preparation of food and avoidance of food wastage.  Our salad selection is presented around 11.45am/12noon and usually it is after 1.30-2pm when our salads diminish  as demand for lunch softens.     As you mentioned, there were more salads being made , as quickly as our kitchen team could possibly manage.. this does take a little time. .  I understand there were also sandwiches on offer (and more being prepared freshly in the kitchen) , as well our homemade soup available  at the time of your visit. As a team we really do our very best . But we cannot always get things right . Particularly when there is an unexpected rush , beyond our control.    Please also note that over the last year, Monday and Friday in the city are much more unpredictable for a small independent fresh food business  providing an additional challenge for our team. Honey truffle also provides an online ordering service, through our website, where from 9.30am customers can order a medium or large salad box (amongst other items) , which we will prepare and set aside for collection.    This can avoid disappointment for all. We hope David that  you will visit us again, as we do indeed provide the a wonderful selection of lunch time options. Apologies again for your disappointment today. All the best, Eimer and Honey Truffle Tram",3 months ago,2024-04-02 23:02:53.310182,0,11,,False,,

It was  4.99 and the contents were meant to be worth  15. It was my first and last time ever going to Guud Day Cafe. It included a breakfast bap, 2 small soups and a sausage roll. I opened the bag which contained the breakfast bap 5 minutes after leaving the cafe. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. The sausage was burnt in parts, the bacon was rock hard and rubbery and the bap itself was freezing cold and extremely soggy. I took a bite and could not chew the meat. The sausage roll was also not fresh enough and was hard to chew also.. the soups both looked fine but my appetite was ruined to be honest so I couldnt stomach any of it. It all had to go in the bin. It was certainly not too good to go it was food fit for the bin. The customer service was the most shocking part though. I emailed on 3rd April. They didnt reply , I rang the cafe numerous times no answer. I went into the cafe on the 11th April to discuss it and see what the cafe could do to resolve the issue. They were very dismissive. Eventually the supervisor said she would get the manager to sort a refund. Later that day the manager replied to the email that I sent on the 3rd and said they wont be issuing a refund and just gave me the prices of what those items would cost to buy if you were to go in and buy them fresh. Not even an apolpgy for the quality of the food or the fact it took 8 days to reply (and only because I went into the cafe in person to complain). Such a terrible experience I would advise people to avoid this place. Pictures included of what this cafe deem as suitable to sell.",a year ago,2023-07-02 23:03:01.442140,,,,1,9,15,False,,

I love my Sunday mornings coffee. As I was staying a bit further out I decided to run in time for Sunday am opening (9am). I was early and I waited outside as it was close to opening. The girl with ink (tattoo) opened up on the dot and greeting me politely and I decided to order inside as my hands were cold (-5 apparently!). The (blonde) girl at the counter addressed me and took my order: americano with hot oat milk, she asked if I wanted anything else, I eventually decided on a plain croissant. Before I even had the chance to sit down and fix myself up I was greeted with:  You pay now! This was extremely aggressive. And I was disappointed from then on. I was literally frozen and this attitude was unacceptable. The coffee itself was great, no doubt about it. The croissant was stale, furthermore was not offered to be warmed up. I drank my beverage and ate my croissant and left by taking my cup and plate to the counter. One star for the polite girl who acknowledged me. One star for the coffee. One star for the warmth inside.

It helps us improve our service, and the experience our customers have when they pop in to see us. Im sorry you didnt enjoy your visit and that you felt the interaction with staff could have been better. We dont do table service, so we take payment when customers order at the till. Well see if theres a way we can make the system clearer to avoid any confusion for our customers in the future. Thanks for pointing this out to us. We source our pastries from an organic bakery and they are baked and delivered fresh every morning. I can say hand-on-heart that our pastries are fresh every morning, so Im at a loss as to why your croissant wasnt up to scratch. But I do hope that you enjoyed your trip to our lovely city.

The playlist was great, the server was very attentive and it was perfect for a nice early dinner. They have a kinda chill bar/retro 60s vibe, very causal. The bathrooms were clean and not divided by gender. We started with drinks, house white was nice and a decent portion of tea. We got the Coco burger, Asian chicken salad and the quesadillas/wraps with a side of fries. All absolutely amazing, super quick service and big portions. The salad wasnt too meat heavy with only a few strips of chicken but the dressing was amazing. We then got apple crumble, gluten free brownies and carrot cake. All were lovely and came with a portion of whipped cream to the side. Portions were a touch small but still really well made desserts!

The waitress asked me to leave in 30ish minutes, soon after I was done with my food and drink, whereas the people who were sitting around for much longer than me were treated with a lot more politeness and respect and faced no pressure to leave even when they werent necessarily ordering. I was alone at my table and the only person of colour at the cafe at that time, and I cant believe people even these days have such biases and differential treatment. I had literally just finished, also considering I was only there for a very short period of time makes it all the more evident that the waitress had her biases towards other races. Even worse, the manager also didnt own up to the bad experience. Really awful and I never wish to go back here again.",a month ago,2024-06-02 23:03:08.372646,"Hello, This is Richard the owner, I am shocked by this review., and take this matter very seriously. Further Update : From General Manager. I was there on the day of the said incident. I had a conversation with you on the day and I wasnt going to apologise or own up to a case of discrimination when there was no racial discrimination . I even find this weird that I now have to point out that I am black and from Africa. I am the General Manager. Lets clarify a few things, 1) You ordered a coffee and a pastry and you were on the table for over an hour. 2) You werent asked to leave. You were asked if you wanted anything else and you said that you were done and after a few minutes the supervisor brought the bill. 3) The supervisor who was dealing with you is a person of colour and I am black. On the day I explained that there was only one table that was there before you and they were also asked if they wanted to order anything else and they had placed second orders. Im not sure whats more frustrating, the fact that you have made this about race when this is simply about being treated the same or the fact that you are suggesting that myself and the supervisor as people of colour we suffer from an inferiority complex that we treat whites more special and discriminate against other people of colour.

Its a small cosy restaurant Cafe, with comfortable light ambiance, that makes several Georgian dishes and Turkish desserts. I have only tried the Khachapuri Adjaruli, which is a crusty bread filled with cheese, a semi fried egg on top, along with butter. (see photo) You have to mix them together before munching. Let me tell you that it was so good and delicious. Be sure to come hungry, so that you can actually finish your meal, since I ordered the small size and still felt satisfying full. In terms of service/ hospitality, it is up to your perspective to what that can be, as I found it quite good. Since the staff can be, and is actually busy at times, and so they might not give you a smile or anything at first, but eventually they will. At least the food can make up for that. It might be beneficial to learn a few Georgian/ Azeri phrases and maybe learn a bit about their cultures, to feel immersed and appreciative, but you really dont have to, just come and try the food.

For a flat white drink had too much foam for me. After years of enjoying coffee I still can t feel the taste of it and I think it s only draws away from the main taste. Beans were almost perfectly roasted, a bit too dark for me, I ve tasted a bit of burning coat in it and the drink was more acidic as I prefer, but not too much so I could enjoy the taste of the drink. For an Brazilian Arabica I unfortunately haven t felt any caramel or chocolate, but the drink had big body and was very soft. When the drink was running up my palate it felt like honey, not too sweet but very pleasant and calm, not even a tinge of sourness was casting a shadow on that feeling. Definitely recommend to everyone, tho keep noted that it is not a place to seat, but a place to take a takeaway coffee and enjoy the quay! #coffee",a year ago,2023-07-02 23:03:20.702785,,,,0,8,8,False,,

Delighted with the comments and it sounds like you found a lot to like about as one. With regards to the food prices. We are only a select few restaurants in the whole country who use the extremely high standard ingredients we use. Organic and seasonal comes at a price for us, but something we are passionate about, although we are still relatively low priced for what we offer. Our prices have increased recently due the food costs increasing by over 50% (due to reasons out of our control) across the board not to mention all of the other aspects that have hurt our business like electricity and staffing costs increasing. We believe we are still in a good pricing point due to the above reasons and how much we concentrate on giving you the best food possible for you and your friends. I can only apologises about the high noise volume in As One and thanks for letting me know so we have been able to monitor this from now on so this does not happen again.

The tuna melt was a great choice of bread and the perfect cheese hasnt had a good combination of string strength and stretch on a melted sub in a long while the only downside was the lettuce was ruined it was too moist in the melt you never warm lettuce its a kitchen rule everywhere and everyone knows that. Would replace a lettuce with a different ingredients to make that perfect tuna melt they have a huge potential with that choice of bread and cheese. As for the carrot cake the extra-sided yogurt was a bit too much for decoration and didnt add much flavor, sometime simple is better. The cake by itself tastes wonderful no need to add anything!

As a devoted connoisseur of pancakes and French toast, I hold every dining experience to high standards, and these expectations can be demanding. On a positive note, the coffee here was rich and satisfying. The service from the staff was a shining star; they were unfailingly courteous and attentive, even when the place was bustling with people. One small downside is the cafes size. They do offer outdoor seating with umbrellas, but Dublins unpredictable weather means its often off-limits due to rain and wind. This cafe is a cozy spot with potential for even more greatness.

From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance and warmth of the restaurant were apparent. The staff were friendly and accommodating, helping to ease the wait time and setting the tone for a pleasant experience. Once seated, I was promptly handed the menu, and my eyes were drawn to the tantalizing array of options. After careful consideration, I decided to indulge in a variety of dishes that caught my attention. The Brunch Hash Brownies intrigued me, and I couldnt resist the urge to try Naniji s Achaar as well. To complete my meal, I ordered a cappuccino and the Buttermilk Pancake. As I awaited my order, the anticipation grew, and I couldnt help but notice the attention to detail in the restaurants decor. When the food arrived, I was taken aback by the impeccable presentation. Each dish was a work of art, beautifully arranged on the plate. The Brunch Hash Brownies were a delightful blend of flavors, and Naniji s Achaar added a tangy twist that was truly unique. The cappuccino was expertly crafted, providing a perfect balance of bold coffee flavor and velvety milk. However, the star of the show had to be the Buttermilk Pancake. It was a culinary masterpiece, fluffy and golden-brown, topped with a generous drizzle of syrup. Each bite was a harmonious blend of sweetness and texture, leaving me craving for more. The overall experience at Slice Restaurant was nothing short of satisfying. The wait, though initially daunting, was rewarded with a meal that exceeded my expectations.

My favourites are the cruffins and almond croissant. Get them to heat it up for you and you will be transported to heaven. They do change their cruffin flavours from time to time. So far Ive had coffee cream filling cruffin and the praline cream cruffin. Both were amazing. My friends love their hot chocolate.  The presentation is lovely and aesthetically pleasing. I am very impressed with they way they present the drinks.  It is served on a beautiful cup on a wooden plate (i dont know if it is called a plate but look at the pictures) This is only if you sit in the cafe. If youre taking away obviously it will be in a paper cup. I think the filter coffee needs improvement. It was way too diluted for a filter coffee. I bought a MIIR tumbler from them too. Its good quality. I usually make tea with it and I pour boiling water into the tumbler. The cup feels absolutely cool to touch. Keeps relatively warm for at least 2 hours.

We always like to go off the beaten track when visiting anywhere and as a result often find places other visitors are less likely to spot. Social Fabric Cafe is exactly one of those jewels. We went out for breakfast and after walking  for 10 or 15 minutes down side streets we made our way inside. It is not a big place, but bright clean, busy, but yet still very welcoming. After being seated our order was taking quite quickly with coffee and tea delivered swiftly. I had a large breakfast and my wife had the Eggs Benedict. Again we didnt have to wait that long, but we were enjoying the buzz of the place, which was filled mainly with local people. The service was fantastic. The food was delicious and it is the best cooked breakfast I have had for a long time. All of the food was locally sourced, brilliantly cooked with amazing flavour.

This innovative chameleon venue has undergone an enormous make over and refurbishment about 6 years ago. The art deco / nouveau theme is still intact but a modern twist has been added with a  faux cafe street  now sitting where the dance floor and balcony once were. It still has its love story appeal, and  has embraced her  twentieth century makeover with grace. For me it is one of my all time favourite venues, I salute its ability to gently transform from an elegant lunch time meet to an afternoon tea delight then into a cocktail destination by early evening and a bustling night time party place until the wee small hours. We arrived as it opened at 11.30 hrs, every member of staff we encountered were professional and ensured our visit was not only a good experience but a memorable one too. The service was approximately timed, we weren t rushed and our 2 hour lunch felt relaxed and enjoyable. My Vegan bowl comprised Quinoa & Edamame, Cabbage Slaw, Cajun Sweet Potato, Avocado, Curry Spiced Cauliflower, Ranch Dressing, Rocket, Toasted Seeds  & I added Buttermilk Chicken, was an absolute delight to the taste buds. We also enjoyed eggs Royale, the Eggs were poached to perfection and enhanced with Spinach, Hash Browns, Ballycotton Smoked Salmon, Hollandaise, Rocket Salad . I liked the addition of water brought to our table without request although the faux Parisian street was something of a surprise. I didn t figure on the make over! However the retractable roof is a novel addition which allows the outside in, which was closed as the wind picked up. It was wonderful to revisit Cafe Em Seine, although I didn t appreciate at the time of booking my last visit was almost 30 years ago. It was interesting to have a wander and explore the new decor on the various levels. Thank you Cafe En Seine for a delicious birthday lunch and the next time I m in Dublin, I will come and visit you again.

The menu was vivid in choice (and me being me, I opted for the fish and chips) which had a small 10 or so waiting time yet tasted like it was being meticulously watched and perfected. The fish was light and crispy, the chips flavourful and the tartar sauce was delicious. (Also came with lemon and curry) the lemon added a punch to the fish that brought out even more flavour. Whilst scanning the drinks menu, I was a little overwhelmed by the wide array of choices and creative concoctions. Despite this, I noticed no  common  cocktails and had asked my waiter if they had a Pornstar Martini, I was delighted to find out that one could be made for me- and it was stupendous!

I was told at the movie theater, if I show my ticket, I would get 10% off, so I figured why not grab a coffee on my way to do some shopping. I walk in and tell my daughter to sit down at a table towards the entrance of the coffee shop and wait for me. I go to the counter, and I place my order for a coffee and a bakery item and I let the cashier (Asian lady with black short hair) know that my order is complete. She then goes,  and what about the water?. Im a bit confused at first, because I did not order water, but she points her head towards my daughter, who is holding a water bottle. When she mentioned the water bottle, she mentioned it in a tone as she was accusing me of grabbing the water as I walked in and trying to not pay for it. It made me feel really uncomfortable and I did not like it. I let her know once again, we literally just left the movie theater and thats where she got the water from. She says nothing, and then processes my order and I pay for it. You all have CCTV in the shop. If you really felt like we grabbed that water without paying for it, you all couldve checked the cameras. I am not risking any legal trouble for 2.30 euros. I make more in a day than she probably makes in a week. Stop being judgmental. This felt very discriminatory and I dont appreciate it at all. I definitely wont be back. I will visit other locations.

We took two Butlers hot chocolate and it was truly delicious. Not as sweet and thick as an Italian hot chocolate but thick enough to be good. The hot chocolate (milk chocolate probably) was strong in flavors and marvelous. With your beverage you can choose a piece of chocolate and I took the crunchy praline which was really good. A little bit too sweet but hey, its praline after all. I would have like to try the other recipes but one cup was more than enough. I dont know if whipped cream would have been better. I thought it was disappointing that the staff didnt take the time to provide a better service even if there were no one when we arrived. We were kinda lost but the staff was cold and not friendly at all so we juste ordered in a hurry, without having the time to study properly the menu. The venue was nice on the bar part but the tables and seats were kinda average, with no decoration. We didnt felt cosy so we just finished our beverages fast and left. Its a nice place to order a hot chocolate since its really good, but I dont recommend that you sat here since its not really warm and cosy. The price is acceptable. Nearly 5  for a hot chocolate; for this quality its not that expensive. I dont know if the other Butlers Chocolate cafe are better but there are a lot of cafe (with seats or no) in the center of Dublin.

Perched atop a dramatic limestone outcrop, this ancient fortress has witnessed centuries of intrigue, conquest, and resilience. As I explored its imposing ruins, I found myself captivated by its aura of mystery and grandeur. The first thing that strikes visitors is the commanding presence of the Rock itself. Rising 150 feet above the surrounding countryside, it offers panoramic views of the rolling hills and lush greenery that define the Irish landscape. The sense of awe that washes over you as you approach is palpable, as if the very stones beneath your feet are whispering tales of bygone eras. Stepping through the weathered archway that marks the entrance, you are instantly transported back in time. The ruins of Dunamase Castle, which dates back to the 9th century, are a maze of crumbling walls, moss-covered stones, and hidden passageways. Despite the ravages of time, the fortress retains an air of regal splendor, its former glory still evident in the intricate carvings and towering battlements. As you wander through the labyrinthine corridors, each turn reveals a new discovery. From the imposing Great Hall, where feasts once echoed with laughter and song, to the atmospheric dungeons, where prisoners languished in darkness, every corner of Dunamase Castle is steeped in history. I found myself lost in reverie, imagining the lives of those who once called this place home. One of the highlights of my visit was the breathtaking view from the summit of the Rock. As I stood atop the ancient ramparts, gazing out over the sweeping vista below, I felt a profound sense of connection to the land and its storied past. The juxtaposition of natural beauty and man-made marvel is truly awe-inspiring, a reminder of the enduring power of human ingenuity. In addition to its historical significance, the Rock of Dunamase also holds a special place in Irish folklore and mythology. Legend has it that the fortress was once the stronghold of Loegaire, a mythical warrior king whose exploits are woven into the fabric of Irish legend. As I explored the ruins, I couldnt help but feel a sense of reverence for the ancient tales that have been passed down through generations. In conclusion, a visit to the Rock of Dunamase is an unforgettable experience that offers a glimpse into Irelands rich and storied past. Whether youre a history buff, a nature enthusiast, or simply someone seeking adventure off the beaten path, this majestic landmark has something to offer everyone. So pack your walking shoes, bring your sense of wonder, and prepare to be transported back in time as you embark on a journey to the heart of County Laois.",2 months ago,2024-05-02 23:04:28.361515,,,,0,99,1814,True,,

It is recommended to truly appreciate the beauty of the region taking a boat tour will allow you to fully enjoy the scenery of the fjord and surrounding mountains.
