0,14 Henrietta Street,4.625,"The museum is very good. I highly recommend it to know more about georgian houses and Dublin's life.
The experience was overall really good. However, the tour was with a group of 20 people, and the rooms are not big enough to appreciate all with big groups. The museum should consider this.
The guide was ok, good information but with no group management at all. He started to talk before the group was inside the room. I've lost half of the tour because of this. This museum tells an important story about perseverance, community building, social class, and the spirit struggle for social justice in Ireland with lessons all societies.
14 Henrietta invites visitors to look inside this Irish history with empathy and build capacity to confront disparities in any way one can. Excellent tour narrative and engaging use of technology. A must visit for locals and tourists. A real look into tenement life in Dublin and the history on how it started. Lloyd was our guide and was brilliant. He is a local who was born and bread close by which added to the experience hearing the history and stories with a local accent and colloquialisms. We learned so much about the history of Dublin on this guided tour, as it related to the people who lived at this location. It is a gorgeous block, used for many film shoots. You would never believe that thousands of people lived in poverty and squalor in these houses that were once grand but then turned into tenements. The last tenant moving out in 1979!! Great place to visit.  Go back in time to the 1700s  through to the 1970s as your guided through the house.  Great guide, and the buildings rooms help transport you to the lives of people as they lived there.  Go to this place if you have any interest in the history of dublin. This is a great historic overview of Georgian house and it's transformation from a mansion of one wealthy family in the 1700's to tenement housing for 26 families through to the 1970's. Gus was our tour guide and he was very knowledgeable and was happy to take questions. This is a must see tour to understand the history of Dublin.
Give yourself and hour and a half for the tour. 14 Henrietta Street is a must-see in Dublin! It gives you a look into the reality of the tenement life. Our guide was knowledgeable and passionate. The tour was about 75 minutes. myself and my wife brought her parents who are from around that area , we really enjoyed the tour, Gillian was fantastic with her knowledge and strong Dublin accent which made you feel right at home, 100% recommend"
1,1916 Rebellion Walking Tour,5.0,"Lorcan is a professional guide, passionate about Irish history, an author, factual and engaging. The real deal, a brilliant walking tour all round. Lorcan is a knowledgeable and passionate historian and storyteller. If you've got the time and want to learn a bit about the origins of the Irish Republic while enjoying a walk around Dublin, then you should check out the tour. You'll have a fun and informative time. Cheers! The tour was the highlight of our visit to Dublin. Lorcan's walk is engaging and extremely informative but with humour, expert story telling, and a deeply human approach. I can't recommend it enough - thanks again Lorcan Lorcan was an amazing tour guide and it was a fascinating journey through Irish history. Highly recommended! An absolute must for any visit to Dublin!
The passion, attention to detail, total showmanship and care for his audience makes this a once in a lifetime experience!
How he engages with his public and manages to wheel out the names and details whilst answering some searching questions is truly amazing.
I knew fragments of the story and in a matter of minutes with his typical jovial nature he had filled in the details, debunked some very common myths and gleefully but rightly expressed his frank and funny opinion of some historical figures.

If only my history teacher had had 1% of his talent, enthusiasm and social skills, I'd be a history graduate today.

If you skip this tour, it's because you're a total idiot and have missed out on a once in a lifetime experience!

Great tour, Lorcan!!!. What else can I say? Highly recommend! Lorcan was entertaining, insightful, and highly informative. I went in knowing very little about the rebellion and left with a deep appreciation for the struggle and sacrifice of many generations of Irish men and women. Lorcan is a fantastic guide and an enormously kind and funny person! Forget about all the tourist busses, if you really want to know about Dublin's history from below, there can't be any other choice than him. Thank you for the experience, comrade. Great tour by a world class tour guide! Lorcan kept us enthralled. Told in a witty manner that was easy to understand, I could have listened to him all day. A++"
2,Arthur Guinness Dwelling House,5.0,"Who would think ""Guinness Beer"" at that time?"
3,Big Bus Tours Dublin,4.875,"Jerry (Gerry?) was a GREAT driver!!!!  The bus takes you by many historical places and his commentary (and singing) was wonderful.  The other two drivers were okay.  Seats were small for a larger person. Staff were very helpful with my disabled husband.  If we weren't so tired we would have ridden around a couple times just to be sure we saw everything.  This was a great way for us to do something productive while waiting to check into our hotel. Me and my husband just came back from Dublin and we got a 48hr ticket included the night tour. All the drivers we had were brilliant funny stories lots of information especially Robbie and Brian definitely recommend this bus tour. We did the whole tour then jumped on and off the rest of the time great service. It was incredibly helpful to experience all the sights of Dublin, especially when time was limited. The audio recordings provided clarity without being dull, and when we switched buses, Paul, our guide, was remarkably engaging, injecting humor while highlighting important landmarks worth stopping at. The app, which allowed us to track stops and schedules, proved invaluable in maximizing our visit to Dublin. I loved it!!!
Yes, there is couple of details to improve but it doesn't take back the fact that I did enjoy it and Big Bus Dublin have a great Tours offer and have a really welcoming and friendly Drivers/Guides combination. Ali (Hop-on Hop-off knowledgeable driver), Jerry (Fabolous knowledgeable and fun Coastal driver), Ros (Fun and fresh speaker Night Tour) and Albert (Night Tour driver).
100% Recommended. Ross was an absolutely fantastic guide very knowledgeable and uproariously funny. Our driver Lee was also very professional and had a great report with the guide. We were gonna just ride the bus for a bit and hop off but once we heard Ross and his enthusiasm we had to ride the whole tour with him start at stop 1 and make sure you get Ross (Don't ask about Rachel) Incredible !!!
We did the coastal tour , 40 min drive to the cliffs and then to the small village of Howth.
During the stops you have time to explore the locations and take some nice pictures and eat something.
Our tour guide Robbie and he was amazing and also very funny.
Well deserved 5 stars review! 
By the way we used our Dublin pass from Go City We had a great time in the bus, especially with guides Alan and Brian who were brilliant. My wheelchair was accommodated and I rode for free, the stops were easy to find and if you download the app it's very helpful. The only disappointment was that there is a long wait at stop one when changing over buses which was not explained when buying tickets and getting on at stop 7. The App was very helpful in determining when the next bus would come. Live guides. We were on 3 different buses. All of the buses were very clean. The guides were all very friendly,  efficient and safe drivers in very busy Dublin traffic. They were all very easy to understand.  The tour was only offered in English. The ticket is good for 24 hours. The map on the flyer was also very helpful."
4,Blessington Street Basin,4.75,"Amazing small place to have a rest, read or have a small picnic. It had shade, an amazing view.
It's not in the most amazing neighborhood but nobody bothered us Very nice place, quiet in the evening, perfect for a little walk to see the birds without fear. Beautiful little park and lake in the Phibsborough area of Dublin. It's well maintained and a real haven for wildlife. There's a pretty little gate lodge at the main entrance to the park. Marvelous park! It's so relaxing the sound of water so peaceful! Different kinds of birds and trees around! It's nice for a walk or just to sit down and read a book or just watch the birds and water! Loved it! Sweet little park. If you are in this area, definitely pop in to see the flowers. The plants are all blooming for spring already and the ducks are fun to watch. The walled garden is just a nice place to visit and obviously well loved. Lovely little space to spend your lunch break in. You wouldn't know you were in the city once in here. It is so peaceful. It was lovely to see the family of swans,various ducks and the big bird, is it a heron? not sure, and plenty of gicknahs(pigeons). Lovely little path around a water reservoir with the sound of fountains, quacking of ducks n ducklings. 1 lap of the path is 400m; 5 laps makes 2km; 10 laps-4km. Benches along the path, paintings on the stone walls, little fairy doors, swans in the water, colourful flowering shrubs all around, little bronze sculpture in the walls Always beautiful regardless of the weather. Maintained by creative hardworking friendly staff. And a bird sanctuary right here in town. Then there's one of those posh markets on Fridays. Lovely buzz about the place."
5,Chancery Park,4.0,"Gorgeous park with a massive beautiful church. Love the water fountain, the brown ish building behind, and the cute little park at the corner. It's a wonderful place to relax and release some stress after work.
There is a tram cafe there as well to enjoy such calming experience  to the fullest. A ""pocket"" park in the begining of the Chancery Str.
Protected by raillings it has two entrance doors.
The fountain in the middle offers is the greater surprise to the passerby. It is impressive how neatly clean the park is kept. I stayed five days at the near by hotel and never saw someone sitting on the three iron cast benches on the one side of the fountain! No matter what the park adds a nice brush to the surrounding area! It matches well with the brick built houses very close at the Ormond square. The benches are v nice and there's a lovely fountain too Today I was more than surprised by the fact that I could enter this nice little park. The park is an extension of Chancery House, a block of Art Deco style council built flats designed in 1934 by the then city housing architect, Herbert Simms.

My understanding has been that the park was locked most of the time because of anti-social activity in the area.

Today I discovered that a number of parks in the area have been re-opened to the public but in the case of Chancery Park access is limited to a few hours a day [8 hours Mon-Tues and 4 hours on Fridays with no access at weekends].

Maybe if enough people visit the hours may be extended. Small park with a small bit of history attached. It was a quiet spot in a busy area. Nice. An amazing little park to relax. It has a water fountain. Well maintained garden. I live in the area its a quite little community ive lived in chancery house since I was 12/13 & im 44this June love the area &everything is on your doorstep luas buses trains & the city centre town Absolutely beautiful little park, meet a lovely lady with her little dog, so peaceful in the had to believe it was in the city"
6,Chillest Bench,5.0,"Traveled from the U.S. to experience the chillness of this bench. The reviews were all correct. This was in fact the chillest bench that has ever graced my cheeks. 10/5 would recommend Took a nine hour flight to see the Chillest Bench, did not disappoint. I even got to talking with the waiter, a little grey feathery fellow, and the stories he had were inspiring!! I went to chill on this bench , but I didn't realise it was the chill bench . Was supposed to only chill , lay low for about 10 mins. I ended up leaving the bench after 30 mins giggling with my eyes pure red . I strongly recommend prebooking a spot on the bench . I had to wait in line for about 15 mins to chill . Got really lucky and managed to get a seat in 15 minutes, should have pre-booked. Bench is extremely chill, great place for a cigarette and or a sandwich. I don't smoke but if I did I would on this very bench. I ended up drinking lucozade sport orange flavour with two of my friends. The view of the Samuel becket bridge, Dublin skyline, and light breeze make it undoubtedly the chilliest bench in Dublin. Hella chill bench... Almost missed my bus to the airport because i was so chill. 10/10, came here after having lunch at Eddie Rocket's and it was very chill. Never forget this bench , used to walk past it on way to work in 2004. Beautiful view, chill bench, can't improve on it"
7,Christ Church Cathedral,4.625,"Ruth Kennedy was our wonderful and very knowledgeable tour guide. This is a beautiful and educational tour of a historic sight in Dublin. There were children in our group and Ruth tried to keep them entertained as well which was very helpful. You can also rent audio equipment and do a self guided at your own pace tour. The audio could be helpful if you are hard of hearing. Wonderful gift shop also available for beautiful keepsakes and souvenirs. The cathedral is a magnificent one. Beautiful stain-glass windows. It has a larger crypt with lot of old artificets. Marvellous floor and Marbles statues. It has a good pipe organ, and a lot of antiques. Worth a visit. Please check the entrance times online - we stop by one day and it was closed for a three hour. And we're not able to get back till three days later. It was well worth it it was Friday morning not too big of a crowd walk right here but we did have to pay an entrance fee, as well as at Saint Patrick's Cathedral which was a little surprising as many cathedral throughout Europe are free to enter. But it was beautiful inside and great to walk around and look at everything and then go to the dungeons The cathedral has a Irish charm ans is absolutely rich with history. The audio guide is done very well with multiple paths you can take at each stop. The crypt is very cool to check out and is the oldest structure in Dublin.

It's a bit pricy for for the tour, as it's rather plain by European cathedral standards. We went in the evening. It's beautiful from inside. The priests were saying their words from the holy book. It quite big We walked in and there was no waiting to purchase is self-guided tour ticket. We took our time and were able to finish the tour in about an hour.

They had 3:00 (15:00) Mass going on which added a nice touch to the tour.
They offer guided tours for a higher price as well as family, student, and senior pricing.

The stained glass windows throughout were amazing! Visited as a music venue today.
Acoustics were very pleasing.
Saw much architectural excellence that entices me to return. We went for the 5pm service, so we didn't pay anything to get in. We enjoyed visiting the church and learning about its history. They have costumes we can wear, so of course we loved the props."
8,City Kayaking,5.0,"A truly unique experience! I highly recommend this activity. It's great for beginners and for those with more experience! Our tour guide Jonathan was so friendly and the musician we had,  Fin, was very good! We will definitely be downloading his music!! A great way to learn about the history of Dublin whilst seeing it from a unique location. Guide was highly knowledgeable and engaging. Highly recommend! This is one of the best gigs I have attended in my life. Amazing kayak trip, very easy and friendly, but overall, it was absolutely phenomenal to hear the acoustic under O'Connel bridge. Thank you so much! I literally came to Dublin for this unique experience and it didn't disappoint! As a child I'd seen a picture of someone kayaking through the city and it ended up being my very first impression of Dublin. It was a rare rainy and windy day in Dublin's summer but Mr Jonathan still managed to help us beginners have a smooth and fun ride, all while happily sharing his abundant information about Dublin I'd never known before! It offered a perspective you can't get just by walking around the city and I'm so glad I finally managed to fulfil this dream of mine. Really fun activity for anyone, you don't have to be particularly fit and the activity is suitable for families. (If you do want to go a bit harder, you can too). I thought the tour was informative and definitely original. The staff was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Great experience all around We were blessed with a lovely evening but I would've enjoyed it if it was raining! I went with my 13 year old daughter and she adored it.

Great staff who made the event enjoyable, paddling wasn't too challenging and the music under the arches was magical. Would definitely recommend, it was a brilliant two hours. A wonderful way to spend our first evening in Dublin. We took the musical tour under the bridges. A seal joined us for part of the trip! Really nice activity to see the city from a different point of view. Friendly staff and good equipment. During the paddling there is a guy from staff with boat that take picture of you for free. Highly recommended. But bring a spare clothes with you!"
9,Collins Day Tours-Dublin,5.0,"I had a wonderful day in Wicklow & Kilkenny! Our tourguide Pat did such a lovely job! He's really passionate and had some really interest facts about the Irish Countryside. I recommend the tour to everyone especially with Pat and his lovely driver A! Pat the tour guide and Bart the driver were amazing. Pat was friendly, welcoming, and very informative the entire tour. He even went out of his way to chat with everyone 1:1 before the tour ended to see if we had any questions he could answer. He gave us great recommendations on other attractions in the area. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Dublin! I cannot say enough good things about Collins Day Tours! Our guide for that day was Pat, and Alec was the driver. Everything was so smooth and organized. Pat is a natural storyteller and you can tell just how much he loves and appreciates his homeland. He really knows his history. We had the perfect amount of time at Glendalough, and the drive through Wicklow National Park was beautiful. Kilkenny was a great stop as well, as the people with me were dying to visit a castle! And on top of all that, he even brought the good weather. ;) Definitely worth your day and money to book! It was a great day with tourguide Pat. He has vast knowledge of the Irish history and great stories so the ride in the coach goes by in no time. Thank you for this great trip, would highly recommend to do this for a day. I cannot stress this enough - Pat was THE BEST tour guide I've ever had! This guy went above and beyond anything a tourist needs to enjoy a field trip. He talked about everything that may interest us without being monotone or boring. His partner was Bart, an excellent bus driver with driving skills. Huge plus is their sense of humour and warm personality. Highly recommend! Went to kilkenny  and Glendalough. A trip worthwhile. The guide, Dermot, went above and beyond. He covered the whole Irish history, the places where we stopped and anything in between. Complete package with live songs and funny episodes. I just feel the trip could be longer.
Any trip with Dermot should be worth while. Our tour was with Dermot. Great guide. Very friendly and prepared to teach us about the trip and about Ireland. I apreciated the rigor
with the schedules. I would totally recomend this tour and guide. Pat the tour guide was enthusiastic, funny and made the trip a blast. You can feel his love for the people and the history above all. Would take a tour from him anywhere! And Alec the bus driver was a fantastic driver."
10,Custom House Visitor Centre,4.5,"Inexpensive and informative but also just not a very visually or materially impressive self-guided tour An absolute gem on Dublin's past that I didn't know exist before actually walking into it. The exhibition relies on text and a few well made videos with a handful of artifacts, so you'll want to join the guided tour for a full (and often private!) storytelling experience. So much to cover the tour can go far beyond one hour. Tony is a brilliant guide, sharing with us the history with a bit of personal stories. A great place to learn about the recent history of Dublin and Ireland that leads up to the free state. Heading to EPIC and just happened to pop in. Inexpensive tickets, short tour, but invaluable to understanding the Revolutionary experience. Highly recommend! Thirteen most significant ""Rivers of Ireland"" emblazon the external architecture of The Custom House built in 1687 yet today only the Munster Blackwater has a sustainable salmon run. Just back from a guided tour with out Autusm class. Guide Harry absolutely amazing and his presentation had our students enthralled.  Great day and experience.  Thanks to all Just had a mesmerizing experience starting at The Customs House Visitors Centre thoroughly enhanced by the wonderful Dublin Discovery Trails app which allowed me to witness the burning of the Customs House in 1921 through virtual reality. Dublin Discovery Trails helps to guide you on a journey of discovery to some of the City's most loved sites and attractions, enabling you to uncover compelling stories of Dublin's culture, heritage and history via themed GPS- enabled walking trails and augmented reality tours. 10 of Dublin's most famous statues have been given the gift of the gab! Pass a Talking Statue, swipe your smartphone on a nearby plaque and presto, get a call back from James Joyce (written by Roddy Doyle and voiced by Gabriel Byrne), Oscar Wilde (written by John Banville and voiced by Andrew Scott), or Fidelity on the O'Connell Monument (written by Paula Meehan and voiced by Ruth Negga)! Each has a story to tell. Together, they tell Dublin's story. From Brendan Gleeson, Eoin Colfer to Brendan O'Carroll and Brenda Fricker, the array of Irish talent is there for all to hear on your very own personal phonecall and piece of Dublin History. A thoroughly compelling use of today's technology to remind us of our cultural heritage. Great spot to get a precis on the building of the Custom House and it's role in Irish history.

Particularly recommend the short movie on the burning of the building during the War of Independence Just after enjoying an incredible tour with the wonderful Yvonne. 100% worth a visit to get some insight and knowledge on such an important and significant part of the Dublin skyline."
11,Dalton's Musical History Tour,5.0,"A superb personalized ballad, enchanted and in song, which changes the spirit of a classic visit. Let yourself walk with Fiona. Mary Poppins 2024. I wish her great success.

A superb personalized ballad, enchanted and in song, which changes the spirit of a classic visit. Let yourself walk with Fiona. Mary Poppins 2024. I wish her great success. We arranged to experience the tour as a group, and it was a lot of fun. Fiona was energetic and easy to follow (despite having to shout over occasional traffic), has a fantastic singing voice, and had a great set of historic points to talk about. She even got us to sing along for some of them - we didn't know all of the songs but singing along to the ones we did was tons of fun. Highly recommended! nan nan"
12,DoDublin Bus Tours,5.0,"We were so pleased we chose to do the Do Dublin tour!!  Our bus driver, John, was an absolute legend!  Very informative and extremely funny!  Great way to get about and learn about the landmarks and history of the city! Probably the best hop on hop off tour we have ever done, commentary can unusually be heard so clearly through the loud speakers in the bus, no need for earphones, drivers had a great sense of humour
Definitely well worth the 30 euros Best bus tour!! Jer was a legend, full of knowledge, good laugh and voice of an angel!! Glad we picked green over red!!  What a great tour bus experience! I have made a habit of using tour buses in cities that I visit, but this one is the best by far. The kids , as well as the adults, absolutely loved the Live commentary. So funny, informative and helpful. We had a 48hour ticket, so had the pleasure to hear many different Drivers/guides, Bill, Sean, John and Jay, all Amazing! (Hope I got all the names and right) Thank you! The bus was on time and the bus driver was knowledgeable, positive, and friendly. Even if you like to walk everywhere, it's fun to hop on the bus to see the city from a different vantage point. It was an experience in itself. The bus tour was great! It gives you some vouchers, discounts and free entry into a couple of bits so definitely worth checking before you start you visit if you were going to do anything they include anyway! Takes you all round the city so really good if you wanted to look at places a bit further out, you can use it as travel but also have some great commentary on your journey. The tour guides we had were hilarious! It definitely made the journey fun! We got the 48 hour pass as not much more than the 24hr and you can use it as much as you want! Would 100% recommend, so glad we chose this!! Made the trip what it was! We wouldn't have done a couple of the things we did has we not been on this tour! This tour is really good even for natives like me. It's my second time doing it the last time was in 2016. I had my 12yr old son and 5yr old daughter with me. My son found it really interesting and took loads of photos but after about an hour  my daughter said ""this is a bit boring for me""! That's understandable though. We didn't get the full benefit of it we just stayed and did the tour rather than hop on and off which I would recommend doing. It was a very hot day and the driver told me how hot it can get up the top recommending suncream which we had. Really enjoyed this hop on-hop off tour! It was a great way to see the city and learn about the highlights. We had a couple different drivers, but the best by far was Richie! He was great. So friendly, lively and fun!"
13,Dubh Linn Garden,4.875,"the flowers at the garden are stunning. i've been here in different times of the year and i have to say, flowers make a big difference :) the sculptures are also great to see. the park is a real gem hidden in
the historic area. Absolutely gorgeous garden right outside of Dublin Castle--so much so that I enjoyed it more than the castle itself. Definitely was very crowded since the weather was nice, but everyone seems to respect the sense of peace and quiet. Very special spot during sunny days, I loved and recommend. The is a Lovely coffee shop attached to... Very beautiful and detailed gardens....if i am not mistaken there is also a cafe where you can get sth to eat and sit there to relax... the garden is so stunning and well maintained! situated right next to the castle you are able to great some great views! The Dubh Linn Garden in Dublin is a tranquil and historic green space situated behind Dublin Castle, one of the city's most important landmarks. The name ""Dubh Linn"" translates to ""black pool"" in Irish, referring to a dark tidal pool that was once located at the confluence of the River Liffey and the River Poddle, where the garden now lies. This pool is believed to be the origin of Dublin's name.

The garden itself is a serene oasis in the heart of Dublin, offering a peaceful retreat from the bustling city streets. It is beautifully landscaped with lush lawns, manicured flowerbeds, and a variety of trees and shrubs, creating an inviting environment for visitors to relax and enjoy nature. The central lawn is often used for public events and gatherings, contributing to the cultural vibrancy of the area.

One of the key features of Dubh Linn Garden is its intricate Celtic knot design, which can be best appreciated from above. This striking pattern reflects Ireland's rich heritage and adds a unique visual element to the garden. Pathways meander through the garden, inviting visitors to explore and discover its beauty from different angles.

The garden is also home to several sculptures and art installations, enhancing its aesthetic appeal and providing points of interest for art enthusiasts. Among these is the ""Garden of Remembrance"" sculpture, which commemorates the lives lost during Ireland's struggle for independence.

Dubh Linn Garden is easily accessible from Dublin Castle, making it a convenient stop for tourists exploring the city's historical and cultural sites. It serves as a peaceful complement to the castle's grand architecture and storied past, offering a quiet place for reflection amidst the historical grandeur.

Visitors to Dubh Linn Garden can enjoy a leisurely stroll, a quiet moment of contemplation, or a picnic on the lawn, all while surrounded by the garden's natural beauty and historical significance. Its location within the Dublin Castle complex also makes it an ideal spot for those looking to delve deeper into the history of Dublin while enjoying a serene environment.

Overall, Dubh Linn Garden is a hidden gem in Dublin, combining historical importance with natural beauty. It provides a refreshing escape from the urban hustle and bustle, making it a must-visit for both tourists and locals seeking a peaceful and picturesque retreat in the heart of the city. Beautiful little garden.
We can go around there.

The only point that could spoil it are the cranes, visible, located behind it. Super well maintained and beautiful garden with stunning views of the castle."
14,Dublin Castle,4.75,"We spent 1,5 hours there with a self guided tour and enjoyed it! They provide interesting information and historical facts in every room. Also we were surprised to meet a music festival in the castle yard so we enjoyed it too.
Guided tours were all sold out on Saturday midday. Awesome place to visit. The written guide is enough to immerse yourself in the history of this castle and every room is majestic and beautiful. Amazing atmosphere everywhere. Definitely worth a visit to get to know Ireland a bit better and to see some pieces of art. The tour will take you around 1 hour. You can buy the tickets onsite without any problems if you don't go during weekends. A must visit if you are interested in Irish history. We were lucky enough to have a guide with us who was very knowledgeable and able to bring the history alive. The castle area itself is lovely to walk around and there is a cafe, a museum and small bookshop. It is free to enter and there are toilet facilities. If you like art this is your place, each room of the castle has beautiful paintings and small amount of history written on a sign. The castle is very walkable. My family and I only did the self guided tour and we got to see a lot but there were a few perks more if you do the guided tour. It's a cheap get away from the hustle. Dublin Castle is a must-visit historical gem in the heart of the city! This iconic landmark spans over 800 years of Irish history, offering a fascinating glimpse into Ireland's past. The guided tour is absolutely worth it - knowledgeable guides bring the castle's rich history to life with engaging stories and lesser-known facts. From the medieval tower to the opulent State Apartments, every corner exudes historical significance. The beautiful gardens provide a tranquil escape from the busy city. Don't miss the underground excavation site showcasing Viking and medieval Dublin. Whether you're a history buff or just curious, Dublin Castle delivers an enriching, unforgettable experience. A true highlight of any Dublin visit!                 Dublin castle is a nice visit. I visited on a Wednesday and got a free tour to my surprise. Not sure how it happened. The guided tour will take you to places like the life chapel and gunpowder tower which you cannot visit self guided. It was the seat of 750 years of British rule in Ireland. And many historical events took place here. The Irish presidents are sworn to the office here Nice looking structure located at a square, very vibrant and easy walking distance to other areas of the city center. There's free self guided tours inside. A beautiful piece of history here in Dublin.
The castle and palace have multiple rooms that are opulent and beautiful, and tons of artwork to enjoy.
We spent about 1 hour wandering through the castle and enjoying the interesting furniture, decor, art pieces, and history associated with each room.
A guided tour is available for a small increase in ticket price (4 euros), but the self guided tour with the directory is also informative and enjoyable.
There is a nice garden to relax in behind the castle, and entrance to the garden is free."
15,Dublin City,4.75,"Great place hamel available all clothing stores, brands, products pharmacy ice cream, restaurants and bars clean streets spread carda feels reassured and offer help to people so really good Must visit!! Nice Good Several works by world-class painters, as well as some Dubliners, it's worth spending a few hours in the Gallery, and having a coffee on the interior terrace... It is a beautiful and wonderful place Very nice, sociable city More than wonderful"
16,Dublin Discovered Boat Tours,4.5,"We had a great time. We learned 1,000 years of Irish history in 45 minutes. Ryan & Captain Tony were amazing. This is a must when you visit Dublin! I decided to do the tour the day before folowing the canselation of a business meeting. Although the day was gloomy and the temperature was a bit cold the tour guide succeded in chearing up all people on board. It was a very nice experience. The tour was smooth and we viewed the city along the Liffey banks from the river point of view. We were provided with much and good information about the city history and the development of the Docklands area. The guide had a very good sence of houmor and kept balance not being insulting or vulgar. I really enjoyed the tour. The staff was very friendly and the tour was informative as well as funny. It was interesting. However, the tour was just about half an hour instead of 45 min. I hope this was a one-off due to the tide or similar. I do feel like we should have gotten some sort of explanation or an apology though. Our tour was cut short by 1/3... The tour was very interesting. A lot of Irish history in 45min. We had a good laugh with the guide!
Would definitely recommend on a city trip! Had a great time with Gerry and Tony.  It was a fun experience with a beautiful view of the city from the river.  I also appreciate that Caitriona treated me very well via email in regard to scheduling my visit. A great Dublin experience. The boat stories were amazing, the guide was great!
What really impressed me is this: they called us to tell that the place from where the boat was changed, but because we were distracted by the number format we did not answer and did now know that boat left from another place (river level issues). So, when we got to the kiosk and told the lady we do not see any boat, she explained what happened and proposed us to go on the next tour, 1h later, which was also the last one that day. Good place to eat recommendations too! Very easy going, natural, a good customer orientation and diplomacy. All my respects!  you really made a difference! Guide only in English, I didn't understand everything, especially the witticisms that made the passengers laugh. So-so. A translation with headphones, for example, would be a significant minimum for a tourist trip. Not very interesting for small children. Good for adults anyway"

18,Dublin History and Culture Tour,5.0,"Fascinating insights into Irish History and Dublin  - We walked and talked for almost 3 hours with Keith, a proud Dubliner and knowledgeable historian. We definitely recommend his tour, especially at the start of a visit. He took us through Ireland's story from the NorseGaels to the progressive present. We not only learned about the Dublin sites, but also the language, history, culture, politics, struggles and successes of Ireland through the ages. In fact, now we know why an Irish speaker would struggle with the ""th"" in through. Keith explained the enormous influence of the Irish on the culture and language of the rest of the world. Our time with him flew by."
19,Dublin Portal,4.5,"A video link between Dublin and New York that feels like a slice of the future. There's no sound but that makes you have to get more creative if you want to communicate across the Atlantic. It's a well chosen spot for Dublin as the Spire is in the immediate background. Best yet, this screen never turns off so it is on 24/7/365 so basically an infinite live stream. I visited the portal today, and it worked. There is a line on the ground - if you stay behind it, people in New York will see you completely. If you come too close to the portal, only the top of your head will be visible (so we were told by a friendly guy who seemed to be something like an overseer). It's a fun activity.  Very cool, it shows us what technology can do nowadays, the people on the other side were very nice. 10/10 if you're visiting you should go. Spectacular place, and very good for connecting people across the world. Very well built. Make sure you stand in the visible area when you communicate with New York. It's not how it's built, it's the people on the other side that make it special. Cool idea, but in practice, it's a large free face time which give the opportunity to some who do not know how to behave in public to do their nonsense It's a nice idea to connect people around the world, but for me it actually felt a bit boring because the people in New York seemed to do not care at all about the portal.  It's a video conference from Dublin to New York. We cannot communicate with them by gestures, not by words, they cannot hear us Very exciting idea behind it, even if many non-tech-believers don't consider it serious, or some people don't respect it. It has a future in it. I consider it very interesting and also important for Ireland. This advancing country."
20,Dublin Tour Guide,5.0,"One of the best tours ever.  Ciaran is a true student of history and could put the sites in the context of events of the time.  His knowledge of Irish history was matched only by his charm and easy demeanor.  Just a great day and I can highly recommend Ciaran to anyone that wants to understand what makes Ireland Ireland. We had a lovely time with Leonor. She gave us a great overview of Irish history, James Joyce and Dublin in general and adapted the tour perfectly to our wishes. The tour with Leonor really added something special to our stay in Dublin. We would definitely recommend! There aren't enough words to describe how incredible this tour company is. Ultimate Day in Dublin! James Joyce, General post office,  book of Kells and old library at trinity college, national gallery (where we saw works by Keating, Van Gogh, Picasso, and Monet), first Irish fish and chips at Lincoln Inn, dublin castle,  Irish cheeses from a cheese monger to pair with beers at the oak!! Ended the evening at an Irish pub with live music of course. Garvan was an amazing guide and made us feel truly special. We did the new Irish History Museum Tour with John Caffrey when we were in Dublin.  I have used Dublin Tour Guide before on previous trips to Dublin.  This tour was fantastic.  John's knowledge of Irish History and art was extensive with respect to significant historical events that shaped Ireland.  I highly recommend Dublin Tour Guide and this tour when you are in Dublin. This was a great find. I can't recommend this tour highly enough. We went on the pub crawl tour with our amazing and knowledgeable tour guide Brendan (not O'Leary) who walked us through the pubs of Dublin. I would go again tomorrow if I knew Brendan would be the one giving the tour.
Four very different pubs that showcase all the best that Dublin has to offer. My wife and I took a tour of Dublin with Garvan. He was extremely knowledgeable and easy to talk to. Garvan took us to major locations/sites such as Trinity College and The Book of Kells but also gave us multiple options along the way so it felt like our needs were being catered to. We had never been to Dublin before so this was a fantastic way to learn about the rich history and culture. We highly recommend this tour. In August 2019, we took what turned out to be truly the trip of a lifetime and packed our bags, headed for England, 'Scotland,  Wales, and especially to Ireland.  We were on a Grand European Tours, with only a day and half in Dublin.  My husband insisted, for my sake, that we book a Dublin walking tour,  so we started looking for recommendations. Dublin Tour Guide, particularly Garvan Rusche, was recommended, and what a wonderful decision! Garvan was so passionate about Irish history, and was willing to work with us, listening to what we wanted to see and making it happen! Seeing The Book of Kells was the highlight of the trip,  as well as just walking around the city, soaking up Garvan's knowledge and his take on life in Ireland!  Dublin Tour guide - super highly recommended. Great tour for our student. It made Dublin even more interesting and beautiful. Great humour, nice locations and good time. Recommended"
21,Dublin Tourism Centre,4.5,"Dublin city offering a unique experience and stunning city views both day and night, We were very well informed about visits to do in Dublin in both English and French. It's a real plus to go there. Nobody spoke French! Very friendly staff, everything was perfect We booked 48 hours for the Big Bus. You can then enjoy this hop-on hop-off service for 2 days + you will receive a free evening tour and city tour.

What makes these buses unique: the live commentary from the bus drivers.

James is a real chatterbox. He knows a lot about the city and his many anecdotes make him laugh.

Anne also knew a lot about the city. She also sang suitable songs along the way!

Unfortunately, Gerry didn't say anything live: he played a tape with lyrics. Gerry was also very irritated towards traffic.

The employees at the office center were very friendly and helpful.
The employee at bus stop 1 (Collin) was very nice and happy to talk about Dublin. Very friendly, very helpful. Thanks! The service was very helpful. Open every day."
22,Dublin Tourist Information Centre Barnardo Square,4.5,"Cesar was our information guide. His Knowledge is outstanding. He gave us heaps of ideas to see lots of Ireland on our road trip from Australia.  Thank you I was so happy to find the real tourist information ! Cesar and his colleague were really nice and gave me information that I needed about transport. They were patient and clear. I  recommend. St Patrick's Day parade goes right past the building with a big square for people to gather and enjoy the festivities. 2 double decker busses blocking the view reserved for ""media only"" kids having to watch the parade through the windows of the bus while the busses remained pretty much unoccupied. sacrifice for many to favor the few. It's a terrible shame this is allowed to happen. Just perfect. Very very well helped by the two members of staff (the Irish woman and the Belgian with long hair). Help with pleasure, kindness and valuable advice! The best pleac i visited if you like crowded area and best restaurant specially Nando Cesar was such an absolute  gem to come upon.  He provided so much great information to us as first timers to Dublin.  He even told us where the closest ATM was so that we could finally get some Euros.  He was so kind, helpful and professional.  He really loves his job and that just has set the tone for our trip and of the people of Ireland  in general! I stopped by the info center at the start of my short Irish trip, and I was greeted warmly by the staff.
Cesar was not just kind but also extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He gave me paper maps in my language for Dublin and the other Irish cities I wanted to explore. Plus, he dished out tons of cool suggestions for Dublin's must-see spots and some hidden gems, all while answering my questions about the city.
He's a real Irish expert, and his passion for the place shines through in his words.

Needless to say, I followed his advice and thoroughly loved my Irish holiday!
I look forward to coming back sometime in the future! The staff are absolutely lovely kind and make you feel so at ease. Maps hop on tours and public transport They made sure we get value for money. That are a credit to the organisation. Well done kind regards B."
23,Dublin Tourist Information Centre O'Connell Street,5.0,"Staff like the welcoming, caring and smiling Irish people, I had an excellent stay and I would come back!  Small mention of Caesar's sympathy, which deserves to be highlighted.... Super nice people, very welcoming. I had all the information I needed.
I will come back without hesitation Very helpful. You can purchase you tourist leap card from here Very competent staff attentive to tourists and very friendly Dublin was a great place to visit, beautyful places, lots of histories and very kind people! Wow, wow, wow. 5 stars for Min Lin's professionalism, clarity, and kindness. Not only did she give me maps with everything I needed, she also gave me interesting facts and pieces of advice for my upcoming Wicklow Way hike. Thanks to her, my journey around Ireland is already a A LOT smoother. My first impression of Ireland is very positive, thanks to her. Welcomed by a young French-speaking man named Cesar. A marvel... both for the smile, the friendliness and the perfect advice for our research... Visit to free monuments and unmissable places and pubs with local people. Thanks to him. We had a great day and he had a lot to do with it. Very helpfull good service.great job
Thanks"
24,Dublin Unlocked | Private tours | Private chauffeur | Walking Tours Services - Dublin,4.625,"I have taken many tours with Jim and all of them have been 5 stars. He seems to know every ring fort, passage tomb, photo opportunity, quality food producer and story in Ireland. His tours are really good value for money as you get way more than the tour description. I can't recommend Jim Dempsey Tour Guide highly enough. Energetic, enthusiastic, knowledgable and funny... exactly what you'd want for a tour in Dublin/Ireland! Haha, found you on the map! Strongly recommend Jim as a professional tour guide and a wonderful host! Amazing! Loved it nan nan nan"
25,Dublin Zoo,4.75,"Dublin Zoo offers a delightful experience for visitors of all ages. From the moment we entered, it was evident that the zoo is meticulously maintained, with immaculate pathways and well-kept enclosures. The cleanliness of the facilities added to the overall enjoyment of our visit.

While exploring the zoo, we encountered a variety of fascinating animals. However, we were disappointed that we couldn't catch a glimpse of some of the more elusive species such as the lion, snow leopard, and tiger. Despite this, we were thrilled to see magnificent creatures like the giraffes, elephants, and California sea lions. Their habitats appeared spacious and enriched, providing a comfortable environment for the animals.

The highlight of our visit was observing the playful antics of the giraffes and the graceful movements of the elephants. The California sea lion exhibit was also captivating, offering insight into the lives of these charismatic marine mammals.

Overall, our experience at Dublin Zoo was enjoyable, especially on a day with good weather. Although we missed out on seeing a few animals, the cleanliness of the zoo and the opportunity to witness captivating species made it a memorable outing. We look forward to returning in the future to explore more of what Dublin Zoo has to offer. Big fan of the big enclosures for animals. For sure the biggest I've seen in any zoo so far.

This however does mean that it's often hard to find out even see the animals, especially from up close.

Wouldn't recommend going here if you're going because you like photography and are looking to get some cool shots because there's little options for free shots without (dirty) glass or wired fences.

The bigger enclosures also mean that There's not as many different animals as in other zoos, and that was a small disappointment.

Overall good experience, but could be more interactive, and maybe at some places possible to see the animals better. Loved this zoo! Large and full of some great animals with most being very visible. You can bet very close to the animals which is very nice! The only thing I didn't prefer were the enclosures in the middle where you have to backtrack to get back to where there are additional animals to see. Dublin Zoo has a lot to see and do for everyone! It is a large zoo with a huge variety of animals, ranging from Californian Sea Lions (not seals people, sea lions) red pandas, Asian elephants, both African and Asian lions to a basic petting zoo! Great place to go and I'd recommend buying your tickets beforehand.

Plenty of food places dotted around, water bottle refil stations and facilities. A wonderful well established and cared for zoo. Put on your walking shoes as this is a very big zoo and well worth a visit, you can spend the whole day there. It's beautiful.  Great value for money! The restaurants have great food and there's plenty of places to stop, rest and view the great many animals from around the world. Had been there with my girlfriend to experience zoo after a decade.
The zoo was amazing to be honest and the way they have kept it for the animals is brilliant. Every animal have their space to walk and move freely along with dedicated areas to come closer to audience separated by glass walls.
I personally liked Red Pandas and Sea Lions the most.
We have lunch at Meerkat restaurant alongside watching Meerkat and was an amazing day for us.
This place is highly recommended and a must visit for solo, couple and especially for families. I am sure everyone will enjoy it while having a healthy walk inside the zoo. Had a great visit to the zoo, managed to see most of the animals while we were there.  Felt the environment was really good, lots of space for the animals to relax and enjoy. Credit to all involved. Would love to visit again sometime. Keep up the good work. A little cooler today ,so not as much activity as normal. A great spot to put the day in..plenty for the kids , coffee bars , vending machines,  loads of places to sit and chill ..you can even have a puff in the smoking areas ."
26,Dublin city walks,5.0,"Top notch walking tour of Dublin with Liam!  He is very knowledgeable and pleasant.  Superb overview of Dublin history and culture.  We explored Dublin's Viking, Norman, and Georgian past capped by Irish liberation in 2.5 hours.  I look forward to returning for a literary tour. Liam is a fantastic tour guide! My husband and I really enjoyed his literary tour of Dublin. Liam Greene is an excellent, interesting, humorous guide. Highly recommend!"
27,Dublinia,4.875,"Great place for a brief retrospect and reflection of Dublin and it's colorful history. They put hard work into the setup, and it's really worth visiting. There's a neat little coffee shop within, with very friendly staff. As a side note, the place has an elevator and is wheelchair accessible. This museum offers a fascinating journey through Dublin's Viking and Medieval history. The exhibits are highly interactive and engaging, making it perfect for both adults and children. Dublinia is a must-visit for anyone interested in history or looking for an educational and fun day out in Dublin.
Additionally, they have excavation/digging activities for kids, the kids became little archeologists. Our kid was very excited about this activity. This museum is pretty interactive. Great history of the Viking age in Ireland and you'll read a lot of interesting stories of the past. Took some friends here and they really enjoyed it! Great museum with some artifacts from Dublin's past. See, it's early years as a viking camp to its medieval times. Staff was helpful and friendly. One of those must stops for history buffs. I did not booked in advance, but honestly it was empty when I arrived and the guy selling tickets was lovely! Is a mix of museum type, interactive, reading areas, also some simulations of live conditions back then, including a lovely video of a guy that lived during the 15 or 16 century (I might be recollecting the year wrongly) and a guy that gives a live presentation of Viking attires and weapons.

Is a really instructive lil museum, you are allowed at the end to visit the top of the tower. Lots of stairs but you can see Dublin within the 4 cardinal points.

Museum connects with St. Michael Church, you can either buy tickets for both or just one place.

I regretted that didn't visit this museum before, it is straightforward, on your pace and full of lil drops of knowledge.

The shop, for me, has nothing that I would die for, I think it could do more regarding the Museum main topic, but others might disagree. Interesting museum for both children and adults. A chronological journey takes you through the Viking and even medieval times. The immersion is very successful thanks to the proximity of the scenes. Audio terminals and screens, offering several languages, allow you to understand life at the time through simple explanations or historical anecdotes. Activities are offered to children which makes the course attractive. It takes 1h30 for the visit but if you are curious, count on 2h30. Leaving the museum, you will have learned the history of Dublin from its creation to the present day; particularly interesting story. Viking & medieval museum to do with children. Some description terminals in FR. Reproduction of Viking weapons, Viking village and also medieval village with reconstruction of a bourgeois residence of the time. Some friendly and patient actors/speakers for the English/French translations for the little ones so that they understand medieval professions. I recommend  Really interesting museum about the Viking era in Dublin. Worth a visit - entry is EUR15 per adult"
28,EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum,4.625,"A very indepth look at Irish people, their immigration, history, and their influence on the world. Lots of facts and interactive exhibits rich with personal stories and history. Well worth a few hours on one of those rainy Dublin days. Highly recommend. We were in Dublin and wanted to learn more about the country and culture. So we decided to go to the epic museum. Although tickets are on the pricier side, we enjoyed the experience. They give you a travel passport that you scan at the end of each exhibit, which makes it exciting. We loved the history and wished we had more time to visit. A great museum that we'd for sure recommend to people. An unusual museum in the heart of the city. An excellent experience not to be missed when traveling to this city. We learn a lot about the emigration of the Irish which is little known to us in France. The atmosphere in the museum is great, we really feel captivated by the environment. The price remains very reasonable compared to other museums in the city. In addition, the employees will do their utmost to understand you and make themselves understood even if you speak little or no English. Little extra, the passport is stamped in each room of the museum, an additional souvenir completely free. A detour to this museum is highly recommended. Really fun and interactive museum! One of the best museum I have been to! It's great for locals and tourists and you can learn a lot with the way they design the museum. It's modern and well thought! I am really impressed by it! I highly recommend it !! Very beautiful museum!
We had a great time with our children!
An audio guide is available free of charge on the phone
Allow 2 hours of visit
Small restaurant nearby They say it takes 90 minutes to go through, but you could spend 5-6 hours easily if you want to see the self guided tour in it's entirety. Ok museum, very technologically advanced displays.  $25, for adults, $21 for Seniors. Ticket good for 10 days so don't rush for the entire viewing. In one day. Since exhibits are a waste of time and push a liberal agenda, so if that offends you, stay away. They boast a 7am to 7pm but we got their at 7 am and had to wait until 10 when they really open. If you know nothing about your past or heritage, this is a great exhibition. For those who have had an interest all their life in their past, this will be too commercial for your liking.

Great for a wet day, but challenge yourself to explore Dublin more.

Also don't get caught out in the gift shop, everything will be cheaper and available across town!

There are multiple coffee and food shops beyond the exit that is also accessible from tbe street Fascinating and unique. Take the time to see this. Highly interactive and engaging. You will get your digital fix here with no need for your phone. A must see."
29,Easter Egg Tree,4.75,"Cute!! Best tree I've seen in a long time. 10/10 would recommend, now even blossoming A lovely tree on a lovely street! Beautiful in bloom. It's a tree full of eggs. What more could you want. nan"
30,Experience Gaelic Games,5.0,"This tour was so fun and a great way to understand the history of these traditional Irish sports.  The experience has super friendly and patient trainers.  The trainers teach you the rules and skills step by step, which then allows you to play a short game.  The tour can be as intense or as relaxed as you want.  It was a very memorable experience and I would highly recommend doing this tour for an Irish experience.

The experience is about 3 hours long and you learn three sports:  the first is handball (not the same as Olympic handball - more like squash or racquetball).  Then, they teach you the rules of
hurling, which is like field hockey mixed with lacrosse mixed with baseball mixed with cricket.   The last sport they teach you is gaelic football.  That is like basketball mixed with soccer mixed with volleyball and also like American football or rugby.  They take breaks between each sport to explain the rules and give you glasses of water.  The facilities are very nice as well.

It is super interesting to learn the history of these sports, how they came to be, and how the Gaelic Athletic Association is an amateur sporting association -- in fact, it is the largest amateur sports association in the world.  Each neighborhood in Ireland has its own club, and the residents play only for their area clubs.  The association does not have any professional players - just amateur players.  They explained how previously the British would ban or restrict their ability to play these traditional sports.  Recently there has been a resurgence in these traditional sports, which is great to see right now.  The trainers also answer all of the questions you may have about any of the sports, how to play the sports,
or even about life in Ireland.

In conclusion, this experience playing Irish sports is the best and most fun way to experience your time in Ireland, especially if you are traveling with children who like to do active things while on vacation in a foreign country.  As a parent, this experience is a great alternative to indoor activities such as video games, youtube, chess, or other games you may play indoors.  I can not recommend this experience enough.  My children are still talking about the three sports even though it is over.  They will remember this experience forever and playing Gaelic sports will be a highlight of the vacation for them. Amazing day here at experience Gaelic Games. Very friendly and patient staff. Good instructions. Fun and long session of the sports. Would highly recommend coming here. Also afterwards you can walk to the popular pub near the graveyard ;-) So much fun activities! And good to know a interesting sports. The staff is so friendly. An equipments and stadium are all good! We had an excellent time learning about the traditional Irish games of Gaelic football, Hurling, and Gaelic handball.
The staff was friendly, welcoming and passionate. A great place for a group activity! We had a BLAST and learned so much too! Stephen was a great instructor and added in a lot of interesting facts about the history and culture of the games. Would recommend this to any group of any age!! 10/10 and a highlight of our Ireland road trip! Gaelic games were SO fun!! We had such a big group and they accommodated us so well. I had the best experience learning about these traditional Irish games!! Highly recommend!! Cormac and his team are amazing. Not only do they do an excellent job teaching the basics of Gaelic games in a way that allow people to understand and then participate in each sport, they help participants understand the cultural significance of Gaelic games to the people of Ireland. Amazing experience! Really good fun. Well organized and perfect for our stag group. Not all sporty but everyone got involved and worked really well. Sweated out the night before and worked up a thirst for the rest of the day. It is a full on work out. Lots of running. They provide water and have good changing facilities."
31,GAA Museum & Tours,4.875,"Dizzying moment on the roof of the legendary Croke Park stadium, guided tour of the different views from the summit.
Downside all the same, no audio guide!!
Even if you master the language of Chekespeare correctly, it is complicated to understand 100% the different anecdotes of our friendly Irish guide.
Kellogg's Skyline tour is a must!
The museum introduces us to the ancestral Gaelic sports of the locals and allows us to understand why these sports are more considered than rugby and football in the eyes of the islanders. A very interesting tour of this stadium and the museum by Liam who was a very friendly guide. A good moment The tour of Croke Park stadium takes at least one hour or maybe a little longer. Our guide was a pleasant young man and our group was small. Initially, there has to be some walking done to get to the interesting parts of the tour. Without wishing to spoil it on prospective visitors, there's a variety to the visit and if you have any knowledge or interest of GAA sports, you should find this interesting. Really enjoyed the tour, we arrived earlier and were allowed to join earlier group instead of one hour wait. Lots of happening there, like deliveries or lawn moving what makes hard to hear the guide, but still worth it. Tour is well laid out, what makes it really interesting. Visiting places that only special guests or players go to make tour special. Lovely cafeteria/restaurant at premises with good food and perfect gift shop that only has GAA stuff. Also enjoyed museum activity area like hitting the slither or football or jumping. Funny historical facts made everyone laugh. Brilliant tour and museum of a very unique and historic stadium in Dublin.

The museum is small but really informative about the roots of the GAA and its role in Ireland's history.

Likewise, the tour offers a great way of exploring the inner working of the ground and gives you a unique view of the stadium.

Great even if you don't understand any of the GAA's sports. We had a fantastic time doing the Croke Park Tour and were so lucky to have Jess showing us around! :) She was absolutely brilliant and shared so much interesting information and history about the grounds. Loved the museum as well. It's such a nice tour to do and so reasonably priced! :) What a fantastic tour and museum. Our tour guide, Cian, was fun, personable, knowledgeable and made the whole experience that much better. Great behind the scenes look at Croke Park and a great learning experience from someone who hasn't really watched GAA. The museum was also a nice cherry on top. Spent last two hours in the company of one of the greatest sports player Ireland has, thank you Cora Staunton for your generosity and time. #bordgaisenergylegendstours
what a legacy to have."
32,GPO Museum,5.0,"Great way to learn more about Ireland's modern history. The audio guide is really terrific and the short movie is exceptionally well put together. The tour and museum explore all areas of life around the period of the Easter rising in 1916 to show the build-up and societal conditions that lead to revolution. It also covers the subsequent war for independence and the longer lasting effects. Great museum which we were fortunate enough to visit on the anniversary of the Easter Rising. A well thought out introduction to the history with exhibits, an immersive dramatised video, written information and commentary from a wide range of historians & experts. Well worth the entry fee. Step back in time at the GPO Museum, located within the historic General Post Office on O'Connell Street in Dublin. This engaging museum offers a profound insight into Ireland's tumultuous history, particularly the 1916 Easter Rising. Interactive exhibits and immersive narratives provide a visceral experience, capturing the pivotal moments that shaped the nation. Ideal for history enthusiasts and anyone looking to understand Ireland's path to independence, the GPO Museum is a cornerstone of cultural heritage in Dublin. The GPO Museum in Dublin provides a comprehensive and immersive exploration of Ireland's revolutionary history, focusing particularly on the events surrounding the Easter Rising of 1916. Housed within the historic General Post Office building, which served as the nerve center of the Rising, the museum offers visitors a unique opportunity to step back in time and experience the sights, sounds, and stories of this pivotal moment in Irish history.

One of the museum's standout features is the Witness History exhibition, which uses a combination of artifacts, multimedia displays, and interactive technology to bring the events of the Easter Rising to life. Visitors can follow the journey of the rebels as they plan and execute the Rising, experiencing the chaos and confusion of battle through immersive audiovisual presentations.

The museum also delves into the broader context of Irish history, exploring the social, political, and economic factors that contributed to the rise of Irish nationalism and the desire for independence. From the Great Famine to the Land War, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped Ireland's struggle for self-determination.

In addition to its focus on the Easter Rising, the GPO Museum highlights the contributions of key figures in Irish history, including James Connolly, Padraig Pearse, and Countess Markievicz. Personal stories, letters, and artifacts provide insights into the lives and motivations of these individuals, offering a more intimate perspective on the events of the time.

Through its engaging exhibits and educational programs, the GPO Museum seeks to promote understanding, dialogue, and reflection on Ireland's revolutionary past and its relevance to contemporary society. It serves as a reminder of the enduring spirit of resilience, courage, and determination that defined the Irish people in their quest for freedom and independence. In this historical building you can meet the history of Ireland of the last 100 years. It s easy to visit as in the city centre. You should take audio guide as it will help you expand you knowledge and understand many historical facts in details. You may need about 1 hour to visit it. Worth combine it with another museum in the city centre for a lovely morning city excursion! Great tour and it's must if you want to learn some great Irish History Nice old building. Staff are friendly and helpful. I enjoyed buying some gifts from here that shows the lovely Irish culture Very beautiful museum to absolutely do in Dublin. I loved !"
33,Garda Siochana Memorial Garden,4.0,"A lovely garden located in the grounds of the castle, also the entrance to the Chester Beaty museum, which is definitely worth a visit. Very humbling to visit this garden and pay respects. I spent a few quiet moments just taking in the ambience. Definitely woyh a visit if you are in this area. Lovely addition to the park,
Hidden from views by Old walls An Garda Siochana Memorial Garden honours the members of An Garda Siochana who were killed in the service of the State. The names of the members of An Garda Siochana who were killed are inscribed in stone within the garden. Additionally, a specially commissioned glass sculpture commemorates the sacrifice of the families left behind and a specially commissioned stone sculpture is a tribute to all deceased members of An Garda Siochana, the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Garda Siochana Memorial Garden

The reproduction of a Zen garden with Irish style.
Three modern sculptures in a corner of the small castle park.
We go there, we see and we leave.
Not very interesting and visit the park in 10 minutes.

Good walk This place is a very beautifully maintained dedication to men and women or Garda. Respect for all the Gardai who have dedicated their life's to keeping order and peace amongst their citizens and go above the call of duty to doing what is right for the people of Dublin. Lots of respect to those who deserve it.  Nice place Awesome park for sun bathing."
34,Garden of Remembrance,4.875,"Really beautiful place. It's a nice place to spend some time. It's very well kept with nice flowers and plenty of seating. Absolutely beautiful place to chill out and relax listening to the birds singing Wonderful peaceful place to remember those who fought for our freedom Beautifull place and we'll maintained.  They have lots of benches to sit and relax. Definitely worth a visit Opened by De Valera in 1966 to commemorate all those who lost their lives in the pursuit of Irish freedom.  It's well maintained and a little tranquil oasis in the middle of Dublin city.  There's a few steps down to it but there's also a lift.  There's lots of seating and a good spot to hide away from the blustery weather.   Not sure about car parking nearby and there's no toilets but the writer's museum is beside it and a few other spots.  One of the hop on/off buses stops beside it. Beautiful place, it would be perfect to visit on a sunny day! If you come to Dublin you need to take a walk to the garden of remembrance it's a beautiful park with lists of Irish history put it on your to do list in Ireland  A very calm link, full of emotion and history, where it is pleasant to go"
35,Giants Causeway Tour,4.875,"Went with Finn McCool tour as we had good experience from the last time we took the tour of Glendenlough. This time it was the Giants Causeway and Belfast, the tour guide was great and gave some great insights into the cultural and political background of the region along with some great music too. Time at Causeway was enough but limited at Belfast. It was great experience overall. Would recommend. Absolutely stunning and must do trip when you're in Northern Ireland... the rock formations here is a wonder and the views are amazing. Make sure to pack your jacket as it can get really windy and chilly Great walks, stunning views avoid visitor centre just a trap free toilets up at hotel and free to go to giants causeway. This was such an amazing tour!! I like it more than cliffs of moher just bc of how much there was to do. Also the drivers are absolutely AMAZING we heard Irish mythology stories, pub songs, and learned a lot of history about Ireland. Money very well spent Extraordinary experience that truly bridged the natural beauty of Norther Ireland with the fictional world of Game Of Thrones.  Flip our personal tour guide was such a pleasure to spend the day with. His passion for GOT and for sharing his knowledge from an insider perspective as well as a geological perspective were so appreciated.

We filled our day with challenging walks and funny banter from our first meeting to our final goodbye,  Flip made traveling to Ireland after a two and half year wait just exceed my expectations of what this trip could be during winter.  While it was very cold and windy touring the natural sights, Flips ability to transport you back into the GOT movies and envision being there was a bit mind blowing.  I was indeed so happy to have Flips's one on one attention and careful guidance as compared to the big bus tours that would sometimes arrive with no sight guidance.

Flips insider GOT's movie experience and stories made you feel like you had joined and insider community and you had front row tickets.  Booking a personalized private tour with Flip will make you feel like you won the lottery as well as gained a new friend in Belfast. I can honestly say that with all the personalized tours that I have experienced around the world that Flip delivers the most personal, in-depth and curated experience which can only be a 5 STAR rating. Loved the hiking & nature! Very relaxing! Absolutely fabulous tour, the nature and amazing views! I took a day tour and it was perfect. Professional with some interesting stories about the place. Amazing tour the 12 hours went by so quick. Gerard was a fantastic tour guide made everything lively and fun diving into the rich Ireland history, Fred the driver was courteous and always made the drive feel safe. Highly recommend for any traveler looking to book exciting tour of Ireland"
36,Go City(r) - Dublin,3.625,"I had a great experience using the 7 attraction choice pass in Dublin! Used it for the hop on hop off bus, night bus tour, Guinness storehouse, Jameson whiskey tour, Irish rock n roll museum, epic emigration museum, and st Patrick's cathedral! Great value. We only have 2 days in Dublin, so we selected the main  3 attractions we want to visit.
The adult 3 attractions Explorer pass seemed perfect for our needs.
I bought 2 x passes only to find out once I had downloaded the passes that each pass has a value of EUR115.
Our planned 3 attractions come to EUR124.
I tried phoning the Go City UK number. Couldn't get through, so I gave up and then spent over 30 minutes on the Go City Chat, which, by the way, leaves a lot to be desired.
To sum up, the pass can not be used for our three attractions, so we will have to rethink our plans.
I won't be using any GoCity passes again. It was not clear that when buying the 3 day pass, you could only use the hop on/hop off bus for one calendar day.   It seemed nice at first to have so many attractions in one place until you realize that most require external reservations ahead of time so you end up digging through emails to find both the reservation/ticket AND having to provide the pass QR code.   This would have been cheaper/easier to book separately.   Especially considering you don't have access to the bus to get to most attractions after day 1. If you want to visit Dublin, don't hesitate to take this pass.
We took it 3 days and didn't even get to do all the attractions offered.
Well worth paying EUR230 for 3 and we made a saving of EUR250 on our visits. You save loads of money if you plan to visit the distelleries, museums and cathedrals. The Dublin Pass comes in handy. Don't buy it if you doing a handful of attractions. The one day all inclusive pass worked great.  Hop-on Hop-off bus with access to lots of the major things to see and do in Dublin. We found this hardly usable and ended up spending extra money for things that should have been included as systems weren't working to take reservations.  I requested a partial refund to cover extra expenses incurred and it was rejected.
The tour operator, despite numerous attempts to contact them,  did not return any messages.
It ruined my day. We used it as a taxi service. It worked perfect for us especially after going to distillery's and brewery."
37,Golden Ticket Tours,5.0,"This tour is an amazing experience whether you're a tourist or a Dublin native looking for a fun day out. Clodagh is extremely knowledgeable and took us to some great spots that I've never tried before, every bit of food I tasted that day was absolutely delicious. Each stop on the tour has something completely different. There's something there for everyone. Would highly recommend this tour. The tour was so enjoyable. Clodagh was a great tour guide and you could tell she's a food expert. It was so well thought out generally. The food and craic along the way was fantastic, and it was great learning about traditional and emerging Dublin and Irish cuisine. The Pastel De Nata pastries were the bomb in particular, and a nice pint or two of Guinness at the end was a great way to finish up. It was also a great way to see Dublin and learn more of its fascinating history and character. You really get a good feel for the city and its people by the end of the tour. Unforgettable Dublin Food Tour with Chef Clodagh!

I did the food tour with Chef Clodagh with my brother and it was an absolute highlight of our trip to Dublin! From start to finish, the experience was exceptional. Clodagh's passion for food and her extensive knowledge of Dublin's culinary scene made this tour both educational and delicious.

We visited a variety of hidden gems and well-loved spots, sampling everything from traditional Irish fare to modern twists on classic dishes. Each stop was thoughtfully chosen, and Clodagh's insider tips and personal anecdotes added a unique and personal touch to the tour.

What truly set this tour apart was Clodagh's engaging personality and genuine love for what she does. She made sure everyone felt included and catered to all dietary preferences with ease. By the end of the tour, we not only had full stomachs but also a deeper appreciation for Dublin's rich culinary heritage.

If you're looking for an authentic and enjoyable food adventure in Dublin, look no further than this tour with Golden Ticket Tours. Highly recommended! This is an amazing experience. Clodagh's knowledge on food and Dublin itself was so impressive and enjoyable. A wonderful variety of the go to, delicious spots in the city. Delish tour, Would recommend again and again. This is the tour to do if you want an authentic experience of the city with a born and bred Dubliner. Not only is Clodagh, the tour host, incredibly knowledgeable about food, her passion also shines through! Awesome experience. Fabulous food and a very enjoyable way to spend the afternoon.  Saw parts of Dublin I didn't know existed. Good fun too and Clodagh knows her stuff. Highly recommended. Walking tours are something we always like to do, and this tour of Dublin is up there with the best.  It was everything it promised - amazing food, interesting anecdotes from a very knowledgeable guide, and the best pint! A fabulous new addition to the walking tours of Dublin. Clodagh was an unreal tour guide, very informative and just great craic in general! Would highly recommend!"
38,Grafton Street,4.5,"i like this street and the stores there but these ppl singing are annoying af, at least that night it was. everyone tryna be the next ed sheeran, jus cuz u ginger and short don't make u ed sheeran. Beautiful street that is rich of shops and even nice architecture, design and old buildings Busy with lots of shops and food! Great for people watching. I enjoyed see people, a mix of locals and tourists. The buildings are nice. It is a nice walk, even if you do care about the stores, as it was for me. One of Ed Sheeran's song come aliveeee Nice shopping street where everyone can find something to itself Scenic pedestrianised street Great street with nice shops. A lot of street performers also. It can get busy so I would recommend going in the morning"
39,Grattan Bridge,4.375,"Probably one of the best locations to take beautiful pictures of Dublin. I was too lazy to, but that doesn't mean you should be. The walkways are spacious and connect the two most popular regions of Dublin together. When the water is flat and the sky has beautiful clouds, it's perfect for a photo. I love landscapes and every day is a different one, in the same place. I used it to make music with lots of people listening to it Good views up and down the Liffey with south facing seats for warm sunny days Only place where we were able to see the New Year's fireworks....but it is very short and not extraordinary A relatively wide bridge where you can actually sit on.

It offers some scenic views of Dublin's buildings along the river. The water wasn't really pleasant to look at, and the smells were not that great. Birds are bothering is and pooping every where. There were seats but most were not clean. However, it had fantastic street at in view, so it was worth the walk. One of many bridges that cross the River Liffey."
40,Griffith Park,4.875,"We visited Griffith Park for a child's birthday party. It is a fabulous location for this as it has a lovely large playground near a seating area. The Tram cafe is centred about 100 meters from the playground. There is good parking nearby. The kids had a blast and the adults had a wonderful time chatting while keeping an eye on sprogs. One of the most beautiful parks I've ever been to around the world  lots of playground areas for kids, an outdoor workout set, as well as lots of beautiful areas of grass, trees and river. Beautiful and big park. Includes a complete playground with sandbox. It is a really good place to go with your family! Have a lot of space to kids and dogs. Lovely Wonderful park, full of kids and families. The children's playground was done up nice and we love spending a day enjoying the sand pit or the swings with the little one. New coffee shop with the restroom available on the spot was a much needed addition. Beautiful park. Ideal for a walk, relaxation, sports equipment available , children's playground, very big enough for joggers and even watching a gentle stream flowing in the middle.  Very good. Fantastic park, was a long time since I'd been there so was a pleasant surprise to see it had been transformed.
If your local.or even a short trip away i highly recommend visiting A beautiful park with the Tolka River running through it.  The park is full of lovely, mature trees throughout.  Perfect for days out and long walks.  The Tram Cafe is located beside the playgrounds.  Their coffee is fantastic and is well worth checking out."
41,Guinness Storehouse,4.75,"Today marked my third visit to this prestigious venue, eager to immerse myself once again in the world of Guinness beer. What continues to captivate me is the mesmerizing cascade of bubbles that dance down the glass as the beer settles. It's a sight that never fails to intrigue and delight. Despite not being a beer enthusiast originally, Guinness has completely won me over with its rich flavors and smooth texture. It's no wonder why Irish people hold it in such high regard. Each visit deepens my appreciation for this iconic brew and the craft behind it. The Guinness Storehouse in Dublin is a must-visit. This historic seven-story building offers an immersive experience into the world of Guinness, covering its history, brewing process, and iconic advertising. Highlights include the hands-on Guinness Academy, where you learn to pour the perfect pint, and the Gravity Bar, offering stunning panoramic views of Dublin alongside a complimentary pint of Guinness. The exhibits are well-presented and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. Overall, it's a captivating blend of culture, history, and interactive fun, making it a top attraction in Dublin. Highly recommended! Great experience and I've done plenty of brewery tours (Budweiser, Coors, etc) and ever worked at Coors brewery.. this was by far the best family friendly experience tour I've been on for major brands.  My non-beer drinking wife and mom loved it, and my 1yr old baby loved it based on her reactions throughout the self paced tour.  Stroller friendly, and you get to skip the entry line too with a stroller.  Experience is great, ends with a pint or soft drink, and the gift shop has everything you need to remember your time.  Golf peeps they have something for us in the shop. This was a great experience there is a lot to see and learn here. I did the guided tasting and it was worth every penny, we got to sample different types of Guinness and learn how to pour the perfect pint at the end of the tour. The gift shop was full of really interesting and unique items that made wonderful gifts. I would strongly recommend that you book your tour in advance spots in the guided tour go fast. At the end of the tour you get a voucher for a free pint of Guinness on the roof of the building, there are some people who don't drink Guinness so they may offer you the voucher for the free drink. The views from the top of the storehouse are amazing you can see a lot from there on a clear day. Interesting place to visit, obviously centred around Guinness fans. We did feel that the exhibits were somewhat padded out to try to fill the space. A whole area dedicated to the water used etc etc. Good views from the bar at the top, the advertising floor was quite interesting. In my opinion, unless you are a real fan of Guinness it is interesting but not a must visit. The most iconic tourist attraction in Dublin, I really did enjoy my visit, it was a self guided tour with some amazing views, dance and music show and history and we got to try a glass of the drink. It's a must visit. We had an amazing time. They were also horse carriage rides just right outside if you wanted to. Buy tickets for the self guided tour as they sell out fast. Easy to enter. Your was great. Lots of cool visuals and videos. Grab a pint on the top floor with a 360 view of Dublin. The Guinness storehouse is a must bucket list place to visit!
We were totally blown away with all the details, information and visual artifacts on the tour!

I was wondering what it was going to be in here? But was pleasantly surprised!

So much to view and information to take in, it was kind of overwhelming and fascinating!
I loved the visual waterfall that they produced shapes of Guinness
Glasses, The Irish Harp symbol, and their pure water in display, dropping from the ceiling.
It was so quick and clear, but hard to get a good picture of it all.

Also loved the wheat growing in the field section, the colour changes in use wheat and ceiling beautiful!

I was also fascinated with the information of how the Coopers made all the barrels, to hold all the Guinness made.
As a Carpenter myself, had great respect for how hard this job would of been! All done by hand, shaping all this Oak, at great speeds, with only the eye of the tradesman, perfecting the pieces to make the barrels

Information to how they made the Guinness finished product in visuals, was brilliant, learnt so much today.

Then onto the taste testing room, where they done a presentation and we all had a tiny glass of Guinness

Finally, up to the Gravity bar where we had a free pint of the black stuff, a beautiful pint of Guinness each

We managed to share a take and seats with a lovely group of Americans.

We enjoyed our Guinness and the view of the Dublin City landscape, truly fantastic!
Thank you to all at the Guinness factory."
42,Ha'penny Bridge,4.375,"A historic icon that you should definitely stop to see while you're in Dublin!
Walk across the bridge to access the Temple Bar area with all of its famous pubs!
The bridge is lit up at night, so check it out after sunset, too. Cute little bridge to walk across from city center, lots of restaurants on both sides of bridge. Very touristy as one would expect It isn't the prettiest of bridges or backdrops, but this bridge is part of the core of Dublin. When you know, you know! #Dirty Owl Town Pedestrian bridge across the river, historical significance but nothing extraordinary as a tourist now. Near Temple Bar area so can pop out to see it. A lovely bridge and a great picture I managed to take this evening!

The Ha'penny Bridge (/'heIpni/ HAYP-nee; Irish: Droichead na Leathphingine, or Droichead na Life), known later for a time as the Penny Ha'penny Bridge, and officially the Liffey Bridge, is a pedestrian bridge built in May 1816 over the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland. Made of cast iron, the bridge was cast in Shropshire, England. a beautiful historic bridge in the centre of dublin. also had some great views of both sides of the city! The Ha'penny Bridge is truly iconic - a symbol of Dublin's charm and history. Crossing this picturesque bridge is like stepping into a postcard scene. Its elegant design and breathtaking views of the River Liffey make it a must-see landmark. A timeless gem that encapsulates the spirit of Dublin, offering a magical experience for locals and visitors alike. This bridge cuts across the centre of the city and is a great photo spot to showcase the city. It's free to cross and is surrounded by many other bridges."
43,Henry Grattan Monument,4.375,"Freestanding bronze statue of Henry Grattan, executed by John Henry Foley, erected 1876. Surmounting square-profile dressed limestone pedestal with incised name plaques to recessed panels on stepped dressed limestone base with scrolled brackets. Two former gas lamp standards with carved sea horses to east. Located on traffic island to centre of College Green facing Trinity College. A deceptively attractive man of his time, a bygone age, who was extremely biased and idealistic but had his heart in the right place. His statue has always been contentious but less than the successfully toppled Parnell. Leaving the rest of this review in his own words, ""I will remain anchored here with fidelity to the fortunes of my country, faithful to her freedom, faithful to her fall."" You find the statue of Henry Grattan on an prime location inbetween  the Bank of Ireland and the main entrance of Trinity College. A lot of traffic there. The statue stands like on a small island. In front of trinity college. It's a meeting point for many tours. Can get quite busy. Nice to learn about the history of Ireland. It's located next to the old college. Great view of Trinity College, and close to big shopping districts Great Very beautiful statue."
44,Hidden Dublin Walks,4.25,"Fantastic tour of little known secrets of Dublin's history. Hear haunting tales and visit places of the past. Very informative, a must tour when you visit Dublin. I did the Dublin North Quay guided ghost walk. Well worth it for the money. It lasted around two hours and ended at brazen head. Got to hear some very interesting history about Ireland at our different stops. I went on the Dublin's Haunted History Walking Tour and our tour guide was Kate. She was fantastic! She made the tour memorable and my only regret is doing this tour on my last night in Dublin because she mentioned so many things to check out that I was unaware of during my time in Dublin. She made me want to come back to Dublin to check out more things - and I would redo this exact tour next time. Fun tour up to the Hellfire Club and a lot of history.  Definitely worth the visit, probably of any of their other offerings as well. A fun and interesting way to see a few spots around Dublin. Covers a very specific bit of the story so make sure to read or watch a documentary about the events if you aren't familiar with it. The script is well written and thought out. The bus did do a bit of time killing loops and was looking a bit worse for wear on the inside. One whole side of lights was burned out and the sculpted foam interior needed a few minutes with a brush and some grey paint. All together a fun two hours but study up to get the most out of it. Scammed out of 75 euro for a Drag Bus tour that never took place. They didn't even offer another tour in exchange and instead just asked me for proof of purchase and then blamed a past employee saying they lost money on it. Still have not refunded and continue to ignore emails. Incredibly unprofessional. It's a must if you want to know more about the history of Ireland. A lot of information in a very unique way. On the other hand it is better if you read before the tour some of the Ireland independence history to fully understand everything. Actors were amazing  Just went on Saturday. Excellent. Great craic and fun. You're sure to learn something new, even if you think you're an expert. The tour stops consist of the GPO, Dublin Castle, and Richmond Barracks with witness testimonies from the time being acted out wonderfully. Be nice and leave a tip at the end."
45,Hugh Lane Gallery,4.75,"Free entry, and I went especially to see the eve of st Agnes stained glass window by Irish artist Harry Clarke. Magnificent. It's in a special room with a few other beautiful pieces by other artists. The gallery also has other beautiful works and is worth the visit. Cloakrooms cafe and gift shop also. Situated by the stunning memorial gardens which are also worth seeing. Free gallery worth a few permanent exhibits and done rotating. Definitely worth a visit!

Lovely cafe downstairs, as well - amazing soup! Lots of pastries and nice pot of tea. Outdoor seating in nice weather. Great hidden gem of a gallery that's not too busy but a great variety of pieces. Thank you to the lovely lady who provided the free tour on Sunday (recommended) and gave a great overview of some of the key pieces in the gallery. Went to visit the Andy Warhol art exhibition in the Hugh Lane Gallery, and I must say it was quite an interesting exhibition. Originally the inside of the building used to be white, but now it's painted black and your able to visit the gallery for free, unless there is a famous artist on display, then you must pay an entry fee. Free galleries are always worth a visit, but if you can, get a tour. My group was guided by Iseult who took us to a choice of highlights in the gallery. I particularly enjoyed her detailed introduction on the architecture of the gallery (Charlemont House) and the history of the gallery itself. The Francis Bacon studio is an amazing exhibit, and the collection of impressionist paintings was impressive. Another highlight was the stained glass room with Harry Clarke's work. Really enjoyed this visit. Wonderful gallery, friendly staff and amazing art work Francis Bacon's Studio is a must see Fab gallery with Francis Bacon Studio. We arrived an hour before closing and there were few people around so we could indulge in the exhibition. Bag storage, toilets and cafe to enjoy. Lovely shop. We came back the next day to spend longer perusing the other galleries. Recommended on a trip to Dublin. Went to the Andy Worhol exhibition in Hugh Lane Gallery. The exhibition is only available till 28th January. It was amazing to see his work in person as I am a huge fan of Marilyn Monroe."
46,Irish Family History Centre,4.5,"A story that had to told...

Thank you for telling the story! An informative and wonderfully interactive exhibition of Irish history. The building has been creatively repurposed and is fitting for this museum.

It's called ""Epic"" for all the right reasons. Amazing source of the history of Ireland. There is also a Geneology Dept...you need an appt...but they are available (@a fee) to help find more information on your family. (They do one at a time). During my appointment I realized how important it is to utilize a professional to research your family history.  Public documents are often hard to uncover because of changed names, missing data, and other issues.  In an hour, My specialist was able to trace back four generations and find the specific property lots where my relatives might still reside.  Road trip ahead!  Thanks What an amazing and insightful session with Patrick at the Irish Family History Centre! The family information and history he was able to access blew us away -- he really is the ultimate investigator in genealogy. Patrick does not give up and was just as excited by the discoveries as we were. Highly recommend a visit to the centre if you have any interest in learning more about your Irish roots. I brought my mother up to the Irish Family History Centre as a Birthday activity. She has always been interested in her family history and I thought this would be a nice afternoon for us to spend together. We spent an afternoon in the Irish Family History Centre working with Genealogist, Patrick Roycroft. It was a fantastic experience and we found out so much about our family history that we never expected to uncover. It was a pleasure to work with Patrick who was full of knowledge and genuinely as excited as we were to connect the dots and retrace so many layers of our family from over the years. We found the consultation so useful that we doubled our time. Patrick was very efficient, wasted no time and gave us the information we needed to continue exploring our family's past after our visit. We have every intention of going up again to explore other parts of our family tree as on our last visit we gained information that we never would have expected to come across or even known to look for. We wouldn't have been as successful on our own and it most certainly helped to speed up the process! We would highly recommend a visit to this fantastic resource centre. Looking forward to our next visit. I did an online consult through zoom with Maura who did a nice job showing websites to use. Maura was very good. What was not good, was that part of the consult was supposed to include a month's use of the findmypast web site. I was told i would get a code via email in 2-3 weeks. Nothing yet and I have followed up as Maura had suggested with the folks that scheduled the session and have not received any response at all in a month and a half. I really recommend a visit to this centre.  The staff are particularly helpful and knowledgeable on Irish  family history/searching matters. I would suggest however, that you undertake a little research yourself,  before you leave home. This will assist  your researcher by really focusing on your ancestors/family,  eliminating the need to troll through unnecessary records, and therefore giving you flexibility with your budget. Fees are reasonable, but come in half hour blocks.  I found that I needed more time than that.  I have some  experience in searching archives. Amazing researchers .You must book in advance."
47,Irish Museum of Modern Art,4.375,"The museum which is located inside an old but beautiful hospital building was quite underwhelming. The exhibitions were small and mediocre at most. Eventhough the entry was free I can not really recommend to go here. However, the people who work there are nice and can give you some background information when asked. The grounds and gardens  are very pleasant  to visit and walk around. Museum wasn't open day we went there but will definitely go back another time. The building looks impressive from outside and the coffee was good from the food truck located  in the courtyard  The grounds, garden and museum itself are nice to wander around in summer or in winter Lovely museum and entrance is free! There is also a cafe on site and a lovely garden
The museum is in two buildings, so make sure to see both! I had an amazing time at the Irish Museum of Morern Art. It's a fantastic place for both children and adults to learn about modern art. The habitats are well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. This beautiful art gallery is a must-visit!

It offers frequently changing exhibits, spacious grounds perfect for exploring, and a welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere.
I'm always impressed by the variety of the exhibitions - there's something for everyone.
I appreciate how often they change, keeping things fresh.

The gardens provide a lovely space for strolling or a picnic on a sunny day.

The inclusion of both a cafe and a coffee truck offers convenient options for refreshments.

The fact that the museum itself is free makes it accessible to all, and while the parking does have a cost, it's great to have that option on-site The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) is a must-visit for anyone interested in contemporary art.
The museum is housed in a beautiful historic building, which adds to the overall experience of exploring the diverse collection of modern artworks. If you enjoy Modern Art, you will enjoy this.
I most enjoyed the grounds and learning the history of the building.
Some of the art goes beyond my comprehension and is therefore less enjoyable. But as it changes, you never know what you might see.
The museum is free entry, with a donation if you are interested. The information centre about the building is also free."
48,Irish Music Wall of Fame,4.25,"We didn't actually visit the Irish Rock n' Roll Museum but if you're with a group heading towards Temple Bar, it's worth a photo stop. It's a good talking point for tourists who may (or may not!) know some of the great figures in Irish music. Very nice pub with good live music and unique decoration. A little bit expensive when compared with other pubs in the area. They offer concerts every month during the whole year. It is worth the visit. I enjoyed viewing the wall. Our tour guide was very thorough. A grand red wall near 'the temple bar' dedicated to the heavyweights of Irish music such as U2, Phil Lynott, Rory Gallagher, Sinead O'Connor and many other names. Magnificent wall. Possibility to visit the interior also. I've seen this building outside before. I haven't been there yet but I'd really love to visit it someday in the future. I'm sure this place sounds very interesting. Great! The waiters removed our full glasses of whiskey twice when we where not looking. It seems they are trained for that... Terrible experience."
49,Irish Whiskey Museum,4.875,"Can't recommend this place enough! We did the classic tour (3 tastings). Was so much more than just a whiskey lesson - we learned so much about Ireland throughout history! Our tour guide Keith was so knowledgeable, entertaining, and easy to follow. Will definitely make a return visit on a future trip. What an experience to learn about the history of where the term whiskey comes from and means.

Your staff and tour were absolutely incredible and welcoming to a first time Canadian from Vancouver visiting your beautiful city of Dublin, Ireland.

The choices I had on the premium tour were very tasty and well described to enjoy.
I decided to buy the Irishman Legecy bottle at the airport to bring home after trying the standard Irishman version. I cannot wait to try this again.

Thank you again everyone and a must stop for anyone in Dublin looking for an adventure. I went alone and had a GREAT time. Definitely worth a visit! I didn't know much about whiskey about the fact that I like it and I heard some nice reviews about this museum, and it definitely met my expectations! The story of whiskey and the different families that were producing it in Dublin is really interesting. The guide I had on my tour was amazing, not only he explained everything so perfectly but he also was extremely fun and entertaining! The final tasting is really good and it lets you understand different whiskey flavours and types better. It's definitely a nice museum to visit upon your arrival in Ireland. It doesn't really have any artifacts, but the tour guides are awesome. They keep this museum alive with their strong storytelling skills. I would say that the price is reasonable if you consider tasting 3 small-medium whiskey portions and  that Fercullen (top left bottle) is quite expensive. Definitely visit it if you have time. Was a great tour with the overall history of Irish whiskey, the whiskey tax, prohibition and the comeback. Tour starts with a history video then takes you through several historical periods before tasting. I paid for the premium tour that came with four whiskey samples and a souvenir whiskey glass. Whiskey for sampling is dependent on their sponsors at the time. Our guide was personable and it was a great time. I suggest the Writer's Tears if it is available. My father and I had our very first trip to Ireland, and the Irish Whiskey Museum was something we wanted to do while in Dublin.
We scheduled the Irish Whiskey Museum blending tour for the day we arrived and were not disappointed.  It was a fun experience, and our tour host/guide Darragh was great at his job. He definitely deserves to be acknowledged for his exuberance and wit. He was very fun to talk with and gave a great tour, history, and overview of the whiskeys you taste and blend.
What a great way to start our memorable first trip to Ireland.
I definitely recommend this if you have time and enjoy Irish Whiskey.
I don't know why I took a picture of the crapper at the Irish Whiskey Museum, but I thought I would add it anyway. We enjoyed the Whiskey Museum tour and tasting experience. Braian was both knowledgeable and entertaining. He personalized the tour for individuals from different parts of the world and their level of knowledge. Visited the museum over the May bank holiday. Great experience and Stuart the guide a wonderfully entertaining performance. He was very good at explaining the origins of Whiskey. Then you get to blend some whiskey. That was nice. Learned some interesting facts about how whiskey got it's name and the difference colours and tastes."
50,James Connolly Memorial,4.625,"Beautiful bronze statue of iconic Irish Revolution Marxist Socialist. May he rest in power and workers of the world unite for a united Ireland and a liberated Palestine. This statue is a memory to James Connolly, the early 20th century Irish nationalist politician and socialist leader. Sadly he was executed for his role in the the Easter Uprising despite the fact that we was so badly injured that he would've died of his injuries anyway.

The statue is situated by Butt Bridge, near Gardiner Street Lower. The bronze, life-sized statue shows James Connolly standing contemplatively looking into the distance. Behind the statue, a curved wall holds communist motifs of a bronze plough and stars. If you are interest in history this is without doubt a 5 star attraction.

As James Connolly, the greatest Marxist and socialist thinker, organiser and leader Ireland ever produced, was a great internationalist and anti-imperialist writer and campaigner this memorial attracts many visitors all year round.

Unfortunately because of its location and traffic flow issues this can be a awkward location to get to ... make sure to use the pedestrian lights if you are crossing the street. Great memorial to a Great Irish patriot. Ireland's most famous socialist, James Connolly (1868-1916), is depicted proudly in front of the plough and stars of his Irish Citizen Army. An influential organiser for workers' rights, his role in the Easter Rising cemented his legacy, with his particularly cruel execution helping to fan the flames of Irish independence.
Born in Edinburgh, June 5th, 1868, Connolly first went to Ireland as a fourteen year old member of the British Army. He married in Scotland where he became involved in Socialism. In 1896 he moved to Dublin where he founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party and also started a newspaper the Workers' Republic. He spent seven years in America where he lectured and organized. He was an organizer for the Wobblies in the New York area.

Connolly returned to Ireland in 1910 and campaigned for the Socialist Party. Jim Larkin appointed him as Ulster Organiser for the ITGWU in Belfast but in 1913 he came back to Dublin to help during the Lockout. Connolly was one of the founders of the Irish Citizen Army. Throughout his life he wrote and published extensively on Irish and socialist issues. Tom Clarke was always sure to include Connolly and the ICA in any IRB or Volunteer celebrations, e.g. Rossa's funeral in 1915 or the Wolfe Tone commemoration.

During the Easter Rising he was appointed Commandant-General of the Dublin brigade, directing the Army of the Irish Republic in the GPO. Badly wounded in two separate incidents Connolly was executed strapped to a chair on 12th May 1916. Having fun right there  It's ok good statue a little bit of history of Dublin if your passing have a look (informative) Lovely commemoration but could do with a power wash."
51,James Joyce Centre,4.75,"A quirky little museum! It was quite small but fans of James Joyce (especially Ulysses) will enjoy it. It was a little hectic when I visited because they were preparing for Bloomsday but overall the staff were kind and friendly. They had a few interesting books and journals about James Joyce in the store too! (As well as some free books in the entrance hallway.) Really cool and well-put together exhibition following James Joyce's life and his experience with Ulysses. They focus on the women that made him who he is as well as his craft and his living situations throughout his life...excellent. I had a great time here! Adult - 7EUR
Student - 5 EUR
A museum well organized with a great guide!
Representing the Ulysses story very well, with virtual original objects! Very friendly and welcoming. Can't wait to come back. A must-visit for anyone interested in James Joyce, 'Ulysses', or Dublin. Absolutely wonderful place and seriously giving instructive as insightful a glimpse of this literary giant  Located in the house where James Joyce wrote Ulysses, this place is steeped in the author's memory. The rich decoration as well as the numerous conferences perpetuate the memory of the man who was one of the greatest innovators of 20th century literature. An essential stopping-off point for Joyce enthusiasts, and those who just want to find out more. The Centre organises walking tours and Joyce-related events. Don't miss the original front door of no 7 Eccles St, the most famous address in literature. (And I am including The Stable, Bethlehem, here, AND 121b Baker St, London.) I bought a ticket for Leopold Bloom's footsteps Walktour (The walk tours are only on Fridays and includes the entrance to the centre). The tour through the city was very fun and the guide, Leslie, was amazing, on every step he read and sometimes acted some lines from Ulysses. Take in consideration that the tour lasts more than 2 hours, and finishes on the national library of Ireland."
52,Jameson Distillery Bow St.,5.0,"This is a must-visit place to learn all about whisky and its fascinating production process. It's incredibly easy to understand the intricacies and smell the distinct differences during the tour. We enjoyed some excellent Irish whisky shots and special cocktails too. The Jameson whisky tour was informative yet relaxed. It's definitely a great spot to explore and indulge in the world of whisky. Such a fantastic experience at the distillery last week. We had the absolute pleasure of being guided by Alexandra - 1000% made to be a tour guide!! Such passion, such history, and the tasting elements were so interesting. We opted for the additional cask draw along with the tour and this was SUCH a good addition. Highly recommend! A really great Irish whiskey tour in Dublin!
We enjoyed the ""basic"" one hour program with an introduction to the drink distillation of Irish whiskey, the history of Jameson, and the taste testing of 3 different whiskeys.
We were greeted with a welcome drink, and then our guide led us through the rest!
Our experience was very good, and we learned a lot about the local whiskeys and how they are different.
At the end, we walked through the gift shop and perused all of the different items available as well as the different whiskeys for sale.
I would definitely recommend this experience for anyone that is a whiskey fan, or even not a whiskey fan, and we will recommend it to others! Great tour! We mixed our own 50ml bottle (size of a nip). We were provided with a really nice leather apron (which I wish I could have taken home ) to wear while mixing our blend. Our guide was very knowledgeable, relatable and passionate about whiskey. There were only 4 people in our mixing class which was the perfect size. Everyone seemed happy with their blend since you are making it to your satisfaction. I didn't taste mine because I don't drink but I went for the experience. So people that don't drink can still enjoy this experience. I was able to mix my blend based on the aroma of the different whiskeys. You also take home a small notebook and pencil that you use during the class to write down the blends you want to mix. We did the general tasting tour. The place is amazing with an interesting history. We got to learn about how Jameson is made and got to try three different kinds of whiskey. The crested was the best of the three. The black barrel was also excellent.

Great historical tour. We need to come back and take the classes. Make sure to check out the cat in the rafters. This experience surprised me in a positive way and surpassed my expectations. I am not a Jameson drinker but I really enjoyed the way they do the tour. Plenty of tasting and they make you feel welcomed. Our guide was great. He was informative , knowledgeable, lighthearted, and entertaining. Would recommend 10/10 Great tour and explanation of how one of the world's most famous whiskeys is made and the history behind it.

You don't get to tour the distillery on the tour but the go through the history, the distilling process, and end it off with a tasting of their 3 most famous whiskeys. The tour guide was excellent and made it a very entertaining experience. We did the cocktail class it was really good fun. Our guide Paul brought us through how to make 3 cocktails 2 of which we made ourselves. The flavours, ingredients and whiskey choices were explained really well. After we had made our cocktails (about an hour) we went to a private area of the bar to enjoy them and they served our 3rd cocktail. We also got a book with loads of whiskey based cocktail recipes. We thought it was really good value for what you got EUR60 for a taster shot of whiskey, 3 cocktails (4 as there was extra of the last one!) and the cocktail book. I would definitely recommend the experience. Note though that as you are consuming a decent amount of alcohol on this experience they won't let you do the cask draw after doing this one!"
53,Kellogg's Skyline Croke Park,5.0,"My daughter and I visited in August. We had a really great time visiting Croke Park. The views from on top of Croke Park and seeing Dublin City in a new way was awesome. The visit was complimented by our guide Seamus B. He was entertaining and knowledgeable. I'd recommend anyone visiting Dublin to see the home of GAA Excellent visit to Croker for the 'Skyline' tour. Our guide Cian was really exceptional (even for a south-sider) and his knowledge and passion shined throughout the tour. Highly recommend for locals or visitors alike! I highly recommend the skyline walk weather wasn't great but cleared a little when up there   views of Dublin City and surrounding county are unreal Great guided tour, our guide was very informative knew his stuff about Dublin, Irish weather held off for our duration, even if your afraid of heights take the tour, you feel very safe with the high rails and sturdy walkway, the height above the city really gives you a different perspective of the place and the museum tour at the end is self guided allows you to take in the history of gaa at your own pace Great experience. Great views of Dublin. Easily accessible via public transport. Will definitely recommend to friends. Great experience, whether you are a tourist or a local. The your lasts 90 minutes and offers unparalleled views above Dublin. The guide had great stories to tell that even the locals didn't know about. There is plenty of time to take in the scenery and to pick out your favourite Dublin landmarks. The Skyline tickets also allow access to the GAA museum in Croke Park - a good way to end a visit to the stadium. The tour was different and not scary, as I was expecting, but thoroughly enjoyed it. Owen was an excellent guide, warm speech, with jokes so fast, that I missed a lot until thinking of what he said later.  Amazing views of Dublin. We were late due to Dublin Bus being late/cancelled and they were really accommodating and brought us up to catch up with the tour. Everyone was really lovely from the reception staff, the girl that brought us to join the tour and our tour guide Martin. We went on a sunny day so the views were amazing and you could see far in the distance. We made a day of it with this tour at 11:30, lunch at Shouk at 13:30 (10 minute walk) and a walk up to the National Botanic Gardens after. Cannot be beat especially on a sunny day."
54,Kilmainham Gaol,4.875,"100% buy tickets at least 1.5 months in advance. If you couldn't check their website 24 hours in advance and they may have some availability. Fantastic tour leader and a great place to learn about Ireland history and some stories about political prisoners. Very interesting and informative tour about the more recent history of Ireland and their fight for independence. Our tour guide, David, was excellent and it felt like a storytelling theatre. A bit out of the way from most of the other touristy areas (if taking public transport) but well worth the travel. The tours book out but you can wait for same day cancellations by checking their website between 9:15-9:30. A unique experience of this jail, which has a lot of history to it. The experience comes with a guided tour of the facility and touching stories about the past. When in Dublin it's a site not to be missed. This is a must do while in Dublin. We didn't realize how long in advance these tours book up, but just lucked out on a cancelation.

The tour is very well done, and we had an excellent tour guide who was passionate about the history and made it all the better. A lot of raw history to take in while there. Would reccomend it to anyone. Fascinating place to visit. The guides were very knowledgeable and friendly and we learnt a lot about the history of the place and indeed Ireland in general. Thoroughly enjoyed the tour and would definitely recommend visiting So glad I managed to get a ticket. I completely understand why it's so popular and sells out so quick. Alan was an amazing guide with such passionate delivery. Would recommend anyone to try and go. A must-visit place steeped in history in Dublin.
Remember to book in advance on the site, we had to think twice to visit this place.
An audio guide with dialogues in foreign languages   to be able to follow the visit would really be a plus! It's not easy to follow the guide in English. Excellent tour, worth a visit to learn the history of Ireland. We had Adam as our tour guide, he was excellent; you can tell he is very passionate about the history of Ireland and sharing it with others. Would highly recommend a visit when in Dublin"
55,Luke Kelly Sculpture,4.0,"A beautiful artwork in an unexpected location. Yet there is method in the madness as the rustic industrial feeling of the statue is echoed in the background with a hulking rusting ancient Victorian creation over the water. The hair/beard as metal wires further reinforces this theme. There's over 270 statutes dotted across Dublin. This is my favourite and I'm sure loads of other folk's favourites. The reason is that it reflects its environment & also the expression on Luke's face. Too many public artworks of notable people have them with either neutral facial expression or a gentle smile. This is Luke in the throngs of singing his soul out. It brings it alive in a deep meaningful way. The statue was designed by Vera Klute and is circa 220 cm x 170 cm x 170 cm excluding the stone base. Treated marble was used for the formation of the head while treated metal wire was used to form the hair and beard. The hair is attached through the use of a metal mesh wig while the moustache is made of individual pieces of wire which were drilled into the face of the statue. An initial model with hair was made in smaller near life sized form. A secondary larger statue was then created from plaster but without hair. This second statue was then used for 3D scanning to create the final larger sized version replicated in marble via a 5-axis cnc milling machine in Italy. The appearance is based on a distinctive pose of Luke Kelly with his eyes closed while performing and is said to be taken from a still from his performance of Scorn Not His Simplicity on a show hosted by Jim McCann in 1974 called 'McCann Man'. The statue is said to have cost Dublin City Council EUR80,000. Beautiful statue of our true  legendary folk friend,beautiful music was made by thus man Loved seeing this sculpture of Luke but such a pity about it's location, placed alongside a heavily trafficked road far from the city center, such a shame. Understandably it was relocated due to defamation but this current spot is pretty absurd. Luke Kelly deserves so much better! Horrible looking sculpture in my opinion very strange pose. I would be rushing to see it. Legend We will  never see the likes of him again. Nice Amazing art, man and area of Dublin. G'wan the Sheriffer "
56,Molly Malone Statue,4.5,"The Molly Malone Statue in Dublin, while not surrounded by any particularly notable attractions, offers a glimpse into the heart of Irish folklore. This plain bronze statue commemorates Molly Malone, a figure from a mysterious and enduring Dublin legend. According to the tale, Molly was a beautiful young fishmonger who tragically died of a fever, and her ghost is said to have haunted the streets of Dublin ever since. Though the statue itself may be simple, it stands as a testament to a story that has deeply woven itself into Irish culture, making it a poignant stop for those interested in the rich tapestry of Ireland's mythic past. A beautiful status designed by Jeanne Rayhart. The status is about a song tells the fictional tale of a fishwife who plied her trade on the streets of Dublin and died young, of a fever. In the late 20th century, a legend grew up that there was a historical Molly, who lived in the 17th century. Good spot to visit, take a photo and get your lucky touch on her  Only u should know her story, check the internet as nothing is written there at the statue. If you are around it's ok to go and see Molly, but you must know that this is a kitsch tourist magnet and a ""bosomy version of Molly"" - as The Irish Times called it in a sniffy piece in 1989 when she was fresh from the foundry. Touching her exposed breasts, is practice said to bring good luck, but I believe more in the power of a well poured Guinness... Worth a quick visit to watch all the tourists queueing to have their photos taken by the nice lady and the men cheekily rubbing her expansive bosom. I waited quite some time to take a photo without all the crowds of people. She's quite easy to find and the way there is well signposted. Molly Malone had quite a reputation.   So much so that there are songs about her and a bronze statue.  You can see by the photo that her breasts are discolored from all the hands that have grabbed them over the years. Very sweet and historic (well, erected in 1988 during the Dublin Millennium celebrations) statue of Molly Malone, designed by sculptor Jeanne Rynhart, based on a song telling the fictional story of a fish wife plying her trades in the streets near here in lovely Dublin.

Neither traditional nor historic is the fairly recent custom of tourist, who, according to The Irish Times ""sometime before 2014"", tourists began rubbing the statue's bosom area ""for luck"", with some visitors getting a photo of themselves doing so.
The relatively new practice has been criticsed by some, including Dublin-born singer Imelda May, who associated it with the objectification of women and questioned how ""the only statue in Dublin with breasts is basically assaulted in front of our children's eyes daily"".
(from: Wikipedia) A well-known statue from Ireland whose music I know very well"
57,Musical Pub Crawl,4.625,"Steven and Niles were amazing! They are both incredibly talented professional musicians who also have a wonderful wit about them! We learned so much about Irish music and we were exposed to every possible instrument you could think of. One of the highlights of our trip for sure!! I attended musical pub crawl about 8 years ago with my wife, and upon returning to Dublin I invited my co-workers to join me. While skeptical at first, they were immediately brought in to the musical culture of Ireland through hilarious, lyrical, and emotional stories of the two musicians who led us on a musical tour.
While this may seem touristy, I think this is the best way to experience Irish music - through storytelling, a pint or two, and of course amazing songs and melodies. I highly recommend this. The Musical Pub Crawl Dinner was AMAZING. We went on our first evening in Ireland while on a week-long family vacation. It was such a nice introduction to Irish music/culture. The hosts were so talented and also hilarious-- it felt like part comedy show! The space was intimate and the food was yummy. The dancer, Owen, was SO talented and incredibly friendly. We had our 4 year old along with us and they were all so welcoming & kind to her as well. I would 100% recommend this to anyone traveling to/through Dublin! I attended the same show in September 2022, and the music was outstanding, upbeat, lively. The two performers played multiple instruments and were great storytellers. We had a a fabulous evening and couldn't wait to return. As soon as I knew I was returning to Dublin, I booked a Music crawl expecting another great evening. Well this performance was very disappointing and personally would not attend another crawl, I will look to another option when I return. Fantastic evening entertainment of the highest class. I work with group travel from Sweden and we always start on the day of arrival with the Musical Pub Crawl for our groups.

A fantastic start to the trip to Dublin to learn about Irish music and pub history from very talented musicians. Very entertaining evening which usually ends with most of my happy travelers following the musicians to some session in Dublin

Travel to Dublin without doing a classic Musical Pub Crawl... then you've really missed something. Really fun experience giving background on the basics of Irish music. The two musicians were very talented and our group, including a 14 and 10 year old, had a great time. The performance was informative, funny, and engaging to watch and participate in! We thoroughly enjoyed learning about the musical traditions (instrument/songs) in Ireland and were amazed at the dancing. Great night in Dublin! I read about this tour in a travel guide I purchased and it was hands down the best thing we did in Dublin. We enjoyed listening to the two men play and share about Irish music. The are incredibly talented musicians and did a great job of involving the audience. I highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Dublin."
58,National Botanic Gardens,5.0,"The Dublin Botanical Garden is an absolute gem! Our visit was fantastic, starting with the convenience of easy parking, which made the experience stress-free from the get-go. The garden itself is sprawling and meticulously maintained, offering a serene escape from the city's hustle and bustle.

We were impressed by the variety of plants and beautifully curated sections, each with its own unique charm. The sheer size of the garden means there's plenty to explore, with numerous paths leading to delightful discoveries around every corner. It's a perfect spot for nature lovers and those looking to unwind in a peaceful setting.

One of the highlights for us was the abundance of excellent picnic spots. Whether you're looking for a sunny patch of grass or a shaded nook, there's a perfect spot waiting for you. We were fortunate to visit on a day with perfect weather, which made our picnic all the more enjoyable. We loved the rose garden, which was in full bloom and absolutely breathtaking.

The garden also has well-maintained facilities and friendly staff, adding to the overall pleasant experience. Whether you're a local or just visiting Dublin, the Botanical Garden is a must-see destination that offers a wonderful blend of beauty, tranquility, and convenience. Highly recommended! Always an incredible array regardless of the season. Numerous paths, water areas for Lily pads, rose garden, greenhouses, succulents...

Beautifully laid out and kept pristine. A few more rubbish bins around the park would be nice.

Cafe has wonderful, fresh choices, a great coffee and lovely staff every time.

Parking can be a bit difficult, especially in great weather, but it's to be expected with such a great space! Everyone wants in.  It was lovely to feel the calm and peace of greenery and flowers when only a short distance from the bustling city centre. The garden is very well maintained and has lots of glass houses and pathways to explore. Entry is free! There is also a cafe and restrooms. I went now when the tulips and daffodils bloomed and it's very beautiful, it's worth going. Especially if you have children, they will enjoy the view and the squirrels a lot. There is no entrance or parking fee, the only thing is that if you want to enter the parking lot and if it is full, you have to wait for someone to leave and then enter. Spent all day there. It's totally free to enter, even the greenhouses, and they take excellent care of the grounds. Probably the best park in Dublin Had an amazing time at the National Botanic Gardens! The diverse plant collection is impressive, and the layout is well-designed for exploring. The glasshouses are stunning, especially the Victorian Palm House. Informative exhibits add educational value. Highly recommend for nature lovers! 

I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to reconnect with nature, learn more about plant life, or simply unwind in a serene and picturesque setting.

Kudos to the staff and volunteers for their hard work in maintaining this botanical treasure, and I look forward to returning again soon! Very nice with indoor and outdoor exhibits.  Was free entry the day we went.  Bank holiday may have been the reason.  Public transit getting there was a little confusing, getting back to Dublin city center more so for us first-timers. Beautiful gardens that are really well looked after by their clearly very attentive staff who were working hard on the herbacious beds which were alive with colour. The arboretum was peaceful and perfect to relax in and look at a mix of native and foreign trees."
59,National Leprechaun Museum of Ireland,5.0,"If you enjoy listening to stories full of lore, and a bit of history then you'll love the Leprechaun museum. It's not truly a museum, but it doesn't matter because it engages your imagination in such a way that it does what a museum is supposed to do: educate you on the past so you can understand the present while shaping the future. Our storyteller was awesome! Funny, with a beautiful irish accent and change of tones that made the stories so much more interesting. Come in with an open mind and enjoy the experience. Also, strike up a conversation with Selma, she's at the register and she is so awesome and funny. She'll definitely make your experience a memorable one. Enjoy! I don't rate things often (actually never) but I had to come on and give this place some hype!! This was one of my FAVORITE things I did in Dublin! It was an AMAZING experience! Our tour guide/storyteller was so engaging and was able to engage both the adults and the children in the room! I absolutely loved the stories he told, about the history of Irish folklore and telling us some of his favorite Irish folklore! It was seriously a glorious experience and something I'll always remember and appreciate!! The day tour is very kid AND adult friendly!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! What a delightfully unexpected experience this was during our trip to Dublin! Our seven year old was determined to find/learn about leprechauns during our recent visit and this museum was an exceptional experience. The story telling was riveting, for her and us adults. The design of the museum was incredibly high end and technologically advanced. It was such a fun experience and we are so grateful we went. We highly recommend this to anyone, with or without kids! This was a truly unique experience and it was wonderful! I didn't book in advance, but the staff were very helpful in setting up a booking. The actual museum experience is an exploration into Irish folklore approximately 45 minutes and it's absolutely fascinating! Learning and experiencing folklore from the guide in different ways and hearing the stories was so much fun and I can't recommend this enough! You need to check this out! Perhaps the best museum I have ever visited. The stories, the passionate performance, the expertise displayed by our guide moved me to laughter and tears. Worth every penny. Don't miss this experience when you come to Dublin! This was a cool experience in Ireland. The tour guide was really into it and was able to tell us the stories of the leprechaun. It almost makes you feel like a little kid hearing stories. Definitely schedule your time slot in advance. They only take a certain amount of people per hour I went to experience the darkland tour. It's not a great place if you are going for photos but it was an hour long stories of Ireland. The darkland is what it says, dark, gory and not for children but the storytellers are passionate and engaging and I was hanging off every word. If you like hearing engaging stories this is the tour for you! My father and I visited together and had an absolutely fantastic time.  The focus is really on folklore-- it doesn't have a bunch of artifacts or things to look at.  But what they have put together is really purposeful and guides the storytelling.  Our guide/storyteller, Sarah, was fantastic to listen to.  It made us want to learn more about the legends and mythology of Ireland.  It also made us excited about touring the countryside.  Sarah did a great job, not only telling the stories, but helping us understand how and why the lore changed and became what we presently understand about leprechauns and faeries.  It was so fun, informative, and whimsical."
60,National Museum of Ireland - Natural History,4.875,"My visit to the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History was an immersive journey into the captivating realm of the natural world. Nestled in Dublin, this museum, also known as the ""Dead Zoo,"" is a treasure trove of biodiversity, offering visitors a glimpse into the wonders of nature through its extensive collection of specimens.

As I stepped into the museum, I was greeted by the grandeur of its Victorian-era architecture, which exuded a sense of history and nostalgia. The building itself was a testament to the museum's rich heritage, providing a fitting backdrop for the awe-inspiring exhibits that awaited inside.

The museum's collection spans a wide range of natural history disciplines, including zoology, geology, and paleontology, with each gallery offering a unique perspective on the diversity of life on Earth. From towering skeletons of prehistoric giants to delicate taxidermy specimens of exotic birds and mammals, every corner of the museum was filled with wonders to behold.

One of the highlights of my visit was the museum's iconic ""Balcony of Beasts,"" where rows of glass cases displayed a menagerie of animals from around the world. From lions and tigers to elephants and giraffes, the lifelike dioramas offered a glimpse into the habitats and behaviors of these magnificent creatures.

Moreover, the museum's educational displays and interactive exhibits provided valuable insights into topics such as evolution, ecology, and conservation, making it an enriching experience for visitors of all ages. Whether it was learning about the geological history of Ireland or discovering the intricate adaptations of insects, there was always something new and fascinating to explore.

Overall, my visit to the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History was a truly memorable and enlightening experience. With its extensive collection, informative exhibits, and historic ambiance, this museum serves as a testament to the beauty and diversity of the natural world, inspiring wonder and curiosity in all who visit. Great place. Upstairs was closed for renovations but it was still good. Can be quite busy but lots to see and find out about. Built is the 1800's this building is full of curiosities, (stuffed creatures), that would have been incredibly popular in the victorian era, currently the top floor is closed, due to refurbishment, however, there is still lots to see. It is free and well worth a visit. Awesome Museum! Animals on the ground floor were very cool to learn about and where they may have previously roamed around Ireland. Giant deer skeletons were very epic.

Shame that the two upper floors are closed due to the roof being refurbished as it looks like they had some very impressive stuff up there. Although it sounds like it will be closed for a long time yet. What a surprising treasure! Full of faithfully preserved wildlife from birds, fish to foxes to wild Irish deer (enormous!!) and everything in between. And it's free! Love it! Even love it more after realizing the animals I saw were all real samples, which means that the ""dead zoo"" is legit!
Fancinatdd by some creatures such as the size of an eagle, some super huge fish, Irish giant deer etc.
it was an amazing experience, will definitely visit again  Unique Museum with a big virety of different animals from different habitats. Great for a day out with the children. Also was recently renovated, so the second floor was closed when visited. Small but very A visit to the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History is a truly enriching experience that I highly recommend to all nature lovers and history enthusiasts. From the moment you step inside, you are transported into a world of wonder and discovery.

The museum's impressive collection of natural specimens is both extensive and fascinating. From towering dinosaur skeletons to intricate insect displays, there is something to captivate visitors of all ages. The detailed exhibits are educational and engaging, providing a deeper understanding of the natural world and its biodiversity.

The museum itself is a beautiful architectural gem, with its grand Victorian-style building and intricate ironwork. The ambiance is peaceful and serene, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the wonders of nature at their own pace.

Overall, the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History is a hidden gem that deserves to be explored and appreciated. It's a place where you can learn, marvel, and connect with the natural world in a meaningful way. Don't miss the opportunity to visit this treasure trove of natural history!"
61,National Museum of Ireland-Decorative Arts & History,4.5,"This museum has a very wide range, from silverware through historical clothes to furniture. I had a wonderful time wandering through these converted barracks, taking in the informative displays. And it's free to enter, too. Not exactly what I expected if i am being honest but it was quite peaceful and beautiful regardless. However I encountered a room full of mannequins and have never ran out so fast. Realized I had a phobia that day. They look absolutely realistic and creepy I couldn't even focus on the fashion.

Great museum overall though if you want a peaceful walkthrough A museum with free admission. The exhibition features very good artefacts. However, the display of these artefacts and in particular the lighting could be much better. Great place you need lots of time to look around properly, we'll worth a visit Free entrance check the website for updates before your visit

Large numbers of art crafts displayed

Quiet and beautiful you can spend couple of hours without being disturbed

Jewelry collection in display covers design, metals and timeline It is very nice and huge museum . It is a good museum and please take 1 entire day for this. They also have a small coffee van and a restaurant inside. A must visit! Very helpful staff, lovely curio shop that I returned to the next day to go buy a gift.

Only saw half the museum as our time was limited.
Beautiful exhibitions, curator's choice is a must-see and by far our favourite!

We loved the interactive exhibitions.
The information given was wonderful to read.

We will go back to see more. Nice place to know the history of Ireland. Beautiful and valuable collection."
62,O'Connell Monument,4.375,"The monument to Daniel O'Connell in Dublin is located in the very center.
The monument is dedicated to the legendary Irish politician.
The four winged women located near the monument represent patriotism, courage, eloquence and loyalty.
A very beautiful monument, impressive not only for its details, but also for the history of this famous person. This corner of the city ow lovely. It has some old buildings and nice architecture The O'Connell Monument, a towering tribute to Daniel O'Connell, is not just a statue; it's a powerful symbol of Ireland's struggle for independence and the enduring legacy of one of its most influential leaders. Daniel O'Connell, known as ""The Liberator,"" was a driving force behind the movement for Catholic emancipation and the repeal of discriminatory laws against Catholics in Ireland.

Designed by the esteemed sculptor John Henry Foley, the monument stands as a majestic landmark at the southern end of O'Connell Street, Dublin's principal thoroughfare. It was unveiled in 1882, years after O'Connell's death in 1847, as a fitting tribute to his tireless efforts to advance the cause of Irish freedom and equality.

The monument itself is a masterpiece of Victorian-era sculpture and architecture. At its pinnacle stands a commanding statue of Daniel O'Connell, depicted in a dignified pose, his outstretched hand gesturing toward the future. Surrounding him are four allegorical figures representing the virtues that defined his life and legacy: Patriotism, Fidelity, Courage, and Eloquence. These figures, crafted in bronze, serve as eternal guardians of O'Connell's vision and ideals.

The monument's Corinthian column, rising over 50 feet into the Dublin skyline, is adorned with intricate carvings and ornamental details, a testament to Foley's artistic skill and craftsmanship. At its base, four bronze winged victories hold laurel wreaths, symbolizing the triumph of justice and the enduring spirit of the Irish people.

Over the years, the O'Connell Monument has become more than just a statue; it's a place of pilgrimage, remembrance, and reflection for countless visitors from around the world. It stands as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought for Irish independence and a beacon of hope for future generations.

As Dublin's most iconic landmark, the O'Connell Monument continues to inspire and unite the people of Ireland, reminding them of their shared history and the enduring values of freedom, justice, and equality for all. It remains a testament to Daniel O'Connell's indomitable spirit and his unwavering commitment to the cause of Irish liberation. I love all the monuments along the O'Connell street, making it feel like walking through the Irish history. An unmissable historical monument in Dublin (just by its dimensions already). Its sculptures all around are imposing. Regularly squatted by seagulls at its summit, you can enjoy it day and night Nice monument, must see in Dublin. Unfortunately, there are many drug addicts and criminals there, and one does not feel safe Wonderful monument to a great Irishman, great humanity and true Patriot."
63,Old Liffey Ferry,4.375,"A fantastic family day out, the tour guide is amazing and the water was so nice to sail on when we went. A really enjoyable alternative way to see Dublin, I can't wait to go again, really nice and helpful staff. Sailing is weather permitted, but we were lucky to get a mild day. Highly recommended Nice experience with family or friends to have. Amazing crew members with one of them giving a full history and background of the events that happened here. Perfect during summer holidays but not so pleasant during rainy days as there is no cover. But raincoats are provided on deck incase. Really enjoyed my tour today, even if the weather wasn't the best. Just dress appropriately, and you're set (wool under your raincoat keeps you dry and toasty).

Great to see Dublin from the water and to hear about this particular part of its history from Frank.

Ten out of ten, would recommend! I had a trip scheduled for June 14th at 2:30 pm they sent me an email a few hours before saying it was going to be postponed due to weather conditions and then a few hours later they cancelled it. I have asked for my refund since yesterday with no response at all Even though I have used all possible channels to contact them: IG, FB, telephone and e-mail. Also when I call the phone number that appears on their page I get a tone saying that number does not exist. Wry small very personal. Two get guys. Get a whole new look from the water. They even made my grandsons day.  By making him captain. And letting him take the wheel. Lose the crowds and take a slow ride and get some stories and knowledge of the dock area. Heads up your gps might take you to the wrong place. It's next to the big restaurant boat  Cill Airne. It was great tour along the river, with lots of facts about Dublin. 4 stars out of five because it was raining)) During my visit to Ireland myself and some family took part in the ferry and it was an amazing experience. Our guide Jimmy was very friendly and told us some great stories as well as sharing some of the history of Dublin. Would highly recommend the Old Liffey Ferry to anyone This was a great tour. The guide was local as was his father and grandfather and as a result he had so many local stories to tell as well as a great knowledge of the local history. As a Dubliner, this was a lovely new perspective of the city."
64,Ole Irlanda Tours,5.0,"A highly recommended company for a 12-hour excursion to Belfast from Dublin, very complete and enjoyable. The experience with Ole Irlanda Tours is amazing and you will learn a lot about the history and culture in Ireland. The guide tourist Agustina is very kind and always answer your questions, she knows a lot of about Ireland and she is outgoing and funny in your job :)
Thank you! Excursion to Giant's Causeway, Dunluce Castle and Belfast.
Although the journeys are long, the excursion was made enjoyable thanks to Anna, who spent much of the time on the bus explaining the politics, economy, history and curiosities of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The visit to the castle is good because it has beautiful landscapes and completes the tour.
The stop at the Giant's Causeway lasted just enough time to walk around and see it well.
In Belfast it would take more time but the tour is still quite complete.
They let you eat on the bus. The excursion that Ole tours provided us was wonderful, the guide Ana was wonderful, she taught us everything and told us with passion about the people who love their work. The time in the castle and on the road was enough, if they added half an hour to Belfast at least it would be magnificent. Ana ran and made an effort to make sure everything was perfect. Congratulations to ole tours and Ana, who couldn't be a better guide!! Thank you. Highly recommended! We did 3 excursions and we are delighted.
The guides are very professional, both Sigfri on the route through the Giant's Causeway, Dunluce Castle and Belfast.
Mario in Galway and the Cliffs of Moher and Antonio in Glendalough and Wicklow.
Getting to know part of Ireland with Ole Ireland tours is wonderful. We did the excursion to Dunluce Castle, Giant's Causeway and Belfast with Sigfred and it was fantastic. One of the best guides we have had. He has a tremendous knowledge of Ireland and an exceptional way of telling it. An essential tour if you travel to Ireland, and if you are lucky enough to have Domingo as your guide, in addition to beautiful landscapes you will enjoy some very enriching stories and history of Ireland. The time is very well managed to enjoy many interesting things in the time it lasts. I suppose that if you go with other guides from ""Ole Ireland"" the trip will be just as enjoyable but I can only talk about Domingo, who was the one we had. An unforgettable experience, your guide, Domingo, taught us the history of a great island and its people. A first tour of the area where Game of Thrones was filmed, which despite not having seen it, filled us with passion with its great castles, mansions and routes within that enchanted forest. Congratulations!!! And thanks for helping us on other issues. And double everything in the recommendations."
65,Oscar Wilde House,4.375,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the interior of the house, its preservation, original furniture... Looking around the whole house seemed to bring me back to the life of O Wilde and his family. The house is toured independently, you can stay as long as you want. At the end, a film about Wilde's life is shown and the film leaves a very deep impression. I recommend the tour! too disappointed, the old rooms are transformed into classrooms, the rooms are empty. The information we are given is minimal and not very interesting. Some rooms are very beautiful (like the library) and make up for the visit a little. I don't recommend it if you have little time in Dublin. Lovely place to visit, and get a bit of the story behind Oscar Wilde - specially about his parents, strong characters of Dublin life. The house is beautiful, and if you have the chance, don't miss the guided tour on Saturdays. But the self-guided tour is also great, super recommended. Sadly no current access, due to the students' exam times, but just being at this building of one of the greatest literary giants is humbling enough. What a tragic and beautiful story, passionately narrated by Martin! I really enjoyed the guided tour of the house where Oscar Wilde grew up and spent many years of his life.

Some of the original belongings of the Wilde family are still in place (ie: a collection of books by Oscar and his parents, the Irish oak floorboards, neo-classical reliefs decorating the walls,and coloured windows). It is a different house visit compared to the norm - Oscar's family had to sell the house a long time ago, because despite the success Oscar's father ended up in misery (as well as Oscar himself).

The building is now home of the American College Dublin, with the guided tours about Oscar's life being managed by a registered charity. The funds raised from the house visits are used to cover the house restauration expenses.

I would definitely recommend the visit, the house is still a precious testimony of his life and also the director is so engaging in telling the family anecdotes besides having a wealth of knowledge on Oscar Wilde's incredible life. Really interesting tour, highly interesting to anyone who likes Wilde.
There is not much to see at the house itself, but the tour was 100% worth it. This was the Wilde family home where Oscar Wilde lived from infancy before moving to England - 1855 to 1878.

It is now occupied by the American College in Dublin.

Unfortunately when I was there us was closed so I wasn't able to go inside but I still took pictures from the outside and then visited his memorial statue across the street in the park. No-one can get inside, it is a private college. You see the house only from outside. You can have a look at the beautiful park at the other side and visit the statue."
66,Papal Cross,4.375,"Incredible view of a huge park. Nice for walks! It's like a large cross, but with history & meaning. Great parking and deer surrounding with walks and runs from here single and enjoyable A wonderful monument found at Phoenix Park. The park itself is amazing, but, this specific part of the park is a must visit place. With a large green field is welcoming for a walking. You may love the crows at early noon flying by these fields. Is really beautiful. Impressive view of the park from this high point and with luck you might spot a herd of deer. The cross of course, is a reminder of the papal visit and god's sacrifice for our salvation. I'm so sad.. I walked there during 1 hour and saw nothing. I searched up in the reviews before coming and none said that there's chances to don't see the deer. I saw many pictures of many deer at this place but I presume that they are not here after 5pm and when it's a little bit raining. The bike rent was closing when we arrive and didn't tell us that it's because we can't see anything at this hour. Majestic big steel cross standing at 35 meters erected in 1979 for the visit of pope John Paul II. Lovely big place to spend nice Sunday afternoon with family. You can ride a bike, play football with kids, chill and have a lunch, walk your dog. Beautiful views  from the cross level. Highly recommend this place! Lovely day out with the family.
Love the view on top , make sure to bring a picnic blanket for a lovely picnic day out after eating walk at the large greenfields at the back of the cross and you will see the wild deers .  Perfect for a picnic "
67,Parliament House,4.25,"The House of Lords is closed and you can just view the historic building from outside. The building is a bank now. It's not open to public anymore. The Old Irish Parliment built on College Green Dublin in 1729 by Sir Edward Lovett Pearce and James Gandon. It lasted for 70 years. The British parliment abolished the Dublin in 1800 and incorporated Ireland into the United  Kingdom. Since early 1800s it is a bank. The house of commons is gone but House of Lords still remains and is open to the public  Monday to Friday, 10am to 12 noon. Admisdion is free Interesting Parliament house with no windows. You know why? Because window is a sign of wealth and they've took them out to lower the price for this building. At first I thought this is the parliament of Republic of Ireland and I was wrong... It's now a part of Bank of Ireland and guess what the institution actually acquired it in 1803! Anyway, in case you wonder, the parliament in Irish is called Dail, and the place they meet is in Leinster House. Make no mistake. The name is deceiving : In the past - indeed Houses of Parliament, today - Bank of Ireland HQ.
The complex is centrally located right near the entrance to Trinity College. Interesting architecture and history (no windows?!) . Great as a meeting/starting point for your tour of this area of Dublin. Very cool to see and right at the heart of the city. Conveniently located next to trinity college this site lights up at night and there are many statues out front. Great place to see and good night life. I just passed by the Parliament. THe building look very big and attractive."
68,Parnell Monument,4.75,"The column is great and looks monumental, though it's not actually all that huge. Great monument.

""South face of obelisk has gilt inscription:
""TO CHARLES STEWART PARNELL/NO MAN HAS A RIGHT TO FIX THE/BOUNDARY TO THE MARCH OF A NATION/NO MAN HAS A RIGHT/TO SAY TO HIS COUNTRY/THUS FAR SHALL THOU/GO AND NO FURTHER/WE HAVE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO FIX/THE NE-PLUS-ULTRA/TO THE PROGRESS OF/IRELANDS NATIONHOOD/AND WE NEVER SHALL"" and ""Go soirbhighidh Dia/Eire da clainn"" in Clo Gaelach This monument is to Charles Parnell, the Irish Nationalist, whose legacy eventually lead to independence for Ireland.

The statue itself features Parnell standing, his right arm stretched out as if addressing a crowd, his left hand resting on a draped table. Behind him stands a 17 metre high obelisk with the words inscribed the words ""To Charles Stewart Parnell. No Man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation. No man has a right to say to his country. Thus far shalt thou go and no further"".

The statue has a QR code which you can use to hear a speech made by Parnell. Great monument.

Another one of the monuments of O'Connell street is the statue of Charles Stewart Parnell, revered nationalist political leader. You'll find his monument sitting at the top of O'Connell Street, at the entrance to the square named in his honor. The monument features his famous words, ""No man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation. To say to his country 'thus far shall thou go and no further.'"" It is commonly joked in Dublin that the statue was constructed to point in the direction of the Rotunda Hospital, which was once Dublin's main maternity hospital, the humor being that Parnell was encouraging the Irish Nation to out-breed their enemies. Monument located at the top of O'Connell Street and built in memory of one of Ireland greatest and most known politicians. It's at the top of O'Connell, if you use the Aircoach service (Stop Gresham Hotel/O'Connell Upper), or get on a bus tour, you might as well have a look.
Quite nice to look at at night and the streets aren't so busy then. This tall and beautiful monument (at the junction of Parnell and O'connell) commemorates Charles Stewart Parnell, one of the most important political figures in 19thCent. Ireland. Impressive. One of the historical monuments, free visit. Beautiful!"
69,Pat Liddy's Walking Tours,4.636363636363637,"Such a great walking tour of Dublin! It was the first thing I did when I got there. It really helped orient me to the city, and I learned so much about Irish history in the process! I have used Pat Liddy's Walking Tours for several years when visiting Dublin with my students. Every time we have the best guides! This week we had Fiona, who did an incredible job engaging students and telling stories that were profound and unforgettable, but still kept them quite interested.
Whether a solo traveler, family, or group, I can't recommend Pat Liddy's crew enough - from booking to walking, they go above and beyond.
(As a bonus, if you use them, you get 20% off at The Church restaurant which is a great Dublin experience as well!) I thought this would be a great way to see the sights in Dublin, because the reviews are overwhelmingly positive, but we didn't get to see much at all. Our tour guide was very nice, but she spent so much time talking and telling stories that we didn't have time to actually see anything. By the end of the 2.5 hours she was stopping on random street corners and pointing to where things were, rather than actually taking us to see them. We only saw 3-4 of the stops listed on the website. An overall very frustrating experience.

Updating my response based on my note below: I appreciate your response, Pat. I don't mean to argue. But I do believe I have fair reason to be upset with our experience. Because we did not see half the things you mentioned. I knew what we were supposed to see. But we spent 90 minutes of the 2.5-hour tour inside Dublin Castle, and most of that time was spent standing in one place hearing various stories and histories. Which was not uninteresting -- it just wasn't what we signed up for. We only saw Christ Church from across the street, because we were running low on time. We then did walk through Temple Bar, but our tour guide only pointed to where River Liffey was -- we never saw it or crossed any bridge. So we did not see the O'Connell Monument, the post office or anything on the North side of the city. And we never went past the Houses of Parliment or Trinity College. Our last stop on the tour was The Old Storehouse. After that, we were dropped back off at the Tree of Gold statue. I have no doubt these tours are typically great, based on all the positive reviews. And again, our tour guide was very nice. Had I not expected to see all the things you pointed out, I wouldn't have been as disappointed. But I expected to see a lot of things, and we skipped half that you listed. I hope in the future that our guide will be able to time things out better so that she can get to more of the stops promised on the website. We had a brilliant tour with Colm. Very knowledgeable and entertaining (songs, jokes, stories). Brilliant to hear the history, which is lesser known to us English, and not only see the major sights, but hear/see all the hidden stuff. Colm was brilliant, warm and friendly, and i loved the inclusion of a bit of sport. He even offered us up a couple reccomendations for the rest of our trip, which proved a hit. Highly recommended and hopefully you get Colm as your guide! Just Wow!  Incredibly interesting and well informed local guide Eoin brought the history of Dublin alive.  We thoroughly and unreservedly recommend this tour to anyone wanting an introduction to Dublin.  Tremendous value for money and great fun into the bargain.  What more could you ask Wonderful, wonderful experience! A perfect way to see and learn about the city. Our tour guide, Eoin, was nothing short of great. His knowledge, joy, and humor were infectious. We left the tour in love with Dublin,  highly recommend! Enjoyed an utterly splendid Walking Tour of North Inner City, Dublin on 31 January 2020. Blessed with glorious sunshine, the erudite Pat Liddy brought us on a great tour around this fascinating area,  recounting the history of the area, its regeneration (in parts), anecdotes. We were a group of 13 and we spent an exceptional, interesting, hugely informative two hours. Truly, walking about is the best way to appreciate any city. One would do this abroad, lovely to explore our own beautiful capital. Pat is a great author, with books to his name; he has been a newspaper columnist & is a talented artist too. In addition, a real gentleman. He does a wonderful range of Walks & has a fine website. Thank you, Pat. I loved our day out. Liam was an amazing tour guide!!  He was so knowledgeable about the architecture, history, and food eateries around Dublin. Would recommend for anyone visiting Dublin for the first time!! If you want a proper guided tour with someone who doesn't shout and carry on but has plenty of craic and knows his subject inside out then go on a Pat Liddy Walking Tour. The man is an absolute gent and is a veritable legend at this stage. What he doesn't know about Dublin is not worth knowing. Highly recommended - and then some. Brilliant tours. Remembered many years after. Highly recommended every time someone asks me what to do in Dublin nan"
70,Pearse Lyons Whiskey Distillery,5.0,"Explore one of the best distilleries Ireland in Dublin's liberty district. Inside an accurately restored church where you can sample Irish whiskey made the old way. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The tour was very insightful. Cannot recommend this whiskey distillery enough. It's based in a formerly working church, which is incredible. I bought my ticket ahead of time to guarantee a spot. You can choose a few types, which basically means how many whiskeys you would like to try. I did 5 and it was a good amount. One of them was actually a gin. The tour was very informative and at the end is a very nice gift shop. Decent prices for whiskey I think. Friendly staff. Very nice tour of the distillery with an amazing and varied selection of tastings. I particularly enjoyed the more history focused aspect of the tour. Had an amazing time.

Edit: also did the gin class today and it was amazing. It was both interesting and fun. Plus the guide was very informative and it was overall a great experience as well. A unique experience of a distillery tour, but within a repurposed church. I booked onto this last minute after finding it a stone's throw away from the Guinness Storehouse and I'm glad I did! John our tour guide was knowledgeable, passionate and humourous, taking us on the journey of the church that now is a distillery. I loved hearing about the past (which appeased the history buff in me), present and future on a fast pace yet relaxed tour, that culminated with drinking whiskey (and gin) where the pews would have been in the church. I booked the legacy tour, which was cracking and gave an insight into to most of their offer. The attention to detail in the design within the church is a testament to the love, sweat and tears that has gone into this exciting concept. Definitely worthwhile! BEST DISTILLERY!!!!!!!! We visited several beer breweries and whiskey distilleries and this was BY FAR the best. I would highly recommend this tour above any other. Other places such as Guinness can handle a lot of people but this one was the most informative and best experience! We booked a tour online had no wait time. Our tour guide JOHN was phenomenal. Very professional, personable and friendly. John is very knowledgeable and provided a riveting tour on the history of the land, church, and whiskey. Although I had been to other tours and museums I did not fully understand the process behind distilling. John explained it in such a way that it clicked for me and it was just a valuable tour. I absolutely loved the added history of the location of the graveyard. He even added historical context of other distilleries, monuments and historical figures. The church in which the distillery is absolutely breathtaking. Also...the whiskey was very good. I throughly enjoyed the tasting and discussing the flavors and experiences elicited. We also added drops of water to the whiskey which was so fun to experiment with. 10 out of 10 would recommend the tour with John. It was certainly one of the most enjoyable moments in Dublin. I now feel so much more educated in whiskey, gin and the Pearse company. I look forward to experiencing more of Pearse whiskey.
Thanks John! We really enjoyed the distillery tour!! Having done a few gin distillery tours in Ireland, this was my first whiskey one, and it was excellent. Hubert, the host, was outstanding and very knowledgeable. Learnt a lot about Irish whiskey. The tastings were fantastic as well. This is a beautifully restored old abandoned church.  The Pearse did a great job restoring the church and converting it to a family owned distillery.   It now has a visitors center and a tasting tour of its whiskey and gin.  The tour was good with a historic explanation of the important ties of the St James Church to the Pearse family. Great experience at the Pearse Lyons Distillery! Was lucky enough to score a private tour with Bernard and tasting with Sebastian. The tour was a great blend of history as well as interesting insight into the whiskey making process along side generous tastings - highly recommend."
71,Phoenix Park,4.875,"I went to Phoenix Park on a sunny day, and everything was beautiful! The park is huge, with plenty of space for walking and running. Lots of families with children and people of all ages. The deer are one of the main attractions; they are used to people, so you can get really close. I also loved the organic garden; I wish I had one like that in my backyard, haha. Largest park in a European city that is great for playing, enjoying, walking, biking and spotting deer and various birds. It also have a a zoo, the President's house, papal cross, flower garden and other things as well. Strongly recommend.

I loved the park and felt it was very well designed as there is a clear straight road the cars could take making it easier to go to each part of the park. There is also a public bus that goes through the park in case you don't have a car.

You can also easily play games in the park grounds. Nice place to have a walk and enjoy the nature. There are several tracks to walk so you can choose which routes you want to take.

As the park is huge, it doesn't get crowded. Along the way there are some benches to sit and relax under the sun.

I was lucky to see some deers resting and eating around the park.

Definitely will go back when in Dublin. Very very large park! We had come to find the deer. We wandered in vain for more than an hour when suddenly when we decided to leave we came across them  very beautiful park in any case especially at this time of year! Beautiful 
So peaceful and yet full of life at the same time.
Families, runners, and people walking their dogs.
Parking at certain spots.
Lots to do and see, quite a big park. This is a fantastic amenity. A wonderful green space within the city of Dublin.A meditation haven.Sports a fine herd of deer,so I am told..but no luck for me. It has many pathways  both hard and soft underfoot. Perfect for indulging in outdoor activities ,e.g walking,jogging etc,.It houses Dublin  Zoo, The American Ambassador's residence,sports areas,children play area, among others. Has monuments,sculptures and the  Papal Cross. We'll worth a visit in any season. Incredible and huge Phoenix Park, located in Ireland.
We were here last year in the summer.  This is a must visit place.
But I warn you right away, you need to walk a lot here). You can also rent bicycles at the gate.
As soon as you enter the park, you see many different trees, shrubs and flowers.  Somewhere in the middle of the park there are already large green meadows where you can relax and enjoy the views of various historical monuments.
There is a zoo, a cricket club and various cafes. The park is very large, so it will take more than one day to explore everything. My friends and I purposefully walked to a clearing with deer, many said that we might be unlucky and there wouldn't be any, we wandered for a very long time and finally found it.
It was simply an unforgettable and fabulous moment. We saw a herd of deer roaming freely. We were able to pet them and feed them.
It was the most amazing walk through probably the largest park in Europe. Highly recommend visiting for a breezy walk, to have deep conversations, or just lay back looking at the sky and bird watching. I'm positive there used to be more trees, sad that they're minimal atleast where we walked."
72,Phoenix Park Visitor Centre,4.5,"Love this area, very good for given your dog a good run around. Most dogs off the leash which is really good to see, as I'd prefer my dog off her lead. Coffee places close by too. Nice and peaceful especially when the weather is bad, not a single person around  The visitor centre has a two storey exhibition detailing the history of the park over the last five centuries. It's free to visit.
The centre also has a cafe with indoor and outdoor seating and a large car park. It's next to the walled Victorian garden, which is also worth a visit and is also free. We were pleasantly surprised by this small but proud and informative exhibition. Some interesting info about this area and park. Well worth a visit if you're in the area.
Find out about the historical past and local information. Nice food and drinks area as well. Staff very helpful Amazing Personal and a cute exhibition bout the history of Phoenix Park. The tour of the castle is really worth it. But it is really cold in there so bring a jacket. Great centre, good food, ice cream. Very busy, too crowded at the weekend - be aware. With the Ashtown castle and Victorian style kitchen garden, with a maize park it is perfect for families with kids. For a nice sunny day outside with lots of dog walkers,perfect walk. Very huge park,fun for outdoors activities What a fantastic experience especially seeing the deer and cute little hole in the wall pub , recommend taking the family especially on a sunny day"
73,Raconte-moi l'Irlande,5.0,"A tour guided by Aurelie, who is French by birth and Irish at heart. Introduced us to the city and history of Dublin. She answers all the questions. A big thank you to her for sharing her city. We visited Dublin this morning with Aurelie. We highly recommend it, it was a great experience! We were in Ireland for a weekend and Aurelie allowed us to discover places that we would not have been able to visit on our own. She listened and answered all our questions. We feel the love of Ireland when it tells History  How lucky I was to come across your opinions about Aurelie. Thanks to this I trusted and we were truly delighted. There were 10 of us listening to him introduce us to his adopted city. At home in the North of France we know how to recognize real people, those who speak from the heart. And Aurelie won us all over unanimously. Thank you !! Looking forward to the second visit on Saturday  (secret and confidential visit). Visit made Tuesday morning with my 2 teenagers, Aurelie knew how to make this visit lively and interesting for everyone. In 2.5 hours, she introduced us to pieces of Irish history through its essential sites. Anecdotes, good addresses, we feel that Aurelie loves Dublin and we don't see the time passing.
We will be happy to meet her again for a visit to Howth on Friday morning! We made 2 visits with Aurelie during our stay in Ireland. We loved and learned a lot about the city of Dublin. Aurelie tells us with passion the history and secrets of her favorite city. A must-do during your stay!!! A visit perfectly suited to our wish to discover Dublin during a short stay.
Aurelie gave us information throughout the visit and wise advice to continue our stay.
We will call on her again for a future visit. If you want to know the main sites to see with clear explanations, you are in the right place! Aurelie showed us around Dublin during a great 2.5 hour walk. We have more about Ireland and its history. I highly recommend. A real, friendly, no-frills discovery! Aurelie loves Dublin and Ireland and shares her passion with us! To do without hesitation when arriving in Dublin."
74,St Patrick's Cathedral,5.0,"Highly recommend not only to catholics but to all. Beautiful architecture, stained glass, old relics &  flags. Hands on area for charcoal rubbings and sensory area to hands on the stone, embroidery and tiles. So much incredible history. Our family has an ancestor buried there which made it quite special.
Easy to find, walkable, guided tours or self guided with head sets. Staff was helpful and friendly. Cute gift shop as well. founded in 1191, St. Patrick's Church in Dublin is a beautiful example of Gothic Revival architecture and one of the few buildings left from the medieval city of Dublin. The stunning stained glass windows cast constant rainbow colors across the pews. It's a beautiful cathedral and worth the quick audio guided visit. She started Catholic but ended up Anglican during the reformation and remains as such. Jonathan Swift is buried here. Wow! Wow! I can I live here please? This place is so magical.  Very well done, worth every euro. Breathtaking....I believe I spent over 2 hours here . There are bathroom facilities, lockers for your personal items. Booklet to tell you about each magnificent piece of artwork etc. The photos do not do this castle justice. It's much better in person. When I think Irish cathedral, this is it. Very beautiful to explore and has a great audio guide to explain the vast history.

It does cost 10 euros as an adult to get in, if your not used to paying to visit churches. I am so glad we were able to visit this gorgeous and ethereal Cathedral while visiting Dublin, Ireland! It is absolutely breath-taking, and has so much history. Our tour guide showed us some very exciting parts of the Cathedral like the statue of St. Patrick in his baptizing position, the door where the term ""changing his arm"" comes from, the spot where the President of Ireland sits for service, and many more historic spots. This Cathedral is rich with history and Irish heritage, and is a perfect place to stop in when visiting Ireland's capitol! Although it was crowded, this cathedral is beautiful! The mosaic floor alone is worth seeing. Make sure to visit the free park outside to see the entire cathedral from the outside. St Patrick's cathedral is one of the main attractions in Ireland. It speaks of its  Catholic and Anglican heritage. It has many Stain glass windows and chapels. You need to pay for the visit and you won't be disappointed. It was interesting to know that Johnathan swift, the author of Gulliver's travels was a dean here and buried at St Patrick Cathedral. The cathedral has various daily services. It also also has various depictions of St Patrick This Gothic building with its thousands of beautiful stained glass windows was especially notable for me on account of it being Jonathan Swifts final resting place. People of my age read his classic  Gulliver's Travels as a child, though I didn't know the book was written in 1726. Swift lived till he was 77, quite a feat in those days. And it's attributed to his bathing daily and exercising!"
75,St. Audoen's Park,4.375,"Another hidden gem in Dublins fair city . Two minutes from Christ Church Cathedral. Plenty of space for all the family Lovely site centrally located on the St. Audeons church grounds.. Well worth of visit during sightseeing or simply for a park break.
Only downside is fair amount of unsociable individuals so be vigilant. Pleasant well maintained park that lies adjacent to the exquisite little church of the same name. Excellent place to relax for ten minutes or so from the hard grind of Dublin sightseeing! Audeon's Park sits alongside St. Audoen's Church at Cornmarket in Dublin city center. The park features Dublin's original stone walls and the last surviving Visited on the truly superb Dublin Ghost Bus tour. Excellent if you're a bit of a ghoul. Rainy evening, superb storyteller frightening us with the story of the Green Lady who haunts the steps there. This beautiful park in the centre of the city features the most extensive remaining stretch of the original City Wall. Love this place. Recently reopened following refurbishment, this is a nice little park with an interesting selection of sculptures that can be interacted with. My two year old loved playing with them! Cute little park!! Went on a ghost bus tour lovely park and so qiute beautiful old church with lots of history with it def go and see the area not to far from Christ church  chasing after the famous green lady but unfortunately she wasnt around"
76,St. Kevin's Park,4.375,"Well tended Park, in Church Ruin and graveyard. Plenty of benches and bins.
A popular dog walking destination from what I observe.
Unfortunately the adjacent ex-college lands are being burrowed plummeted and pounded by a barrage of augers and excavators, so the 'peace' won't be around till I'd guess 2024/5!
Worth an exploratory visit.
I'd expect Sat. or Sun might be a safe quiet bet?!.
It also skirts Opium nightclub and a laneway of some great grafitti Lovely, quiet area, great for take a break, when you want to be alone with nature or have a picnic with family or friends  Nice little park with an ancient church ruin and tombstones the seventeen hundreds. It's not big, but there's a lovely tree in the midst of it. Visited the park, a part of a ghost (bus) tour. The now park was once a porpers grave yard several hundred years ago mostly full of 28 century plage bodies and some higher ranking church officials, and the shell of a burned our church that our tour guide Vicent explained was where The Duke of Wellington was baptised. Anyway the graves were cleared by the local council and the place turned into quite park. Vincent told us many ghost stores about the place and who grave robbers took bodies with a mini sized coffin and tour volunteers laying in a the demo coffin.
The park is well maintained if you need a quite effective moment, but a little out of the way. It's so amazing that so many people from Dublin don't even know about here. That's probably a good thing. Beautiful place to visit played there as a nipper happy memories . Nice quite small park in middle of city. Lots of historical interest. Perfect spot for some peace and solitude on a busy day. A small and cute park not far from the city center. It is quiet and pretty clean."
77,St. Patrick's Park,4.75,"Great picnic spot. Beautiful park adjacent to St. Patricks cathedral. Also has a pet friendly Tram cafe. This park is absolutely beautiful! You could spend all day just sitting there and enjoying the peace and serenity. A lovely park and Cathedral. Quiet and very well maintained.
It has occasional small markets and a lovely coffee shop in the corner. This is actually a nice little park to relax in with lots of different places to sit and you're just a short walk to the city centre Such a calm and peaceful place in the center of downtown. I spent few moments there in peace. Kids were playing in the playground. Visitors were watching and chatting. There is a cafeteria in the area for coffee, drinks, snacks and ice cream It was a sunny day. A lot of people hanging out on the lawn and benches. We enjoyed our coffee from the Tram caffe beside ST. Patrick cathedral which is by itself is a mesmerizing view.
Worth the visit! It was sunny, there were a lot of people there and this evening I was making music St. Patrick's Park in Dublin is a lovely spot for a relaxing day out. Tucked away near St. Patrick's Cathedral, it's an easy walk from the city center or a nice break if you're exploring the area.

Getting into the park is free, making it a budget-friendly option for a leisurely stroll or a picnic. The greenery and well-kept gardens provide a peaceful escape from the urban hustle. It's a perfect place for families, couples, or solo travelers looking for a quiet corner in the city.

There are benches scattered around, ideal for soaking up the fresh air or enjoying a snack. The playful sculptures add a touch of whimsy, making it a fun space for kids. The park is well-maintained, creating a clean and inviting environment for visitors."
78,St. Patrick's Tower at The Digital Hub,4.625,"Amazing building built circa 1757. It was the largest smock windmill Europe. It's one of the last remaining buildings of the original George Roe Distillery. There's a pear tree planted at the base dating back to 1850, and it's one of the oldest fruit bearing trees in Ireland. One of the Dublin city most famous symbols and definitely a must see, if you are in Dublin! Cool looking tower! Nothing special but a nice small cafe at the base. I think just the walk to get here is very nice. You pass a lot of churches you night not have initially planned to visit! There is not much to see are there no public access to the interior.

For some reason my father always referred to this as the Guinness Malting Tower. However, this structure was not owned by Guinness and in fact it was the largest smock windmill Europe and it was and was built as part of the Roe whiskey distillery in 1757. The Thomas Street Distillery, run by the Roe Family, was once the largest in the Britain and Ireland, with an output of two million gallons per annum at its peak. After the distillery was closed in 1926, some of its buildings were purchased and incorporated into the Guinness Brewery.

A few years ago Diageo, the owners of Guinness, resurrected the original brand and launched a non-chill filtered, 45% ABV premium blended whiskey under the name ""Roe & Co"" in March 2017. Many historical references are showing that a Sylvester Costigan was the rightful owner of St Patrick's Tower. Costigan also owned a distillery on Thomas St that some 2,000 United Irishmen rebels hid in during the 1803 rebellion under Robert Emmet. The same Sylvester Costigan is still buried at St James' Church in Dublin which is being converted into a distillery now. Historical evidence shows Costigan was the one who rebuilt the windmill in 1810. Roe dynasty appears to have swindled it from Costigan. I believe history is trying to cover up a theft of property and rightful ownership to the Costigan dynasty. A former Windmill. A landmark that is visible from across the city and can be used as a help in finding the Guinness store house which is just across the street (although the entrance is a bit further).
The tower itself is not accessible but is lit-up on holidays in appropriate colours eg green for St Patrick's day.
There is a coffee shop nearby which has a good coffee. St Patrick's Tower is located on Thomas Street in Dublin City. It was built in 1757 and was the largest smock windmill in Europe used to power the Roe Whiskey Distillery. A smock mill is a type of windmill that consists of a sloping sides that resembled smocks worn by farmers in the Netherlands, where their construction originated. George Roe and Company started their company here in the 1750's and by 1887 it had expanded into the largest distillery in Europe. At that time the Thomas Street Distillery covered 17 acres and was producing 2 million gallons of whiskey annually. Roe Whiskey was exported to the United States, Canada and Australia as well as to all over Europe. The Row family became so wealthy that they even funded the restoration of Christ Church Cathedral. By the turn of the new century however the whiskey industry went into a global decline. By 1926 the distillery had ceased producing whiskey but held large quantities of unsold stock in storage. In the mid 1940's the company finally dissolved and in 1949 the next door neighbours, a little unknown company called Guinness bought the entire site! This is now the Digital Hub of Dublin where technology, media and internet companies are encouragedto set up and thrive together in a business community. Very beautiful tower. The alley next door is charming."

81,"The Ark, Dublin",5.0,"My daughter and I visited the Ark Museum for the first time and we saw the Pinocchio exhibition. It was very well made with several books from different periods and languages   and with several objects. Anyone will realize that it is an unforgettable story. To finish the exhibition we have access to the workshop, for me it was the most important part of the exhibition for young children to their grown-ups, any visitor can materialize with collages or drawings what they saw in the exhibition accompanied by a talented coordinator. It was an incredible experience. We can't wait for the next exibition. We attended the making of mollie and it was absolutely brilliant! The 5 actors were amazing and do really brought the story to life! We love the Ark theatre and go to as many shows as we can! Highly recommend visiting if you can every time we(mom with 4kids) visit,
i feel very warm kindness from all staffs thanks again. The ark is the best place to visit with kids in Dublin. One of my favourite places ever! I'm delighted that someone thought about creating a perfect banter for children. It's like a magical building at the heart of Temple Bar, with an absolutely stunning interior, fantastic staff (there's a particular nice girl, with long and independent hair, who's so nice, that she restors your faith in humanity) and great events. We love their art and musical workshops, was proud to take part in an amazing project called Put yourself in a portrait (2016 & 2019) but what swept us from our feet was Emil and the detectives performance. Never seen anything so engaging and magical in my life! Thank you so much for building fantastic memories! Fantastic place to bring children up to pre-teen age. Currently running an exhibition of board games with chance to play them too! Highly interactive place with patient staff. It's also free entry. Some workshops as well, though very limited capacity requiring booking will in advance. Fantastic show - The making of Molley. Niamh McAllister was brilliant! Great place with very friendly staff and all geared to children! Loved it!! The ark is an amazing project. Built to entertain kids of all ages. Friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommended for families and spending a creative fun day Accomodating, friendly and supportive staff. Accessable space for wheelchair users. Thoughtful and insightful creative and cultural productions."
82,The Book of Kells Experience,4.5,"It's an amazing book and the museum tour is worth your time (if not the fee). But you only get to see one page of the Book, so they should call it ""the Page of Kells"". We had the tour without the ""experience"" virtual reality part, so that was probably worth getting if you want to see the book in greater detail.  And the library upstairs was awesome but all the books are almost gone for preservation. See it before they are all gone! Note there is no bathroom until you exit the tour so keep that in mind. The Book of Kells library at Trinity College Dublin is an absolute gem! This historic treasure trove showcases the stunning craftsmanship of medieval artists with its beautifully illuminated manuscripts. Walking through the library feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by centuries-old texts and intricate designs. It's a fascinating glimpse into the past and a must-visit for anyone interested in history or art. The atmosphere is so serene, and there's this sense of awe knowing you're in the presence of something truly special. Trust me, it's an experience you won't forget! Amazing experience!
The library is jaw-dropping! Unfortunately many books were taken out for digitalization.
I want to thank you, our tour guide, for the great wall around the campus and interesting stories!
Be sure to buy tickets a few days in advance. This please is must visit. June 2024- We loved the Trinity Long Room, but aren't religious so the Book of Kells was not a big deal to us. Things to know: You must book tickets in advance and they cost! We didn't know this, we arrived in the morning and were able to book for the evening. They do offer a family deal for entry. The books in the Long Room are being removed to salvage/repair/store. Only two sections had actual books in them. Still fully worth it to see the room, but would be way more impactful with all the books. From the information available, it does not sound like the books will ever be returned to the Long Room. They have added the sculptures of four women to the room (full of sculptures of men), so that was nice. Also, it's hot in there. Like, really really hot. And it was not an uncomfortably hot day in Dublin. We actually liked Marsh's Library better- the oldest library in Dublin where James Joyce sat in one of the chairs you can sit in and you can check out the desk where Bram Stoker studied maps of Transylvania. The Book of Kells Experience. The art of book making, which is presently exhibited at Trinity College. The Book is over 1,000 years old. Everything was written and drawn by hand. The detailing of the drawings is simply amazing. The history of the creation of this book is very interesting, the materials from which this book is made, the paint which used to write and paint this book. A visit to the Long Room is also impressive. Despite the fact that most of the books in the library are under restoration, this is just incredible! The number of books, the organization of space, the busts of scientists, the atmosphere of the library itself. A must see if you are in Dublin. The ticket costs 21.5 euros. It is better to take in advance. Parking lots around are quite expensive, sometimes it is quite difficult to find free parking lots. This should be kept in mind Very nice place for a free visit in the main outdoor courtyard. The interior of the famous and very old library is accessible but requires a fee. The cost of the visit is a little expensive but contributes to the restoration and maintenance of the books. Books of Kells Experience is magnanimous. The beautiful library holds several first edition copies of many significant books over centuries. The minute you step into this library, the atmosphere of this place transports you to a different world. This feels as though in movies. There is an entry fee and this library is currently closed for renovation. Do check their website before you plan on visiting. OK, I love this place. The long room with the great globe hanging from the ceiling and the long room reimagined or just incredible and worth a visit alone. Then the book of Kells itself was interesting/. We also walked around part of the campus and enjoyed the day it was beautiful there were several people who must be having a graduation ceremony taking pictures outside this is definitely worth a visit if you are in Dublin"
83,The Famine Memorial,5.0,"Very thought provoking and emotional memorial to the Great Hunger. The statues are very well made and their looks make you feel anxious and grateful for what you have. The historic Famine Mural is a poignant and visually striking testament to Ireland's past. The mural's detailed artwork skillfully captures the emotions and struggles of a significant period in history. Located in [specific location], it serves as a powerful reminder of resilience and the importance of acknowledging our shared heritage. The mural's vivid depiction and historical significance make it a must-see for both locals and visitors interested in Ireland's rich cultural tapestry. There is an incredible monument, the human figures represent the great famine caused by the potato disease, between 1845 and 1849. About two million people died and another two million emigrated from the island. A work of art accessible from the street not far from the museum grocery store. It hits the guts and makes us think about Irish history Sad to read and also very sad that are so many criminals in this area targeting tourist. Very moving momument to the Irish Famine. The structures of various people and a dog. Stands on the river near the docks. Definitely should visit. A readerboard is also there with a description of the event in Irish history. Still very much present in the national psyche of Ireland: the heart rendering Famine Memorial in Dublin let's one share a glimpse of the pain and sorrow the people of this country experienced not too long ago. Definitely worth a visit. Very well done sculptures.

One of the first groups of emigrants took this path on March 17, 1846, on St. Patricks Day. A very touching memorial that summarizes the Irish potato famine in the 1850's.  These striking statues are poignant, and are moving as well a testament of what happened..  there is no charge to come and view these statues, which overlook the Liffey river."
84,The Garda Museum,4.5,"Small but a wonderful experience.  Lots of history about policing in Ireland.  That said it should take 20-30 minutes so see around but for an educated person with any interest at all it would be nearer one hour!  Totally free and I cannot recommebd it enough! Great Irish Police Museum, free museum like many in Dublin.
I highly recommend it, exclusively in English Very interesting museum which describes the complicated history of the RIC and Garda. Lots to read, lots of artifacts. Perfect spot for history buffs and those who like to wander off the beaten track. Very good museum small but full of historians items On your way for a visit to Dublin Castle you meet this interesting Museum of Ireland's National Police Service, surely deserving everyone's respect and support. After checking their website to see if they were open or if I needed to book in advance, we arrived only to be told that they were closed without any notice. Very disappointing especially when you come with kids Lot's of history. Very informative. Worth a visit. Great little museum. A well spent 30+ minutes. And it's free.  We almost missed it because the door was locked. Found out you have to ring the bell to be buzzed in."
85,The Gravedigger Bus Tour,4.5,"This tour was very fun and spooky  if you're not scared and love spooky stuff, then attending spooky entertainment is highly recommended. it was worth the money but there's a few small disadvantages,  the blood shot was an unknown syrup mixed with vodka, which wasn't very enjoyable in my personal opinion and personal taste, and the history tour outside of the bus wasn't as interesting as we didn't go inside the buildings we visited and just stood outside listening to the history which makes it more boring. Such a great tour,  Emma was amazing as was Dan a the bus driver.  Taking a picture of my daughter in front of the bus and Emma photo bombed it.  Talk about go above and beyond.  Loved it go if you get chance you won't be disappointed We had great frightening fun! The actress and the actor have been fabulous  the locations too, thanks for the tour! Just amazing experience, actors on bus Dan and Ashling were so good these guys should be on broadway  also a big shout out to bus Driver Sean  who was very friendly and informative
Highly recommend you go on this tour The actors were nice and enthusiastic.  The problem was the manager/driver.  He was full of excuses for the few problems that occurred on the tour.  This included a patron that had a party of 3 and the seats were changed.  This family had asked to get their same seats and the crowd was not helping.  All were easy to resolve and have the talent laugh it off and make all happy.  But the driver, who was clearly in charge, made unnecessary excuses blaming this, that and the other.  This family had left the tour and made things feel a little sad.  Further, it made no difference to the manager.  Disappointing. Absolutely amazing tour group! The bus was decked out like a haunted house on wheels! They had some great guides in spooky make-up and costumes take us around the city and give us a terrifying and educational tour about some of the scariest bits of the history of Dublin, Ireland. No spoilers, but we had a phenomenal time! 10/10 would go again! What a fun night!! Everyone does such a wonderful job. You are so into the stories and the good scary fun you forget your on a bus.  Must go!!! This is a really great, historical tour of Dublin! The actors are amazing and so dedicated to their work- and the bus driver is the coolest guy! We highly recommend this tour!:) plus the shots at the end of the tour are definitely a bonus"
86,The Irish Rock 'n' Roll Museum Experience,5.0,"We hadn't been to the museum before despite being regular visitors to Dublin. We loved it. It is a fascinating and eclectic experience, which includes not only the more usual rock and roll memorabilia, but also included interesting 'oddities' such as Michael Jackson's pyjama top and Phil Lynott's school report card. All brought together by the passion and gentle storytelling of our fabulous tour guide, Alan. Would definitely visit again, thank you so much. What a lovely experience! Our tour guide was Bryan and he was amazing. Very friendly, full of interesting facts and willing to answer any questions. If you want you can grab a beer in their bar and bring it along with you. You'll see a lot of amazing instruments and musical equipment, and also watch a short film about Irish music history.
You will learn a lot from Bryan so don't miss it when you're in Dublin! Visit if you want to learn a lot about Irish Rock N Roll culture, listen to music and become a real fan of Irish music 

One of the best museum I visited in Dublin, thanks to our great Tour Guide Alan! He is the best and introduced us to the Irish Rock ,N' Roll culture! He is an extremely knowledgeable person with great sense of humor! The Museum itself has a lot to offer from the younger beginners to the well-familiar Rock N Roll fans!  I definitely recommend to visit that Museum once you are in Dublin! Enjoyed the visit. Great selection of Irish rock memories. Being a Thin Lizzy fan I was delighted to see the collection in the recording room. Highly recommended Amazing experience at this one of a kind museum, definitely a not to be missed Dublin attraction!
The tour was absolutely captivating, funny and informative and we heard a lot of interesting stories from the best guide ever, Alan! Thank you sir!
Even got a mini live performance from one of his colleagues, how about that?
If you love music, you definitely must check this museum out, you'll have a great time here!
Tip: the entrance in the museum is through the bar. Our tour guide was Emily, she was amazing, funny and just such a lovely person. You learn so much about Irish musicians and also get to interact with instruments as well! Amazing.  Huge U2 fan so this was a must stop. I was blown away then I first walked into the U2 room. Was really informative on many other artists as well. So much interesting information and memorabilia in the museum. We loved hearing the stories behind all the great music.  Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable. It's an excellent experience!"
87,The Jeanie Johnston: An Irish Famine Story,5.0,"I visited Jeanie Johnston famine ship with a group of my students and we simply loved the tour. Our tour guide Owen was very skilled, such a great storyteller! The tour was fun and engaging. My kids truly enjoyed this experience and so did I. Highly recommend! This ship called the Jeanie Johnston - mind you this is a replica as the original sank -  tells the story of the Irish famine and the people who fled Ireland to embark on a gruelling voyage in the hope of a better life in the US. It's a very well put-together 50 min program with knowledgeable guides who take you through the ship's history including real life stories of passengers. The Jeanie Johnston was actually called the miracle ship as it suffered no casualties because of its compassionate owner, its equally compassionate captain and a doctor on board (apparently the only ship with a doctor on board). I The Jeanie Johnston was a brilliant place to visit. You are guided (you must take a guided tour) around a replica of a ship which took Irish emigrants fleeing the Great Hunger to North America, learning about the famine's history and the stories of the ship, crew and passengers. Our knowledgable guide Steve handled the subject with tact, intelligence and a much-needed sprinkling of Irish humour. Superb. I'm a Dublin native. My family and clan lived in Ireland going all the way back to the 15th century.

Yesterday I brought my Italian partner to the Jeanie with the hope it would be educational and add some weight, emotion, relatability and gravity to the Great Irish Famine. Noel's tour certainly delivered.

I felt his tour fleshed out and humanised the victims of the genocide that was the Great Famine. A genocide that is globally treated in a light-hearted, joking fashion, largely due to the depictions of the Irish in things like the Simpsons. Noel, tactfully and rightly did not use the ""G"" word, as it may put off those uninitiated to the subject. Regardless, his tour made a lasting impression on my partner and was a great introduction into Irish history.

As a tall ship enthusiast, it was also an absolute pleasure to be aboard. I will be recommending a tour aboard the Jeanie to family, friends and colleagues visiting Dublin Visited during a freezing rainy gale.. It was a great chance to see what it would be like on deck at sea in a storm..  albeit we were in 21st Century kit! The Jeanie Johnston is Fantastic It is such a fantastic story and our guide was brilliant. The boat is amazing especially below deck, you really get a sense of what it was like. The end of the story is truly awe inspiring BUT you will have to visit for yourself to find out what happened. The ticket gives access to Epic The museum which is truly EPIC a real view of Irish history but in a modern digital immersive set of displays. This was deinately a highlight of our trip to Dublin and we certainly recommend it goes on your itinerary I am so happy I was able to squeeze in the tour of the Jeanie Johnston unexpectedly on my last day in Dublin.  Shocking, touching, deeply moving facts and personal stories. The visual renderings of life on the ship was actually shocking. I was literally moved to tears during this tour. Our guide was incredible, so knowledgeable, personable. A remarkable and important piece of Ireland's history, and for a woman of the Irish diaspora, keenly informative and evocative. It was amazing, if you love history you cannot miss this place, never seen a guide as passionate as him, Garoge was amazing and wish to have stayed my wife and I to talk more for he have so much knowledge and made a complex history look accessible to all. I strongly recommend don't miss it you would regret it. Visited the Jeannie Johnston in Dublin and it was amazing. It's a replica of a 19th-century ship that brought emigrants to North America. Great for understanding Ireland's history. You have to do the tour to learn how this ship managed to have 0 deaths. Highly recommend!"
88,The Joker's Chair,4.75,"Best city in the city centre public park. Don't need tickets for the public ok  lovely in the summer. Really good, I get like I was the Joker from the Batman Beautiful memorial, and the park is so peaceful <3 An interesting Joker Chair in the center of the garden, you can sit on it nan nan nan nan"
89,The National Wax Museum Plus,4.0,"This is just a fun place to visit. From dinosaurs to faerie history you get an entertaining wax museum with a number of interactive activities and exhibits. Nice staff and of course the obligatory store at the end of the exhibit.

They even have a haunted house section with a couple of very effective jump scares. Went here twice, don't know why I did as I seem to be deathly afraid of the wax figures.. I cried the first time I visited from sheer terror. The second time I went I was pleased to see Game of Thrones figures and a Hannibal Lector, but I can't help but feel the eyes of the figures watch me as I walk through the rooms. Some of the figures definitely look better than others but all of them are fear inducing. Tickets are also a bit overpriced but that's Dublin for you. If you're at a loss for something to do then go for the experience, but if you're terrified of wax figures like me, maybe reevaluate your decisions Very beautiful statues and very interesting museum
We had a lovely time with the family
But the visit is quite short and not necessarily worth the price.
The haunted hotel part is very nice but be careful with children it can scare them
The staff are very friendly and welcoming and have made a lot of effort to reduce the language barrier Ireland's f wax museum was set up in 1804 by and has had many reincarnations since. Scientists, artists, and those who fall somewhere in between have been obsessed with creating the perfect fake human for centuries. As early as the Middle Ages, wax figures representing deceased royals and clergymen were displayed to allow the living to pay their respects ""in person"" to the objects of their veneration. It is a unique museum with an extensive collection of wax figures, interactive exhibits, and immersive experiences, providing visitors with an entertaining and educational journey through Irish history, culture, and popular culture. My favourite part is a corner with Irish scientist names, also was good to recognize figures without reading wall stend. It was okay, we purchased tickets on groupon so it only cost us around PS11 each for a ticket. Characters are dated and a lot of younger visitors wouldn't really know who they were looking at etc. I personally wouldn't go again if I was to return to Dublin but if your visiting the city and have 30 minutes to waste then pop in. Very interesting place. The figures are not made 100% realistic but the layout is great and quite interactive. The spooky hotel was a good one!
Recommend to those visiting Dublin It's a nice little museum although the scenes and characters are a bit mixed and disparate. We had a good time there but if I have to compare with Grevin, I would say that it costs a little expensive EUR18 for a 1h30 visit if you really take the time We went, the family rated it neat and cool.  It has many photo op places, has history, science, a mirror maze, a horror section, and a neon like section - Tir Na Nog.  Overall it was enjoyable.  Good to check out with a family
You should buy your tickets ahead of time."
90,The Phoenix Monument,4.625,"Beautiful monument at the center of the park with the irish presidential house on one side and US ambassador house on the other side...
If you have luck you can get to see the deer's jumping from one side of the walk way to the other side...
Very green and beautiful picture scenes all over the park with blooming flowers. Magnificent park. Large expanses of greenery. It feels good to recharge your batteries. Monuments are throughout the park. You will even have the chance to come across a deer farm  The monument is in a traffic circle on a columns with a statue that looks more like a chicken than the Phoenix. A very beautiful park almost 1700 acres. There is lot to do in this park.The Wellington Monument  is an obelisk.
It  is situated at the southeast end of the Park, overlooking Kilmainham and the River Liffey. The structure is 62 metres tall, making it the largest obelisk in Europe built in 1817-1861 to commemorate the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. A monument in the middle of the lovely park, we had the pleasure to see the park all green and full in bloom. The bus tours that goes around the city passes this as well. Lovely monument located in the roundabout at Aras An Uachtarain.  The Phoenix Park is a fantastic spot for a walk any time of year. Beautiful Dublin&Relaxing time&Great memory. High Monument at the roundabout in the phoenix park. It isn't really a attraction."
91,The Spire,4.375,"A very unique looking monument. It resembles a 120m tall metal needle.  So it's easy to find and recognize, a perfect meeting point. We actually were on a mission to find this spire. It's an interesting landmark that towers over the city of Dublin. Its sleek - the design and height are pretty impressive. If you're in Dublin be sure to visit. The Spire, a towering monument of modern design, stands as an emblem of Dublin's evolution and dynamism. Rising majestically from the heart of O'Connell Street, it symbolizes the city's journey towards a vibrant, forward-thinking future while honoring its rich history and cultural heritage.

Designed by British architect Ian Ritchie, the Spire was conceived as part of Dublin's Millennium Spire project, a visionary endeavor to create a contemporary landmark for the new millennium. Its slender form, constructed from stainless steel, reaches an impressive height of 120 meters (almost 400 feet), soaring above the bustling streets below.

The Spire's construction marked a transformative moment for Dublin, replacing the once-iconic Nelson's Pillar, which had stood on the same site until its destruction in 1966. Unlike its predecessor, which celebrated British naval hero Horatio Nelson, the Spire represents a departure from historical associations, embracing a more inclusive and forward-looking vision for the city.

Since its unveiling in 2003, the Spire has become an integral part of Dublin's urban landscape, captivating residents and visitors alike with its sleek, minimalist design and commanding presence. Its reflective surface catches the sunlight by day, casting ever-changing patterns of light and shadow, while at night, it is illuminated by a dazzling array of LED lights, transforming it into a radiant beacon in the darkness.

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Spire serves as a symbol of Dublin's resilience, creativity, and cultural diversity. It stands as a testament to the city's ability to embrace change while staying true to its roots, embodying the spirit of innovation and progress that defines Dublin as a global capital.

As a cherished landmark and meeting point, the Spire holds a special place in the hearts of Dubliners, serving as a gathering place for celebrations, protests, and moments of reflection. It stands as a reminder of Dublin's ongoing transformation and its enduring spirit of resilience, unity, and hope for the future. Marvel at The Spire of Dublin, an iconic landmark soaring into the skyline at O'Connell Street. This stunning monument, also known as the Monument of Light, stands 120 meters tall and is a celebrated piece of modern art and engineering. Its sleek, stainless steel surface catches the light and the eye of anyone walking down the street. The Spire is a must-visit for those interested in contemporary design and serves as a focal point in the heart of the city. Despite its modern origins, the Spire of Dublin has already accumulated its own legends. Some locals humorously claim it was designed to prevent pigeons from perching, while others see it as a beacon of hope, especially during Ireland's Celtic Tiger economic boom. However, no official legend or myth surrounds the Spire; instead, it stands as a contemporary symbol of Dublin's spirit and resilience. The Spire of Dublin is a magnificent landmark towering over the city. Its sleek design and impressive height make it a must-see attraction for visitors to Dublin.  Definitely worth a visit! The Spire O'Connell St
You can walk in the middle of the pavement to it but be aware cars pass through the road which can be deceiving.
There are plenty of tours passing here, in native languages and usually stop to discuss the rich history and culture of Dublin. It's cool, I guess.  It's just a giant pole that goes into the sky.  The symbolism is cool."
92,The Umbrellas Dublin,2.75,"Not really anything special to see here.  Don't go out of way / waste time trying to find it.  If you close spend maybe 30 sec to do a photo or just borrow mine / someone else's. Otherwise solid nopes. Very cool's spot in an alley!  Some cool shops along the way in this hidden spot. Worth a stop. Very cool to see! Be advised they are located in a true service road / alley and had several trucks parked underneath both times we went by. Unintentionally passed by this lovely alley with colorful umbrellas hung in the air. No need to visit deliberately but if you pass by it's also a good place to take cute photos. Big scam there are almost no umbrellas and the street is not necessarily pretty
But the perpendicular streets are quite nice with a lot of shops Cool but underwhelming.  We thought it would be much longer, but were surprised at how short it was. Basically a couple minute stop Severely underwhelmed. Good for a photo but nothing else. Wouldn't bother going out of your way to see It is good, nothing very special though"
93,The Wishing Hand,4.375,"The wishing hand - in the Department of Education yard, so make sure you go during the day! The grounds are nice, there is a security guard as well. A block from the main street! A good photo op! We had overcast weather and not much light, but this is Ireland for you! Birds soil the hand but it wasn't bad, one can still fit in for the picture! A 5 min detour and a good one to peek at! The security guard there was amazing and even took the picture for me. Definitely a sight you have to stop by and see and make a wish. The Wishing Hand - Try making a wish at the Wishing hand. Free to look at! Make a wish...if you wish  Not much here other than a hand, you can't even sit on the grass without being moved along. Quick photo and move along. The church across the road is much better Unfortunately it was closed so couldn't go near it, but got photos I work near this for the last 15 years. Known as a helping hand in education. It was cool, I know, we get tempted to take pics and I did it XD. You can fit in the hand!"

95,Tourist Office Dublin,2.125,"It's not the real tourist office. It's an office which sells tours that's why they are not really good about information. The real one is perfect and is situated near Dublin Castle. We were there twice to find out.

We came across the first person who neither greeted us nor smiled, but rather gave us huffs and very shaky advice. Sir, why do you work at the Dublin tourist office if you don't like tourists?

After this useless exchange, we went back and found a smiling, polite person who gave us extremely good advice! We thank her for this advice! When we ask what there is to do in Dublin for a day we come across a French woman who explains to us that apart from the bus tour which costs EUR30 there is nothing to do, I find it a shame to only talk about what is for sale in the Office. We thought we would have at least a walking route or that we would be recommended a museum to visit. We booked a tour to Moher cliffs and Galway...everything was amazing and Finn best coach driver ever!!!! See you next time, thankssssss!!! Very disappointed with the information on the sightseeing buss. I buy my 3 tickets on Thursday at 1 p.m. from a French seller so no communication problem between us. I ask when the 24 hour validity of the tickets starts and she replies ""when you first board the bus, the QR code on the ticket is scanned and your 24 hour hop on hop off period starts"". The next day, Friday, at 11 a.m. we start our first ride on the bus. The driver doesn't scan anything and just looks at the tickets. Later we have lunch and around 2 p.m. we take the bus again. We then see on the ticket that the validity period ended on Friday at 1 p.m.!!! So, either the saleswoman (student coming from Toulouse for the summer) is incompetent or she lied. But EUR28 per person for 2 hours of service provided is completely overpriced. Prefer city buses with a travel guide, cheaper and just as effective. We bought a bus ticket to the airport, the representative give us the wrong address (its not not infront of the castle (we were with baggage) - its half km away!!!!),
did not give us the bus number, ans said the the station is visible (lilttle sign, we almost missed him) Don't trust the opening times! We arrived at 5:45 pm and everyone had already left and the cleaning lady sent us away. We traveled half an hour to the office to book a tour we were gonna do that evening. Very annoying! The staff were friendly though the next day Great that you can leave your luggage here whilst your your the city; however they closed the shop whilst they had a meeting and you could not collect your bags! It was only after a crowd gathered that someone came out."
96,Touristy Private Guided Tours of Ireland,5.0,"We had an amazing day with Miriam. Our tour was Newgrange and she treated my eleven year old son and myself like family. Miriam is extraordinarily professional, she reached out the day before the tour to set up the pick up, arrived five minutes early, gave us the lay of the land at Newgrange and connected with the ticket counter to know when we would be done there. It was a lovely day exploring a beautiful part of Ireland. She anticipated our very need and even added a sweet treat stop for my son (his favorite part of the day). My favorite part of the day was hearing from Miriam about Ireland while observing the fabulous scenery that Ireland has to offer! Miriam made several recommendation about what else to do in Ireland and we took them all! She even dropped us off at one of the locations to help us maximize our day. I highly recommend this tour company ! Noel was so patient while we waited to disembark from our cruise ship, delayed by fog. He managed to get us to all the places we had planned in a slightly abbreviated tour. He is knowledgeable,  pleasant, and funny. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with him! Wonderful experience!   Miriam was so professional and contacted us the night before.  She worked with our schedule and    was so knowledgeable on the places we visited at Newgrange and Hill of Tara.    Even had us stop at few places we didn't know about that were on the way back.  Highly recommend this tour company! We had a lovely day exploring Newgrange and the Hill of Slaine with Noel yesterday. Highly recommend! Noel and Touristy were a pleasure to work with. Especially enjoyed touring the monastery ruins at the Hill of Slain, we had the place all to ourselves. We had a great time on our private tour!  Noel was very knowledgeable and we had the perfect amount of time at each stop.  The flexibility was great, and each site was amazing! Noel was a fantastic guide for our tour of Dublin. He took the time to keep us out of the tourist traps to get a real feel of Dublin. Thanks Noel. The hubby and I spent a magical day with Miriam today.  We visited Knowth, New Grange, Slaine Castle, and Hill of Slaine.  From insider info on the varieties of Irish potatoes to the in's and out's of Dublin traffic - we learned so much in our time together.  The day was perfection.... Miriam even brought the sunshine with her. Many thanks Miriam - until we meet again. There's a reason this tour guide service has only five-star reviews: they're amazing. Noel was our guide and he made sure we had an absolutely wonderful time seeing Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, and other extremely unique and cool spots off the beaten path.  There were a large number of complications in arranging this tour, all on my end, and Bradley was incredibly patient and kind from beginning to end. A first class operation and we'll be sure to use their services when we return to Ireland."
97,Unearthed Tours Dublin - Free Walking Tours Of Dublin,5.0,"10/10 would highly recommend this tour if you have a few hours to spend in Dublin. City tours can be so tour-guide specific and we absolutely loved ours. Our tour guide was Steven, and he had lots knowledge of the area and the history of Ireland in general. We also appreciated his tongue in cheek humor to make the few hours we spent together more entertaining as sometimes tours can get a bit stale when learning so much history packed into a short amount of time. He really made sure we all had a great time while learning. We also appreciated his answers when we asked questions between stops, he was very thorough in his answers and we loved chatting with him.

We've been on many city tours and this was hands down in our top 2 ever!! I had two tours yesterday one in the morning where Jack(the guide) with a purple umbrella will guide us through the city and tell stories about Dublin beginning. I have learnt so much and I am glad I had this experience.

He was engaging quite well with the group, very enthusiastic and proud of his country and made everything so enjoyable.

The second one was an evening tour and it was good. Could not have had more fun with Steve! Visiting in February and had only 24 hours in Dublin, this was a great way to see more city sites and learn more history. Is there anything better than an Irishman telling dark stories on a windy night in Dublin? I hope I'm saying this right bc I'm still learning, but: it was good craic.  Ciaran was our guide for the walking tour, and he was fantastic! He was informative and thoroughly explained things in a way that kept our group engaged. He was absolutely hilarious. I adored him. I would recommend his tour to anyone. Tara is an incredible guide through Dublin and Irish history being truly 'as Dubliner as possible' as she says. It was engaging to walk with her through the city streets and listen to her amazing stories about the highlights and heritage of Ireland and Dublin. Her gift for storytelling together with excellent sense of humour made the tour really memorable. She is also open for questions and dialogue, making it all even more meaningful and fun. Tara's tips for further exploring of the city and good places to visit such as pubs, restaurants, live music venues and everything else was also priceless. I would highly recommend the tour with Unearthed Tours as it's a great way to start your Dublin and Irish journey or complete the existing image about it. If you happen to lack time for exploring city further, it will also give you just enough insights. Big thanks to Unearthed Tours and Tara. In a word: Fantastic. I brought a group tour to Ireland, and Annemarie and Cillian worked with us to coordinate booking the tour for multiple folks, combining us into our very own tour. They went above and beyond to accommodate our large group.

Cillian, our tour guide and the co-owner, was knowledgeable and entertaining. He truly cares about Irish history and lore. This is more of a historical tour than strictly paranormal, and that was just fine with us. If you're looking for a jump-scare type of tour that presents as a haunted house, this isn't it. If you want to learn about some of the things that actually happened in Dublin history and left an energetic mark on the place, then do book this tour.

There is a fair amount of walking, so plan for that, and be prepared to learn a lot about this history of the city of Dublin. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Ciaran was the best guide I had in all 36 countries I've visited in my life. He's not only very knowledgeable, providing plenty of information about Dublin and Ireland, but delivers an extremely interesting and fun walking. His energy and enthusiasm are contagious and his advices on what to visit are precious! I'm very glad to have booked the walking tour and would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin! What a great first tour in Dublin! Our guide gave us such great stories as we walked around and we learned a lot about the dark side of Dublin!"
98,Viking Legacy Trails,5.0,"he brought history to life for our kids- best part of our trip! I have a child with autism and Bren was super accommodating, personalising the tour to accommodate both my sons. On the day of the tour, there was no way my kids were going to do a walking tour in the cold, wet rain but I didn't want to cancel! Bren agreed to come to our hotel to give his presentation in the lobby. He lugged all of his gear and weapons and props and heavy shields to us without complaint (10 stars for that!). He was engaging and kind; dressed them up (complete with viking war paint) and told them stories, took lots of pics and taught them to sword fight. Battling a viking to the ground was the hi light of our trip. We look forward to coming back to Dublin- when it's sunny- and doing the actual tour in the viking quarter! Definite must do - rain or shine! Absolutely Phenomenal Viking Tour Experience with Bren!

Where do I even begin? Bren took us on a journey through Viking history that felt more like a captivating conversation with an old friend than a traditional tour. His depth of knowledge is astounding, weaving history seamlessly with humor, making every moment both enlightening and enjoyable. Behind his Viking armor lies a heart of gold, evident in his genuine care for his country and its rich heritage. The only downside? The tour ended too soon! Bren, you're a true master of your craft, and we're eagerly anticipating what the future holds for you.

Thank you for an unforgettable experience! I'ts the most amazing, passionate, full of history tour. It was such an excellent time that completely overcome the expectations! Walking with a ""real"" Viking around medieval Dublin, getting to know such amazing details that couldn't been told in those regular same like tours. It's a mandatory point on Dublin's checklist of things to do and the host makes it so worthy, interesting and exciting! Imagine a Viking with the most nice and enthusiastic character that will make you fall in love with Ireland!
Absolutely loved it and 100% recommend it! I loved the viking tour! Bren loves his history, and is really knowledgeable. His costume and his weapons are amazing and he makes the tour enormous fun as well as really interesting. You will see much more than you would just walking round on your own. 100% recommend! This was an incredible tour! It included the perfect amount of information and ground covered. The guide was deeply knowledgeable and passionate about Viking history, it was infectious! Everyone should take this tour, it was a fantastic way to experience Dublin. My friend  Helen and myself did a tour with our own Private Viking Bren.
We had a ball from begining to end.
Bren is passionate about our Viking heritage and his knowledge of the subject  is amazing.
It was eye opening.
It is such a shame that Wood Quay has been built over in favour of a cement monstrosity.
Our heritage is so much more valuable  to us than an office building.
Thank you Bren it was a blast.
Pauline  and Helen.
Kilkenny. Bren was amazing!  He has a deep and rich understanding of Viking culture and knowledge.  He also is a phenomenal story teller and keeps your interest.  He was in the show called Vikings and Vikings Valhalla and wears that gear during your tour.  Everyone knows Bren and the kids want to come up and get a pictures with him.  Overall it was a great experience. Bren was our very knowledgeable guide on this vikings tour and was phenomenal. He told stories, was respectful and he is just a standup guy.  He's an actor, body guard, musician, and just a wonderful human who is also all inclusive."
99,Viking Splash Tours,4.75,"The most enjoyable sightseeing tour I've been on in a long while. The guide, Vinny, was pumped with energy and delivered a comedy-club-worthy series of observations warmly mocking Dublin's past and present. The pretty unique amphibious gimmick was just one of several highlights, which included roaring at unexpected passers by. It lasted over an hour - I could have stayed for another. Great fun! Awesome way to see, Dublin and learn some snippets of very important history that makes you want to find out more.

Tour guide was very funny and knowledgeable and a great craic.

Would recommend and come again great for kids and adults. Amazing trip! The tour guide was super friendly! Got to know loads about Dublin history and it has developed over the centuries. Absolutely brilliant tour and would definitely recommend , suitable for adults and kids .  We had Chris and Mary who guided the tour they were both lovely and Chris was hilarious . Lots of humour but also very educational Fabulously funny tour of Dublin through land and water. Our guide Conor (with one N) was very informative as he was funny. Thoroughly enjoyable for all ages, and a must do activity while in Dublin!! ROOOOAARRR!!!!! 

*you have to pre book and arrive 15 minutes early like the email states! They do leave bang on time and will leave without you, as happened to two unfortunate people! (Who were told they'll have to get the next one) but hey rules are rules! Very knowledgeable guide, showed us all the different part of Dublin. Very funny.
The whole ride took about 1 hour or so. About 15 mins of it we went into the water.
The weather was good. Would recommend! Viking Splash is not a classic city tour, but a very funny alternative. We enjoyed the tour with Winnie who was very kind, making us laugh a lot and providing background information about Dublin in a very entertaining, professional way. We would definitely do the tour again. Great fun for young and old. Guide is very funny and knowledgeable. Highly recommended.

The tour brings you from St Stephens Green to Dublin Castle and Christchurch, along the north quays near The Four Courts and past the Customs House - with a drive through Geordian Dublin. The trip includes a boat trip  in Grand Canal basin with a view of the U2 recording studios.

The vihicke used is a DUKW. Our guide advises that these vehicles were built by ladies only for General Motors during World War II, a DUKW is an amphibious six wheel drive vehicle shaped like a boat. They were once used for transporting goods and troops over land and water."
100,Vintage Tea Trips,5.0,"I loved it! We sat on the top deck right behind the VIP seats. There are 4 VIP seats. Two on each side of the bus. All four seats face the direction that the bus is traveling. The seats we had were one forward facing and one facing the back of the bus. Not bad seats at all! We could see everything. The food was good. You could have unlimited drinks but of course you have to be conscious of the fact that there is no bathroom on the bus. They provide a booklet with details of the sights you see. Everyone was friendly. It was a good time! I am very satisfied. The staff were very cheerful, helpful and showed excellent hospitality. The food was delicious, especially the hot scones, which were great value. I was also pleased to be able to take a tumbler of drinks home. I would highly recommend this tour to any tourist as it is a great way to see all the sights of Dublin city at once. Took my mother and 2 aunts on this on our last day in Dublin. Not only was all of the food seriously delicious but the whole staff incredibly friendly. The narrator was funny and entertaining and the bus itself decorated so fun and charmingly. All 4 of us highly recommend this tea and want to give a big shoutout Daniel, Liam and team.
If you're looking to do an afternoon tea in Dublin that's also entertaining, do this! You also get to keep your take away cup, bonus!
We had the VIP seats which gives the best view. The vintage tea bus was an absolute delight! I went with my mom and sister and we really enjoyed our time. It is a great way to see some of the main attractions in Dublin and learn some history, all while sipping tea! All of the staff were extremely nice and welcoming. Adam did an amazing job with describing the points of interest and keeping things entertaining and fun. If you're traveling to Dublin, I definitely recommend booking a tour with them. Had a fabulous time on the vintage bus tour today. All the team were friendly and helpful,  especially Leah as there had been a slight miscommunication between the office & the team on the bus (office had said the vegetarian & daily free option would be Nutella but on the bus it was vegan cheese - which to a child with sensory issues with an aversion to cheese was a big no-no.  But Leah went downstairs and sorted a Nutella sandwich with no problem,  making our experience ((and the whole of the passengers)) much better 
I paid extra for my family to sit at the front,  which was definitely worth it,  even though the heating radiator was blasting out due to being an old route master.
We did this tour mainly because we have done all the other Dublin tours with different companies and wanted something different, which is exactly what we got and thoroughly enjoyed. My sister & I went on the Vintage Tea Trip today and we had a great time.  Adam, Rachel & Leah were very welcoming, friendly and great fun. They attended to our every need. Adam entertained us with some history and fun facts about Dublin City with added humour. As it was a birthday treat for my sister, she was treated to a special surprise and a sing  along to Happy Birthday  Thank you to each of them AND Paddy our very capable and efficient bus driver. It was a wonderful experience which we intend to repeat. I had the most amazing time. Hannah (Montana) was a great tour guide. I though I knew Dublin inside and out but she managed to teach me things! Tea and food were delicious. Anna and Orla served us with a smile and the advice on how to eat the cream was perfect.
Tried this experience on my own but the family and duo next to me looked like they enjoyed themselves as well. 100% would recommend. (Also you get to keep the cups .) On Friday April 19th we went on Vintage Tea tours Dublin on Kitty. Paddy the driver was graciously offered to take our pictures while waiting to board. We had an amazing time Adam, Daniel and Orlaith were always there to get our drinks refilled and providing entertainment while on our journey through Dublin! The sandwiches and desserts were amazing and we finished with hot scones! I would highly recommend this tour!"
101,Walking Dublin Tours,4.714285714285714,"We had an amazing view hours with Brendan and Maurice. From booking to the tour itself, the whole experience was very personal. I wanted something different than the usual Dublin tour for myself and a group of friends who were visiting. I've lived in Ireland for a while now and was keen to learn more about the literary characters and the politics of Ireland and its history. I learned a lot. Maurice has a lot of information to hand and knows just about everything on the history of the city. There are several options for tours on the website and we did the Tribes, Scribes and Bribes but Brendan will organise a bespoke tour if there is something specific you want to learn about. This shows a different side of the city away from all the crowds and doesn't just focus on all the usual tourist spots. Absolutely brilliant. Booked a private tour for some visiting American friends and myself. Very good communication by email and the tour was totally customised for our requirements. As a Dubliner I wasn't expecting to learn much but Brendan was a fountain of fascinating knowledge and brought everything to life for us. I would highly recommend his services as a tour guide. Brilliant history nan nan nan nan"
102,Walking Food Tours - (Dublin),5.0,"We did the Pub Tour with Kevin and had a great time! His local knowledge is awesome. Each of the pubs we visited had distinct qualities and were special places to visit. One of the top highlights of our trip to Dublin. Thank you for a memorable afternoon!! WOW! What a fantastic tour! It was so much more than a food tour. Our guide, Kevin, provided a ton of information about the city's architecture, history, and local stories. Even though I've lived in Dublin and visited countless times since, I still learned so much. The food spots were fantastic and I loved how people were provided suggestions but could make decisions based on their preferences or whatever caught their eye that day too. Talk about a sustainable, interactive, and engaging way to explore the city. Thank you for a great experience! We had the best day with our guide Kevin.. and the food was fab. The extra added touch of Kevin's history knowledge of Dublin along the way was brill. he also does a bar tour too at the weekends!!! Did a walking food tour with Kevin in June of 2024 and couldn't recommend with any higher praise. We do food tours virtually everywhere we travel and this one was one of the best - appreciated his education and history lessons as we wandered around the less touristy parts of dublin and his endless recommendations customized to each and everyone of us. First food tour we'd been on where you did NOT have the food included - not only ended up being way cheaper (even after we ordered everything and then some) but allowed us to customize to our wishes without having to make any effort. For anyone looking for a fun food tour in Dublin, look no further Honestly Kevin and his tour was our groups favorite highlight of Dublin. Kevin is an absolute gem we wanted to stay with him all day so we liked it so much we followed him on the bar tour. His passion and love shines through while talking and guiding us through street food. Our fave was the fish and chips.
Book early in your trip because he has so much knowledge and recommendations for every part of the city. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Kevin has great enthusiasm, is very fun to be around, engages with everyone and knows his stuff! Besides sharing all of the spots you have to go to (did a food and a drinking tour with him on different days) he's also very willing to help you in other aspects on your visit to Dublin. He is so kind and encourages people to contact him for any activity, transportation, directions, etc. that you may need throughout your visit.  That is always a nice feeling when your visiting somewhere new. I also got to meet his wife at the Food Tour and she was an absolute sweetheart, she is also very helpful and looked into recommending an Indian restaurant I wanted to check out in the area. 200% recommend! Enjoy! * We had a fantastic time on this food tour. Kevin and Tracy treated us like family. We loved that food was not included as we were able to customize what we wanted to eat at each stop. Kevin's enthusiasm and hospitality was incredibly welcoming. The history he provided was fascinating and added so much to the over all experience. This was a 10 out of 10 experience. If you're in Dublin it's a must or you will be missing out on a fantastic day! I took the 3 hour walking talking food tour with Kevin on Saturday 08 June 2024. We started with ""breakfast"" at a modern indoor/outdoor Cafe right at the Guinness Brewery area of Dublin.

From the start, Kevin gave great depth of knowledge, tremendous insight into the origins of Irish food and food culture. Highly entertaining, highly informative, highly enjoyable.

After breakfast, we wandered the streets to 4 further locations for ""lunch"", ""dinner"" ""dessert"" and ""dessert"".

While all the food we had was small to medium sized portions, everyone was well and truly satisfied by the time the tour ended. Kevin also gave great recommendations on selections at each stop. There was a person who needed gluten free choices, and a vegetarian in our group. Both were able to choose options at every stop and missed out on nothing.

Some of the foods I enjoyed were
* Sausage Roll (Pear & Black Pudding) & Barista Coffee
* Spicy Beef, Jalapeno, Cheese Toastie
* Traditional Fish and Chips
* Baileys Cheesecake
* Irish Ice Cream (I had 2 flavours: Sea Salt & Chocolate Whiskey)

Thanks Kevin, everywhere we great!"
103,Waterfall Iveagh Gardens,4.875,"Is a wonderful and very quiet place. Dublin doesn't have ugly parks. They are all amazing! Big oasis fan...or in this case waterfall! What better way to get lost in the city than to find a secluded spot in the centre of the city. Watch the water fall and listen to it. So good for the soul. Gardens have so much on offer too. Beautiful stunning park especially when the weather is nice and sunny and hot. This waterfall looks amazing in person and the whole park is just gorgeous.
In the summer months the many grass areas are full of people enjoying the sunshine.

Their is also a football pitch just to the right as you enter the park from the Harcourt Street side.

I highly recommend to all people to have a walk around this park especially people on vacation.
It's just a stone's throw away from Saint Stevens green park. The park was pretty, the waterfall is fake lol, so it doesn't have to be on when you arrive. Not really special, but nice piece of greenery and it's not too crowded. 4/5 Another must-see place in Dublin. Many benches are available. This park is very well maintained which makes it even more pleasant. It is also very calm and relaxing, you want to stay there all day reading or lying on the grass. Idyllic Tranquility: Iveagh Gardens and the Waterfall

One of my favourite place to photograph waterfalls <3

The Iveagh Gardens in Dublin, with its hidden gem of a waterfall, is a place of pure enchantment and natural beauty. This serene haven, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city, offers a blissful escape where visitors can immerse themselves in the soothing sounds of cascading water and surround themselves with the allure of lush greenery.

The highlight of the Iveagh Gardens is undoubtedly the picturesque waterfall. As you approach the cascading waters, you're greeted by a mesmerizing sight and the delightful sound of nature's symphony. The waterfall, with its gentle flow and tranquil ambiance, creates a sense of serenity that instantly transports you to a state of calm and tranquility. Sweet little garden in the middle of the city
Close by coffee shops
Pret managers has bathrooms that was very helpful Great place to spend time"
104,Weaver Park,3.625,"Nice skate park and playground and green area for kids, skaters, skateboarders, young and old and dogs. Just on Cork street. Nice greenery, trees and wooded area and graffiti ramps. I'm truly appalled by what I witnessed today. Someone thought it was perfectly fine to allow their dog to roam freely in a very crowded playground. Predictably, the dog decided to leave a not-so-pleasant surprise right next to the climbing frame while children were using it. It's an absolute disgrace, and we need stricter enforcement of rules regarding NO DOGS in such areas! At the very least, put the dog on a leash. This blatant disregard for the well-being of others is simply shocking.

To make matters worse, the owner's child started throwing tree bark at other children, which speaks volumes about the example they're setting for the young ones they're raising. It's disheartening to see such behavior. Nice open Street style Skate Park, with mini pool, flat ground space. Grindeble ledges. Kids playground Small inner city park that finally gives area children a place to burn off energy. Now the city of Dublin will need to create a Parks & Rec Department to oversee the maintenance of the growing number of parks. Sadly, with cameras in the park teenagers regularly are damaging the park. The Gardai fail to regularly patrol and monitor the park. The city unfortunately appears to have left this park to just fail. The City Council build social housing now around the park on land that once housed community gardens. The other area would have been perfect for a basketball court and a soccer (football) net. Instead the area in the park is no longer safe for families. The locals stay away now because of youth gangs and drugs and alcohol being used openly. It was a welcomed opportunity for such a poor area of the city, but no longer a fun family park. Fun place for the adrenaline heads to meet up and have some fun together love the atmosphere and creativity that happens here on a daily basis Great City park, looks quiet new and we'll maintained. Installations are built from high quality materials.  The only downside is that there is no swings. Playground is best for children from 2 years +. Nice park, playground for kids, skate park for teenage. These are the pics of how the park looks now. A part of the big climbing frame got removed due to it being burnt in a fire."
105,Wellington Monument,4.5,"Very impressive monument and great place to relax on the grass in the surrounding are.

Just shows that if you put in the work and defeat Napolean, people will dedicate a nice pointy stone to you! Much bigger than I expected so impressive, amidst the large green lawns. The reliefs and information on the monument are interesting, albeit limited. A quick visit is enough but manu people go to chill in the area around. Towering over the landscape of Phoenix Park is this colossal monument to the Duke of Wellington - who was born in Ireland. Tributes to his successful military campaigns adorn the sides, but it's the sheer scale of the obelisk which impresses ... it's the tallest in Europe at 62 metres, and it dates back to 1861. A large monument which you can climb up onto part of it with a large green space ideal for lounging in the sun in summer Beautiful, clean, well-maintained place.  Many places where you can walk, many things to see.  There is a zoo nearby, which is very large. It's so massive and the cold simplicity of it makes it even more impressive. It's in the middle of a park, do you can just chill there and relax too. A large monument located at the beginning of Phoenix Park in Ireland.
The monument is located on a huge green field, when you get closer to the column you begin to feel how big it is, although from a distance it doesn't seem so.
A place with a rich history, surrounded by a huge, very well-kept park.
To get there, you need to walk a little from the entrance about 5-7 minutes. Phoenix Park in general is an amazing place. It's quiet, beautiful and peaceful. Perfect spot to walk, cycle, hang with people, meet friends, walk with the dogs, bring the kids... it's a place to everyone that enjoys the green and the nature."
106,Wolfe Tone Park,4.0,"A popular little square with seating and grassed areas. There's a cafe in an old tram in the square. Good location to take a break and it's close to many of Dublin's large shopping centres. Was on a singing walking tour. Nice atmosphere. Coffee and snack hut in a converted tram car. Very urban but a nice place to sit and opt out of the hustle and bustle from the many shops nearby. Well kept little park beside Jervis shopping centre. Nice coffee shop there too. The Tram. The area in some parts   is under a  construction upgrade not sure exactly but it will be finished soon . The is a lovely cafe The Tram which is selling take away fine coffee and tasty food and snacks . There is public toilets with mobility access thats open 7 days a week 10am to 8pm . its spotless , there is security and cleaners on site during opening hours . Big old trees line the sides and solid benches , and old headstones lying on the walled side . its just perfect for welfare break , nice coffee and a tinkle if needed. its very well maintained . Great outdoor place to sit in the city center,  it had the tram cafe and a free seating around it. There is a public toilet as well and all at ground level.  There are usually a lot of people here and also birds/seagulls around waiting to get a bit so not the best place to have a relaxing lunch. There are no shelter for rain and no place for parking but overall a great park in busy city It is difficult to decide how many stars to award as it has been redeveloped a green  public space but as they are waiting for the trees and plants to settle in there is no public access except to the Tram Cafe. It the past I would have liked it except for the fact that it was a magnet for anti-social behaviour. I will give it three stars with a possibility of upgrading to four or five at a later date depending on how well it is managed. Litterally full of addicts and alcoholics that I witnessed on two occasions fighting like something out of homeless Tekken. Then one of the other undesirables set alight to someone's shoes and nearly lit the entire park on fire The only place in city that DC set up toilets. Very well maned and very clean and also could have cup of coffee from the tram sitting on bench"
107,World Poverty Stone,4.25,"Impressive lean face people figures made of stone to conmemorate the many victims of the great famine in Ireland. Very close to the EPIC museum which once was the main departure point in Dublin for many people leaving the country in order to escape from a hard life seaking a better future abroad. World poverty stone unveiled in Dublin. ... The United Nations General Assembly adopted 17th October as its International Day for Eradication of Poverty in 1992, and the day is now observed in more than 100 countries to highlight the struggles faced by poor people throughout the world. Stumbled upon this whilst walking. It was a nice little impromptu history lesson of the poverty and famine faced. No complaints. The World Poverty Stone is a commemorative stone to mark International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. The stone, which is situated between the Famine memorial and Sean O'Casey Bridge. The stone is also embedded in the pavement and easily missed if you're not looking carefully.

Purely from an aesthetic point of view, I wouldn't go out of the way to see it unless you're already going to visit the EPIC exhibition or to see The Famine Memorial.

On the stone the following words are inscribed, ""Whenever men and women are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are violated. To come together to ensure that these rights are respected is our solemn duty"". The sentiments are noble and worthy. A good memorial for the victims of the Irish famine. The views of the river is a plus The sculptures are a memorial work of the Irish people who were forced to emigrate during the famine of the 1800s. I stark reminder of a past that was not too long ago. Human Rights, Poverty, Famine and all beside the River Liffey and the Financial Services Centre of Dublin. Excellent place to visit and ponder....and hopfully act  upon."
