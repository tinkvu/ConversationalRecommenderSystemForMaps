From the moment we entered, it was evident that the zoo is meticulously maintained, with immaculate pathways and well-kept enclosures. The cleanliness of the facilities added to the overall enjoyment of our visit.

While exploring the zoo, we encountered a variety of fascinating animals. However, we were disappointed that we couldn't catch a glimpse of some of the more elusive species such as the lion, snow leopard, and tiger. Despite this, we were thrilled to see magnificent creatures like the giraffes, elephants, and California sea lions. Their habitats appeared spacious and enriched, providing a comfortable environment for the animals.

The highlight of our visit was observing the playful antics of the giraffes and the graceful movements of the elephants. The California sea lion exhibit was also captivating, offering insight into the lives of these charismatic marine mammals.

Overall, our experience at Dublin Zoo was enjoyable, especially on a day with good weather. Although we missed out on seeing a few animals, the cleanliness of the zoo and the opportunity to witness captivating species made it a memorable outing. We look forward to returning in the future to explore more of what Dublin Zoo has to offer.",3 months

ChIJRRL9SksMZ0gRiBtqewjjp4o,Dublin Zoo,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMbHZtbVRREAE,3,"Big fan of the big enclosures for animals. For sure the biggest I've seen in any zoo so far.

This however does mean that it's often hard to find out even see the animals, especially from up close.

Wouldn't recommend going here if you're going because you like photography and are looking to get some cool shots because there's little options for free shots without (dirty) glass or wired fences.

The bigger enclosures also mean that There's not as many different animals as in other zoos, and that was a small disappointment.

Overall good experience, but could be more interactive, and maybe at some places possible to see the animals better.",2 weeks ago,2024-06-18T21:23:41,,,,0,210,442,True,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN90tdFXFRz0m6amYXx1W2jr71HzDj-CXO-Dv_q=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgIARqrH4xUDLJOnKY91dZMFp-PdUqI5K0-J8Q=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcHJ1M4msqpNT5I-fs-5LiO6XQUWhKWWQET55R=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmu8AlEyA3jYEzWjEKYEEjgs-_Y5A2sMek2lJg=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMp80KUXdISjUxS1NMrYxz-BM1qzqoHmsku84F=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwmDE1UqruWkukoxvCuJoZ_15frOGmsFqtT70i=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWL8b6R51UV1lzRipDB2Dgw6lY8Pa6bmy02kTe=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvBkMlOjEkos_VkKE5CaeH-9pqEBcxuWIddyG6=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyXqv4uVSVNtYbpY_cet-0CmJzf4bHB0Qn4DCE=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPadhSJfUoJjqS0snukeNTOG0a6kXgxktUVtXyq=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNF52VK0j1fvQMSC2cwWWp4ms4Ksdv3zt-z0aqH=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"

ChIJRRL9SksMZ0gRiBtqewjjp4o,Dublin Zoo,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMbExQUnhnRRAB,5,"Had been there with my girlfriend to experience zoo after a decade.
The zoo was amazing to be honest and the way they have kept it for the animals is brilliant. Every animal have their space to walk and move freely along with dedicated areas to come closer to audience separated by glass walls.
I personally liked Red Pandas and Sea Lions the most.

We loved that food was not included as we were able to customize what we wanted to eat at each stop. Kevin's enthusiasm and hospitality was incredibly welcoming. The history he provided was fascinating and added so much to the over all experience. This was a 10 out of 10 experience.

From the start, Kevin gave great depth of knowledge, tremendous insight into the origins of Irish food and food culture. Highly entertaining, highly informative, highly enjoyable.

After breakfast, we wandered the streets to 4 further locations for ""lunch"", ""dinner"" ""dessert"" and ""dessert"".

While all the food we had was small to medium sized portions, everyone was well and truly satisfied by the time the tour ended. Kevin also gave great recommendations on selections at each stop. There was a person who needed gluten free choices, and a vegetarian in our group. Both were able to choose options at every stop and missed out on nothing.

Some of the foods I enjoyed were
* Sausage Roll (Pear & Black Pudding) & Barista Coffee
* Spicy Beef, Jalapeno, Cheese Toastie
* Traditional Fish and Chips
* Baileys Cheesecake
* Irish Ice Cream (I had 2 flavours: Sea Salt & Chocolate Whiskey)

Thanks Kevin, everywhere we great!",3 weeks ago,2024-06-08T14:46:09,,,,0,113,445,True,,,[]

But I warn you right away, you need to walk a lot here). You can also rent bicycles at the gate.
As soon as you enter the park, you see many different trees, shrubs and flowers.  Somewhere in the middle of the park there are already large green meadows where you can relax and enjoy the views of various historical monuments.
There is a zoo, a cricket club and various cafes. The park is very large, so it will take more than one day to explore everything. My friends and I purposefully walked to a clearing with deer, many said that we might be unlucky and there wouldn't be any, we wandered for a very long time and finally found it.

The tour brings you from St Stephens Green to Dublin Castle and Christchurch, along the north quays near The Four Courts and past the Customs House - with a drive through Geordian Dublin. The trip includes a boat trip  in Grand Canal basin with a view of the U2 recording studios.

The vihicke used is a DUKW. Our guide advises that these vehicles were built by ladies only for General Motors during World War II, a DUKW is an amphibious six wheel drive vehicle shaped like a boat. They were once used for transporting goods and troops over land and water.",4 months ago,2024-02-05T18:37:28,"Many thanks for your lovely words, we are extremely proud of our beautiful, cultural and friendly city and really love to show our guests the city in it's true light.

ChIJq-FUnZ0OZ0gR9_TAnOCOC7o,Dubh Linn Garden,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUODdfTnhBRRAB,5,"The Dubh Linn Garden in Dublin is a tranquil and historic green space situated behind Dublin Castle, one of the city's most important landmarks. The name ""Dubh Linn"" translates to ""black pool"" in Irish, referring to a dark tidal pool that was once located at the confluence of the River Liffey and the River Poddle, where the garden now lies. This pool is believed to be the origin of Dublin's name.

The garden itself is a serene oasis in the heart of Dublin, offering a peaceful retreat from the bustling city streets. It is beautifully landscaped with lush lawns, manicured flowerbeds, and a variety of trees and shrubs, creating an inviting environment for visitors to relax and enjoy nature. The central lawn is often used for public events and gatherings, contributing to the cultural vibrancy of the area.

One of the key features of Dubh Linn Garden is its intricate Celtic knot design, which can be best appreciated from above. This striking pattern reflects Ireland's rich heritage and adds a unique visual element to the garden. Pathways meander through the garden, inviting visitors to explore and discover its beauty from different angles.

The garden is also home to several sculptures and art installations, enhancing its aesthetic appeal and providing points of interest for art enthusiasts. Among these is the ""Garden of Remembrance"" sculpture, which commemorates the lives lost during Ireland's struggle for independence.

Dubh Linn Garden is easily accessible from Dublin Castle, making it a convenient stop for tourists exploring the city's historical and cultural sites. It serves as a peaceful complement to the castle's grand architecture and storied past, offering a quiet place for reflection amidst the historical grandeur.

Visitors to Dubh Linn Garden can enjoy a leisurely stroll, a quiet moment of contemplation, or a picnic on the lawn, all while surrounded by the garden's natural beauty and historical significance. Its location within the Dublin Castle complex also makes it an ideal spot for those looking to delve deeper into the history of Dublin while enjoying a serene environment.

Overall, Dubh Linn Garden is a hidden gem in Dublin, combining historical importance with natural beauty. It provides a refreshing escape from the urban hustle and bustle, making it a must-visit for both tourists and locals seeking a peaceful and picturesque retreat in the heart of the city.",a month ago,2024-05-19T03:10:19,,,,0,336,1094,True,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlN5DUM8GRTHNH0jmhAxW0hbiDWARGQoy3Giz-=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"

We were totally blown away with all the details, information and visual artifacts on the tour!

I was wondering what it was going to be in here? But was pleasantly surprised!

So much to view and information to take in, it was kind of overwhelming and fascinating!
I loved the visual waterfall that they produced shapes of Guinness
Glasses, The Irish Harp symbol, and their pure water in display, dropping from the ceiling.
It was so quick and clear, but hard to get a good picture of it all.

Also loved the wheat growing in the field section, the colour changes in use wheat and ceiling beautiful!

I was also fascinated with the information of how the Coopers made all the barrels, to hold all the Guinness made.
As a Carpenter myself, had great respect for how hard this job would of been! All done by hand, shaping all this Oak, at great speeds, with only the eye of the tradesman, perfecting the pieces to make the barrels

Information to how they made the Guinness finished product in visuals, was brilliant, learnt so much today.

Then onto the taste testing room, where they done a presentation and we all had a tiny glass of Guinness

Finally, up to the Gravity bar where we had a free pint of the black stuff, a beautiful pint of Guinness each

We managed to share a take and seats with a lovely group of Americans.

We enjoyed our Guinness and the view of the Dublin City landscape, truly fantastic!

Housed within the historic General Post Office building, which served as the nerve center of the Rising, the museum offers visitors a unique opportunity to step back in time and experience the sights, sounds, and stories of this pivotal moment in Irish history.

One of the museum's standout features is the Witness History exhibition, which uses a combination of artifacts, multimedia displays, and interactive technology to bring the events of the Easter Rising to life. Visitors can follow the journey of the rebels as they plan and execute the Rising, experiencing the chaos and confusion of battle through immersive audiovisual presentations.

The museum also delves into the broader context of Irish history, exploring the social, political, and economic factors that contributed to the rise of Irish nationalism and the desire for independence. From the Great Famine to the Land War, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped Ireland's struggle for self-determination.

In addition to its focus on the Easter Rising, the GPO Museum highlights the contributions of key figures in Irish history, including James Connolly, Padraig Pearse, and Countess Markievicz. Personal stories, letters, and artifacts provide insights into the lives and motivations of these individuals, offering a more intimate perspective on the events of the time.

Through its engaging exhibits and educational programs, the GPO Museum seeks to promote understanding, dialogue, and reflection on Ireland's revolutionary past and its relevance to contemporary society. It serves as a reminder of the enduring spirit of resilience, courage, and determination that defined the Irish people in their quest for freedom and independence.",a month ago,2024-05-06T20:58:46,"Hi T atts,

ChIJTey9PoQOZ0gRimcbHe6gLn8,The Spire,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqZy1yUzBBRRAB,5,"The Spire, a towering monument of modern design, stands as an emblem of Dublin's evolution and dynamism. Rising majestically from the heart of O'Connell Street, it symbolizes the city's journey towards a vibrant, forward-thinking future while honoring its rich history and cultural heritage.

Designed by British architect Ian Ritchie, the Spire was conceived as part of Dublin's Millennium Spire project, a visionary endeavor to create a contemporary landmark for the new millennium. Its slender form, constructed from stainless steel, reaches an impressive height of 120 meters (almost 400 feet), soaring above the bustling streets below.

The Spire's construction marked a transformative moment for Dublin, replacing the once-iconic Nelson's Pillar, which had stood on the same site until its destruction in 1966. Unlike its predecessor, which celebrated British naval hero Horatio Nelson, the Spire represents a departure from historical associations, embracing a more inclusive and forward-looking vision for the city.

Since its unveiling in 2003, the Spire has become an integral part of Dublin's urban landscape, captivating residents and visitors alike with its sleek, minimalist design and commanding presence. Its reflective surface catches the sunlight by day, casting ever-changing patterns of light and shadow, while at night, it is illuminated by a dazzling array of LED lights, transforming it into a radiant beacon in the darkness.

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Spire serves as a symbol of Dublin's resilience, creativity, and cultural diversity. It stands as a testament to the city's ability to embrace change while staying true to its roots, embodying the spirit of innovation and progress that defines Dublin as a global capital.

As a cherished landmark and meeting point, the Spire holds a special place in the hearts of Dubliners, serving as a gathering place for celebrations, protests, and moments of reflection. It stands as a reminder of Dublin's ongoing transformation and its enduring spirit of resilience, unity, and hope for the future.",a month ago,2024-05-06T20:55:04,,,,0,336,1094,True,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbzwASxsehGeFyuoyVnF9LUqMTrWtvz7Sff5Vg=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7A6yx9O3L_5qEkjxeNJ9RY3HM-psVlZP4vY-u=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"

Flip our personal tour guide was such a pleasure to spend the day with. His passion for GOT and for sharing his knowledge from an insider perspective as well as a geological perspective were so appreciated.

We filled our day with challenging walks and funny banter from our first meeting to our final goodbye,  Flip made traveling to Ireland after a two and half year wait just exceed my expectations of what this trip could be during winter.  While it was very cold and windy touring the natural sights, Flips ability to transport you back into the GOT movies and envision being there was a bit mind blowing.  I was indeed so happy to have Flips's one on one attention and careful guidance as compared to the big bus tours that would sometimes arrive with no sight guidance.

Flips insider GOT's movie experience and stories made you feel like you had joined and insider community and you had front row tickets.  Booking a personalized private tour with Flip will make you feel like you won the lottery as well as gained a new friend in Belfast. I can honestly say that with all the personalized tours that I have experienced around the world that Flip delivers the most personal, in-depth and curated experience which can only be a 5 STAR rating.",a year ago,2023-01-03T12:12:50,,,,1,3,4,False,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHuEqm6z9Z2ZAM6KEMg1X3-gQkVUblYb5SfVtr=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn5QF1CyXgaZczcx-EW6ImeWF1bjIBMpBSz2SF=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG-6kHCjuRc1uFSdoka7cYyncg3rqg5CBHWhGA=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"

Things to know: You must book tickets in advance and they cost! We didn't know this, we arrived in the morning and were able to book for the evening. They do offer a family deal for entry. The books in the Long Room are being removed to salvage/repair/store. Only two sections had actual books in them. Still fully worth it to see the room, but would be way more impactful with all the books. From the information available, it does not sound like the books will ever be returned to the Long Room. They have added the sculptures of four women to the room (full of sculptures of men), so that was nice. Also, it's hot in there. Like, really really hot. And it was not an uncomfortably hot day in Dublin.

Neither traditional nor historic is the fairly recent custom of tourist, who, according to The Irish Times ""sometime before 2014"", tourists began rubbing the statue's bosom area ""for luck"", with some visitors getting a photo of themselves doing so.
The relatively new practice has been criticsed by some, including Dublin-born singer Imelda May, who associated it with the objectification of women and questioned how ""the only statue in Dublin with breasts is basically assaulted in front of our children's eyes daily"".

Our tour guide was very nice, but she spent so much time talking and telling stories that we didn't have time to actually see anything. By the end of the 2.5 hours she was stopping on random street corners and pointing to where things were, rather than actually taking us to see them. We only saw 3-4 of the stops listed on the website. An overall very frustrating experience.

But we spent 90 minutes of the 2.5-hour tour inside Dublin Castle, and most of that time was spent standing in one place hearing various stories and histories. Which was not uninteresting -- it just wasn't what we signed up for. We only saw Christ Church from across the street, because we were running low on time. We then did walk through Temple Bar, but our tour guide only pointed to where River Liffey was -- we never saw it or crossed any bridge. So we did not see the O'Connell Monument, the post office or anything on the North side of the city. And we never went past the Houses of Parliment or Trinity College. Our last stop on the tour was The Old Storehouse. After that, we were dropped back off at the Tree of Gold statue. I have no doubt these tours are typically great, based on all the positive reviews. And again, our tour guide was very nice. Had I not expected to see all the things you pointed out, I wouldn't have been as disappointed. But I expected to see a lot of things, and we skipped half that you listed. I hope in the future that our guide will be able to time things out better so that she can get to more of the stops promised on the website.",a month ago,2024-05-12T12:03:23,"Hi Josh. I'm astounded by that review so I'm going to investigate it and get back to u. As u say, we normally get 5 stars. Kind regards. Pat Liddy

I'm still puzzled. You were taken to Dublin Castle, Christ Church Cathedral, the former Viking & Medieval Quarter, Temple Bar, the River Liffey and its bridges, the Historic cafe/bar The Church, Henry Street, O'Connell Street,The General Post Office, Daniel O'Connell Monument, College Green, the 18th century former Houses of Parliament and the outside of Trinity College. There would have been a number of other little gems along the way. What works for one person may not work for someone else. I understand that. The other folks on the tour showed their appreciation of the tour to the guide at the end even though she didn't look for any gratuities, as is our norm. I'm sorry, that for you, it didn't work out and I can offer you a complimentary tour the next time that you are in Dublin. Again, apologies, if it didn't prove enjoyable for you personally.

Nestled in Dublin, this museum, also known as the ""Dead Zoo,"" is a treasure trove of biodiversity, offering visitors a glimpse into the wonders of nature through its extensive collection of specimens.

As I stepped into the museum, I was greeted by the grandeur of its Victorian-era architecture, which exuded a sense of history and nostalgia. The building itself was a testament to the museum's rich heritage, providing a fitting backdrop for the awe-inspiring exhibits that awaited inside.

The museum's collection spans a wide range of natural history disciplines, including zoology, geology, and paleontology, with each gallery offering a unique perspective on the diversity of life on Earth. From towering skeletons of prehistoric giants to delicate taxidermy specimens of exotic birds and mammals, every corner of the museum was filled with wonders to behold.

One of the highlights of my visit was the museum's iconic ""Balcony of Beasts,"" where rows of glass cases displayed a menagerie of animals from around the world. From lions and tigers to elephants and giraffes, the lifelike dioramas offered a glimpse into the habitats and behaviors of these magnificent creatures.

Moreover, the museum's educational displays and interactive exhibits provided valuable insights into topics such as evolution, ecology, and conservation, making it an enriching experience for visitors of all ages. Whether it was learning about the geological history of Ireland or discovering the intricate adaptations of insects, there was always something new and fascinating to explore.

Overall, my visit to the National Museum of Ireland - Natural History was a truly memorable and enlightening experience.

Some of the original belongings of the Wilde family are still in place (ie: a collection of books by Oscar and his parents, the Irish oak floorboards, neo-classical reliefs decorating the walls,and coloured windows). It is a different house visit compared to the norm - Oscar's family had to sell the house a long time ago, because despite the success Oscar's father ended up in misery (as well as Oscar himself).

The building is now home of the American College Dublin, with the guided tours about Oscar's life being managed by a registered charity. The funds raised from the house visits are used to cover the house restauration expenses.

I would definitely recommend the visit, the house is still a precious testimony of his life and also the director is so engaging in telling the family anecdotes besides having a wealth of knowledge on Oscar Wilde's incredible life.",a year ago,2023-03-12T16:54:41,"Thank you Stefania for your kind comments.

ChIJf-da8IQOZ0gR_s4V4dsZx5s,O'Connell Monument,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqZzRxOFJnEAE,5,"The O'Connell Monument, a towering tribute to Daniel O'Connell, is not just a statue; it's a powerful symbol of Ireland's struggle for independence and the enduring legacy of one of its most influential leaders. Daniel O'Connell, known as ""The Liberator,"" was a driving force behind the movement for Catholic emancipation and the repeal of discriminatory laws against Catholics in Ireland.

Designed by the esteemed sculptor John Henry Foley, the monument stands as a majestic landmark at the southern end of O'Connell Street, Dublin's principal thoroughfare. It was unveiled in 1882, years after O'Connell's death in 1847, as a fitting tribute to his tireless efforts to advance the cause of Irish freedom and equality.

The monument itself is a masterpiece of Victorian-era sculpture and architecture. At its pinnacle stands a commanding statue of Daniel O'Connell, depicted in a dignified pose, his outstretched hand gesturing toward the future. Surrounding him are four allegorical figures representing the virtues that defined his life and legacy: Patriotism, Fidelity, Courage, and Eloquence. These figures, crafted in bronze, serve as eternal guardians of O'Connell's vision and ideals.

The monument's Corinthian column, rising over 50 feet into the Dublin skyline, is adorned with intricate carvings and ornamental details, a testament to Foley's artistic skill and craftsmanship. At its base, four bronze winged victories hold laurel wreaths, symbolizing the triumph of justice and the enduring spirit of the Irish people.

Over the years, the O'Connell Monument has become more than just a statue; it's a place of pilgrimage, remembrance, and reflection for countless visitors from around the world. It stands as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought for Irish independence and a beacon of hope for future generations.

As Dublin's most iconic landmark, the O'Connell Monument continues to inspire and unite the people of Ireland, reminding them of their shared history and the enduring values of freedom, justice, and equality for all. It remains a testament to Daniel O'Connell's indomitable spirit and his unwavering commitment to the cause of Irish liberation.",a month ago,2024-05-06T20:51:21,,,,2,336,1094,True,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbUQNUNVc3A9U2i8trsI_BF4UDeAAqLxqDv1gh=w150-h150-k-no-p"", ""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpH1Fs_8PIjsYOXraPUNWf37lFIi62zNFoikSq=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"

For some reason my father always referred to this as the Guinness Malting Tower. However, this structure was not owned by Guinness and in fact it was the largest smock windmill Europe and it was and was built as part of the Roe whiskey distillery in 1757. The Thomas Street Distillery, run by the Roe Family, was once the largest in the Britain and Ireland, with an output of two million gallons per annum at its peak. After the distillery was closed in 1926, some of its buildings were purchased and incorporated into the Guinness Brewery.

A few years ago Diageo, the owners of Guinness, resurrected the original brand and launched a non-chill filtered, 45% ABV premium blended whiskey under the name ""Roe & Co"" in March 2017.",a year ago,2023-06-11T20:20:03,,,,3,384,9848,True,,,[]

The same Sylvester Costigan is still buried at St James' Church in Dublin which is being converted into a distillery now. Historical evidence shows Costigan was the one who rebuilt the windmill in 1810. Roe dynasty appears to have swindled it from Costigan.

It was built in 1757 and was the largest smock windmill in Europe used to power the Roe Whiskey Distillery. A smock mill is a type of windmill that consists of a sloping sides that resembled smocks worn by farmers in the Netherlands, where their construction originated. George Roe and Company started their company here in the 1750's and by 1887 it had expanded into the largest distillery in Europe. At that time the Thomas Street Distillery covered 17 acres and was producing 2 million gallons of whiskey annually. Roe Whiskey was exported to the United States, Canada and Australia as well as to all over Europe. The Row family became so wealthy that they even funded the restoration of Christ Church Cathedral. By the turn of the new century however the whiskey industry went into a global decline. By 1926 the distillery had ceased producing whiskey but held large quantities of unsold stock in storage. In the mid 1940's the company finally dissolved and in 1949 the next door neighbours, a little unknown company called Guinness bought the entire site!

ChIJ92R9RHIOZ0gRZKpUjr8-gpY,Experience Gaelic Games,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dGZ1d1Z3EAE,5,"This tour was so fun and a great way to understand the history of these traditional Irish sports.  The experience has super friendly and patient trainers.  The trainers teach you the rules and skills step by step, which then allows you to play a short game.  The tour can be as intense or as relaxed as you want.  It was a very memorable experience and I would highly recommend doing this tour for an Irish experience.

The experience is about 3 hours long and you learn three sports:  the first is handball (not the same as Olympic handball - more like squash or racquetball).  Then, they teach you the rules of
hurling, which is like field hockey mixed with lacrosse mixed with baseball mixed with cricket.   The last sport they teach you is gaelic football.  That is like basketball mixed with soccer mixed with volleyball and also like American football or rugby.  They take breaks between each sport to explain the rules and give you glasses of water.  The facilities are very nice as well.

It is super interesting to learn the history of these sports, how they came to be, and how the Gaelic Athletic Association is an amateur sporting association -- in fact, it is the largest amateur sports association in the world.  Each neighborhood in Ireland has its own club, and the residents play only for their area clubs.  The association does not have any professional players - just amateur players.  They explained how previously the British would ban or restrict their ability to play these traditional sports.  Recently there has been a resurgence in these traditional sports, which is great to see right now.  The trainers also answer all of the questions you may have about any of the sports, how to play the sports,
or even about life in Ireland.

In conclusion, this experience playing Irish sports is the best and most fun way to experience your time in Ireland, especially if you are traveling with children who like to do active things while on vacation in a foreign country.  As a parent, this experience is a great alternative to indoor activities such as video games, youtube, chess, or other games you may play indoors.  I can not recommend this experience enough.  My children are still talking about the three sports even though it is over.  They will remember this experience forever and playing Gaelic sports will be a highlight of the vacation for them.",3 months ago,2024-03-19T14:30:57,,,,1,101,14,True,,,"[""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCf5Kt9Or0-Yn4sIkSkPVFHRvWIlirppZVVhvx=w150-h150-k-no-p""]"

We do have a lot of different figures from different walks of life, each well-known in their own right, so you never know who you might discover at the museum. The horror section can be quite scary and yes we do jump scares down there from time to time but you never know when. The Management National Wax Museum Plus.

I cried the first time I visited from sheer terror. The second time I went I was pleased to see Game of Thrones figures and a Hannibal Lector, but I can't help but feel the eyes of the figures watch me as I walk through the rooms. Some of the figures definitely look better than others but all of them are fear inducing. Tickets are also a bit overpriced but that's Dublin for you. If you're at a loss for something to do then go for the experience, but if you're terrified of wax figures like me, maybe reevaluate your decisions",a month ago,2024-05-17T23:31:26,"Hi!

Scientists, artists, and those who fall somewhere in between have been obsessed with creating the perfect fake human for centuries.

It is a unique museum with an extensive collection of wax figures, interactive exhibits, and immersive experiences, providing visitors with an entertaining and educational journey through Irish history, culture, and popular culture.

I booked onto this last minute after finding it a stone's throw away from the Guinness Storehouse and I'm glad I did! John our tour guide was knowledgeable, passionate and humourous, taking us on the journey of the church that now is a distillery. I loved hearing about the past (which appeased the history buff in me), present and future on a fast pace yet relaxed tour, that culminated with drinking whiskey (and gin) where the pews would have been in the church. I booked the legacy tour, which was cracking and gave an insight into to most of their offer.

We visited several beer breweries and whiskey distilleries and this was BY FAR the best. I would highly recommend this tour above any other. Other places such as Guinness can handle a lot of people but this one was the most informative and best experience! We booked a tour online had no wait time. Our tour guide JOHN was phenomenal. Very professional, personable and friendly. John is very knowledgeable and provided a riveting tour on the history of the land, church, and whiskey. Although I had been to other tours and museums I did not fully understand the process behind distilling. John explained it in such a way that it clicked for me and it was just a valuable tour. I absolutely loved the added history of the location of the graveyard. He even added historical context of other distilleries, monuments and historical figures. The church in which the distillery is absolutely breathtaking. Also...the whiskey was very good. I throughly enjoyed the tasting and discussing the flavors and experiences elicited. We also added drops of water to the whiskey which was so fun to experiment with. 10 out of 10 would recommend the tour with John. It was certainly one of the most enjoyable moments in Dublin. I now feel so much more educated in whiskey, gin and the Pearse company. I look forward to experiencing more of Pearse whiskey.

Yesterday I brought my Italian partner to the Jeanie with the hope it would be educational and add some weight, emotion, relatability and gravity to the Great Irish Famine. Noel's tour certainly delivered.

I felt his tour fleshed out and humanised the victims of the genocide that was the Great Famine. A genocide that is globally treated in a light-hearted, joking fashion, largely due to the depictions of the Irish in things like the Simpsons. Noel, tactfully and rightly did not use the ""G"" word, as it may put off those uninitiated to the subject. Regardless, his tour made a lasting impression on my partner and was a great introduction into Irish history.

As a tall ship enthusiast, it was also an absolute pleasure to be aboard.

Yet there is method in the madness as the rustic industrial feeling of the statue is echoed in the background with a hulking rusting ancient Victorian creation over the water. The hair/beard as metal wires further reinforces this theme. There's over 270 statutes dotted across Dublin. This is my favourite and I'm sure loads of other folk's favourites. The reason is that it reflects its environment & also the expression on Luke's face. Too many public artworks of notable people have them with either neutral facial expression or a gentle smile.

Treated marble was used for the formation of the head while treated metal wire was used to form the hair and beard. The hair is attached through the use of a metal mesh wig while the moustache is made of individual pieces of wire which were drilled into the face of the statue. An initial model with hair was made in smaller near life sized form. A secondary larger statue was then created from plaster but without hair. This second statue was then used for 3D scanning to create the final larger sized version replicated in marble via a 5-axis cnc milling machine in Italy. The appearance is based on a distinctive pose of Luke Kelly with his eyes closed while performing and is said to be taken from a still from his performance of Scorn Not His Simplicity on a show hosted by Jim McCann in 1974 called 'McCann Man'.

An influential organiser for workers' rights, his role in the Easter Rising cemented his legacy, with his particularly cruel execution helping to fan the flames of Irish independence.
Born in Edinburgh, June 5th, 1868, Connolly first went to Ireland as a fourteen year old member of the British Army. He married in Scotland where he became involved in Socialism. In 1896 he moved to Dublin where he founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party and also started a newspaper the Workers' Republic. He spent seven years in America where he lectured and organized. He was an organizer for the Wobblies in the New York area.

Connolly returned to Ireland in 1910 and campaigned for the Socialist Party. Jim Larkin appointed him as Ulster Organiser for the ITGWU in Belfast but in 1913 he came back to Dublin to help during the Lockout. Connolly was one of the founders of the Irish Citizen Army. Throughout his life he wrote and published extensively on Irish and socialist issues.

The park is an extension of Chancery House, a block of Art Deco style council built flats designed in 1934 by the then city housing architect, Herbert Simms.

My understanding has been that the park was locked most of the time because of anti-social activity in the area.

Today I discovered that a number of parks in the area have been re-opened to the public but in the case of Chancery Park access is limited to a few hours a day [8 hours Mon-Tues and 4 hours on Fridays with no access at weekends].

Maybe if enough people visit the hours may be extended.",7 years ago,2016-11-07T21:29:33,,,,4,384,9848,True,,,[]
